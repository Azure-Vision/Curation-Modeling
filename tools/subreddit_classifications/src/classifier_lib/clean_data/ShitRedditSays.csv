ShitRedditSays,removed,violently angry pos needs a bashing
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah guys dont you know you cant joke about anything ever
ShitRedditSays,removed,or it was a joke idk
ShitRedditSays,removed,is he wrong though as the person who commented below him said sex is the physical gender for lack of better words and gender refers to the social position
ShitRedditSays,removed,which is why i said too obviously i respect her as a person before her looks but who needs context
ShitRedditSays,removed,so many snowflakes its like a blizzard in here
ShitRedditSays,removed,im going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he is talking about biological sex of which there are only
ShitRedditSays,removed,im curious not spiteful how is gender a social construct i thought it was based on whether you have the body of a man or a woman please help me understand
ShitRedditSays,removed,can you please give an example of how nonbinary genders have existed in many different societies throughout human history please ive never seen this and would love to be enlightened thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes it is unfortunate white institutions like police and prisons are there to stop black people from raping and robbing those racist cops are always just waiting to gun down a tyrone for expressing his spirit of blackness when robs and murders
ShitRedditSays,removed,has nearly twice the upvotes even in that thread that comment is not the majority opinion
ShitRedditSays,removed,well ya how am i supposed to jerk off watching the a presidential speech with that monkey in the background i for one am happy melania is cumming i identify and trans white cis scumso you cant ban me
ShitRedditSays,removed,i will the moment you stop beheading and stoning people abdul also stop invading europe and raping women you filthy sand nigger
ShitRedditSays,removed,transgendered people are already accepted the majority of society condemns people who attack them and defends their rights however its not anybody elses job to coddle you and make you feel good about who you think you are if they dont know you and just because you think you are a different sex doesnt mean you are that sex your identity needs to be based in some scientific reality or we get a lot of people denying reality in order to push their own agenda or narrative
ShitRedditSays,removed,transgendered people are already accepted the majority of society condemns people who attack them and defends their rights however its not anybody elses job to coddle you and make you feel good about who you think you are if they dont know you and just because you think you are a different sec doesnt mean you are that sex your identity needs to be based in some scientific reality or we get a lot of people denying reality in order to push their own agenda or narrative
ShitRedditSays,removed,and youre conflating gender roles and gender identity gender roles are socially constructed gender roles are what pronouns you have what you wear how you behave gender identity is not socially constructed gender identity is who you are and how you view your body if identity was socially constructed trans people would not exist and everyone who be their assigned gender this is an incredibly important distinction conflating gender identity with gender roles makes it easy for people to dismiss trans people as crossdressers or deny the actual reality of our identity and if youre bringing up biological sex there are several different ways to define that all of which exclude different groups some exclude intersex people some exclude nonbinary people some exclude nonconforming people etc what youre thinking of is better referred to as physical sex rather than throwing in an ambiguous misunderstood and sciencysounding biological in this context its better to think of gender identity which is what trans people mean when they talk about gender as an intrinsicallyinclined subconscious sex ie it is internal and unaffected by other people socialisation or social pressure it is subconscious and not chosen and it is as biologically determined as physical sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,real linguists are descriptivists not prescriptivists thats a crazy claim though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the community hes attracted is cancerous but his content is still good imo i dont know if i agree on the mtv video i dont appreciate the insinuation its my fault white people like myself are privileged but i also do think its a thing and a terrible issue in the us but i dont live there so i dont know if it even refers to me directly im conflicted the message is warped but the idea is good
ShitRedditSays,removed,can you weave a noose from straw
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you refuse to have sex with a woman just because she has facial hair and a penis thats the same as transphobia ftfy redditeur
ShitRedditSays,removed,not sure what that does with anything but ok why are they so fucking obsessed with the mtv video imagine if they were this obsessed with actual racism instead of people calling out white dudes
ShitRedditSays,removed,its what we call each other to be fair
ShitRedditSays,removed,step find several chances to misinterpret feminist ideology or find the fringe elements ie psychological rape refusing to date trans people just for being trans doesnt make sense step combine ridiculously
ShitRedditSays,removed,urgaypwnd
ShitRedditSays,removed,he might be trying the australian style insult to suggest affection but you have to actually know how to compose a sentence and choose proper insults otherwise you just end up looking like an asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,then get the fuck off the website
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah total fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,merry christmas to you autistic fucks too
ShitRedditSays,removed,i subscribed to srs for finds like this thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt their a decent bit of cis men on this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,them darkies steal your tv
ShitRedditSays,removed,hence why i said proper insults its like calling someone left handed its not an insult its just something that someone can be

ShitRedditSays,removed,when people say happy holidays on it honestly seemds kinda weird like theres only one holiday today wyd
ShitRedditSays,removed,i feel so silly for actually studying for my exams when i couldve just stuck my head in the sand until finals week ended
ShitRedditSays,removed,bbut uidfshill wants everyone to think of the rapists
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit realz before feelz except when realz might imply females arent all shallow bitches which they totally are
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt it your case exactly
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank for bringing this post on worldnews to my attention so i could upvote it
ShitRedditSays,removed,antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders might be an exception there
ShitRedditSays,removed,if the only reason you dont harm people is because you realize it would result in inconvenient consequences is that really something to be admired because thats what a lot of redditors do they spout terrible terrible shit online that theyd never say in real life but the only reason they keep it anonymous is because they dont want to be inconvenienced by the backlash
ShitRedditSays,removed,he literally says in the comment men are less likely to be taken seriously so in all actuality he acknowledges your situation is a difficult one
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you capable of feeling empathy or guilt then no youre not a sociopath someone with asd may have a hard time understanding a lot of social interaction but someone with aspd literally does not care when i say inconvenient consequences i dont mean the person is worried that harming will damage s psychological state inconvenient consequences are ones that affect the sociopath for example id like to murder that person and i really dont care how it would affect them or their families but doing so would send me to prison so i guess i wont or more commonly sure its fun to manipulate people and completely destroy their relationships and sense of self respect but if i do it too much ill be outed and then wont have victims anymore so ill have to be way more subtle about it than id like people with antisocial personality disorder dont alter or control their behavior out of a genuine desire to minimize harm to others they do it to maintain power and influence and slip under the radar where they can continue to damage aspd is literally literally evil as a psychological diagnosis
ShitRedditSays,removed,from the way you speak it doesnt seem that you lack empathy at all a sociopath by definition cannot care about any of the things you do a sociopath cannot care whether other people suffer
ShitRedditSays,removed,unqueefing big time here incoming vulnerability im sorry to have offended you i didnt mean to imply that everyone with a mental illness was a sociopath i can see how that would be frustrating and hurtful and i apologize i too have mental illness ptsd is the most bothersome ive been diagnosed with panic disorder in the past but ive managed to get that under control im often profoundly suicidal though i dont talk about it much i think this is the first time ive mentioned it in months even counting therapy i dont like looking weak its a problem for me on the other hand i have had experience with a person that was diagnosed with aspd i was so wrapped around his finger that when he told me the diagnosis and asked if i thought it was correct i laughed and said the psych must be on drugs the joke was on me because he hurt me later in the relationship he is now locked away as he deserves but im rambling now sorry i guess what i mean to say is i do not think people on the autistic spectrum are sociopaths or that having a mental illness necessarily makes you one but i do know there are sociopaths out there i have trouble empathizing with them if that is problematic in itself im not sure how i would combat it i guess it would be something to bring up in therapy or something to educate myself on if i can bring myself to ill probably delete this post later maybe in a day i dont like showing anything but strength relating to my problems i will delete the other posts as well when i do it
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just saying that if gender dysphoria is a mental illness ostracizing transgender people is not the optimal solution
ShitRedditSays,removed,how come body dysmorphia is a mental illness but gender dysphoria isnt serious question as its hard to wade through the partisan articles on the internet to get to an answer
ShitRedditSays,removed,the amount of self awareness with your comment is incredible
ShitRedditSays,removed,so a bunch of people you know let you get raped no one said a word and let them drag you up the stairs and they described it as a handful of powder into everclear dude im sorry but none of this adds up and i dont buy it the way you describe it and crave validation from thus horrific story makes me think youre a straight up liar for karma disgusting
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sexually identify as an attack helicopter come at me landwhales
ShitRedditSays,removed,did i hurt your feefees
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop oppressing me shitlord
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am not from america what exactly is racist about this
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont do drugs kids they really let out the worst in you
ShitRedditSays,removed,does that percent not convicted refer to the who are prosecuted if so holy shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,so utrigglybot and uattackhelicopterbot were both shadowbanned two days in a row now the really offended redditor has created uantiheliphobebot the transphobic bot can be reported to admins using mod mail at rredditcom
ShitRedditSays,removed,god srs really is the cancer if reddit i wish you guys didnt have a little red light in my car
ShitRedditSays,removed,im touched yall strawman and misinterpret to support your victim narrative like none other bitchedaboutbythebest
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound fat
ShitRedditSays,removed,sup im the one that made the post linked here i was replying to a guy who said he needs to know if its okay to be attracted to a girl that looks underage i pointed out that hes being dumb because the age of the girl doesnt change whether or not hes attracted to her at least get your shit right before you criticize vote for trump build the wall keep the illegals out
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry bro did i invade your safe space or maybe i misgendered you by calling you bro
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry man my vidya isnt like your wife its not for others to use how is her boyfriends kid by the way omar jr must find it funny to have a dad that demands to be called mommy
ShitRedditSays,removed,as opposed to an sjw mastermind who puts years of her life into a womens studies degree then bitches about women in stem
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol youve stalked my entire history to find a month old comment so desperate
ShitRedditSays,removed,well who is
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a fun thread i like this thread apparently you guys dont know anything about the internet or shitstirring one little comment and three of you fucks start acirclejerkin but really you are all pretty gross people any expectation of a standard cannot be obtained in a place of anonymity and free speech please keep this thread jerkin
ShitRedditSays,removed,have no one taken biology classes humans have two genders male and female everything else is in your head i have no problem with that but saying there are more than two genders is incorrect
ShitRedditSays,removed,everything about that picture screamed not pleasant were we looking at the same photo
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty much its called a calorie deficit i understand you fat pigs cant understand that tho 😂
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is literally nothing which determines your weight other than genetics the stigma that fat people eat more is false and wont get true if you say it more
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit get a chinese wife footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,naw the blame falls fully to the redditor who observes the behaviour of the culture and has done a lot of traveling and expresses an informed opinion i know its not lovey dovey so its a reality that reddit is likely to reject
ShitRedditSays,removed,ever been to china spent a significant amount of time living in another culture and compared mannerisms
ShitRedditSays,removed,but chinese isnt a race its a nationality
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a white man kill all white men
ShitRedditSays,removed,i find this disgusting and alienating ive been jacking it to traps for years and im gen x
ShitRedditSays,removed,id argue that like most abused people its quite common for them to be we as humans are inclined to be attracted towards our abusers as it offers a sense of of hopeful release from the abuse its common among any sex gender and even amongst crosses species lines often enough
ShitRedditSays,removed,you dont have to defend a witty joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you sure jump to conclusions fast im new to srs and im seeing a lot of stuff i dont agree with am i allowed to respond to them or is this subreddit a circlejerk that doesnt allow other oppionions
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre called traps because originally at least people would post videos where it seems like a chick at first and then you realise its actually a guy
ShitRedditSays,removed,damn shes hot would bang
ShitRedditSays,removed,hitler did nothing wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,silence untermensch bow to my white greatness
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is false healthy food is everywhere and it is cheap very cheap rice is an example decent amount of calories good range of nutrients and really cheap oats is similar many vegetables are cheap like beans and packaged frozen vegetables they have good nutritional content and are cheap meat is where it gets more expensive but many supermarkets have specials on different meats so you have to merely look around chicken is not too expensive and if cooked properly can be nutrional and not too calorie dense pasta and fruit are also good choices that are not too epemsive and provide good nutrional content also water is free the resources are there but the education is not that is the problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,only the liberal ones but they are the bottom of the barrel of the white race me and all my buds are and up aryan gods do you think we should gas the subhuman hippie tatted druggies and fat fedora whites
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes youre right about the food bowls but what annoys me is the claim from the rest of the population who arent living in poverty claiming that healthy food is expensive this is what i mean by lack of education people with jobs and steady incomes and families dont even know what constitutes healthy food and how caloric intake affects weight
ShitRedditSays,removed,pc utopia where being white is akin to having commtted genocide
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs lurker here dont you think this ones a little how do i phrase this harmless
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats exactly what im talking about lack of education about what constitutes healthy and the price of this food in my original post i went over foods that are cheap and nutritious like rice oats vegetables i said meat wasnt always cheap but you can find it in some places although quality isnt too high it is cheap much more so than mcdonalds at least thats how it is in australia though i assume the price doesnt change too much there relatively although mcdonalds is cheaper education could also include how to use these cheap healthy resources to cook interesting meals the time factor is a very weak argument considering i can make good meals with these ingredients in minutes
ShitRedditSays,removed,and then goyim wonder why we dont like them im going to scream
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a toaster wanna hook up imagine our babies d
ShitRedditSays,removed,posting in rdrama instead of feminist cult subs reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is this is a reddit victim complex about how all rapists on sex offender lists are actually just innocent men falsely accused by the feminist prison industrial complex whose only real crime was doing the manly totally ok thing of pissing in public next to an elementary school on a saturday totally at like and not meaning anything by it totally
ShitRedditSays,removed,its also doing that thing where it brigades the linked thread and downvotes stuff super obviously i mean the jokes bieng downvoted are shitty and should be downvoted but its still pretty obviously you guys
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sexually identify as an overused sexually identification copypasta ever since i was a boy i dreamed of spamming other users with my unfunny wall of text people say to me that a person who does this is a laughable idiot and im fucking retarded but i dont care im beautiful im having these words glued all over my body from now on i want people to refer to me as an overused sexually identification copypasta as my preferred pronouns and respect my right to paste unfunny sexually identification copypastas to reddit in hope of receiving virtual internet points if you cant accept me youre funny and mentally stable and need to check your choice of subreddits thank you for being so understanding
ShitRedditSays,removed,like a major cause of the large amounts of obesity cases is the scarcity of healthy foods i gotta disagee w this cuss im all about valuable conversation and having it i know being from switzerland and not the center of the known universe american invalidates my opinion on the matter but i have gone on safari in the united states visiting the cultural wastelands and all healthy food was cheap it just required a small amount of time to cook compared to your dollar menu being very easy on the time department obesity is many faceted and i think a big culprit is time more than any laziness and lack of education that said in my country where we are not the center of the universe obv but the obesity rates here are miniscule and its not like we work less hours than our american counterparts we just as adults and as youths are taught to appreciate home cooked foods also all of our food is like more expensive than anything in america
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,white community leaders pretty sure anyone calling themselves that would labeled white supremacists instantly
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre fucking retarded
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get death threats from srs all the time but trump will win soon and make everything great again
ShitRedditSays,removed,you really only just learned that today its just words get the fuck over it
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not pissed off im laughing my tits off at all the delicate little princesses in this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,who said they were straight
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sexually identify as an apache helicopter respect my pronouns shitlords i am so triggered that i virtue signaled all day today on my tumblr
ShitRedditSays,removed,virtue signaling intensifies
ShitRedditSays,removed,this subreddit is autistic retarded and cancerous literally thought police i am a white nationalist national socialist traditionalist redpiller transphobe homophobe and a straight white male if you have xy chromosomes inside youre male if xx youre female if you dont you have a disabillity if you identify otherwise youre a retard if you transitioned youre an abomination come at me you jews
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a moronic comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,impressive and complex you must be looking at a different image
ShitRedditSays,removed,slavery was the obvious cause of secession in the first place why anyone would support its use is beyond me the southern states have perfectly good state flags if they want to express a wish to not be a part of the us anymore they are entitled to seek to secede if they feel that way they have to have support from of the people in the states that want to secede however
ShitRedditSays,removed,its disgusting how much of a pedo problem brown culture has between that and committing mass shootings bombings among other sick shit that brown people do the brown community leaders should really step up and hold their culture responsible
ShitRedditSays,removed,ever think that might also be because of disproportionate amounts of crimes committed by minorities
ShitRedditSays,removed,as someone who has depression and has had suicidal thoughts before i thought this was hilarious stop being a buzz kill i didnt know asa blackman suffered from depression too
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop being so melodramatic doesnt it get tiring after a while i can never tell if you guys are serious about this shit or just shitposting either way its annoying and i am a lesser person for even commenting
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was a swcc for years in the navy you simply cannot perform a quick and easy test for combat roles there is of course a standard pt minimum for timed run pushups pullups and so forth the minimum to start the buds pipeline doesnt seem difficult at first glance and im sure a large portion of females could perform equally as males on this minimum for example if someone was to just come out of boot camp and be required to do the minimum females would not be at a large disadvantage boot camp pt itself ensures that recruits can do this minimum both sexes would be fairly competitive but there is a much bigger picture to look at for one if someone is only able to do the minimum they will wash out period that number does not reflect what the actual requirements are to succeed for special operationssmall units like seal swcc ranger and so on the person who can only do the minimum is not the person for these communities and they simply wont be physically able to complete training two the instructors want to see performance much higher than the minimum after prolonged periods of stress exhaustion sleep deprivation caloric deficit and general abuse they want to see above average performance after stressing the trainees body for days or weeks this process takes time the student needs to demonstrate not that they can perform when rested and healthy but when pushed to their absolute limit its very common for students to pass out underwater while attempting some of the swim quals they get drug out turned on their side and eventually wake up gagging and coughing up water i passed out and failed my first try swimming the full lap underwater it was terrifying one minute i was swimming and really needed air the next i was coming to throwing up water and choking felt like i swallowed the entire pool this is just an example of what the instructors want to see and try to achieve with students better to pass out trying than come up for air and good that their training is pushing students to their limit im sure every branch of service that recruits for combat roles does similar training some more difficult some easier it is a fundamental lack of the big picture here that i am addressing woman are being allowed to attempt increasingly difficult roles in the military fine with me history teaches that some of the fiercest fighters of the vc in vietnam were female but the nature of war should dictate that testing should be absolutely equal for combat roles an injured person is not going to weigh any less because a female has to carry him or her an abort swim of several miles in the ocean after a fubared mission or operation wont become shorter to allow for equal performance the water will not become any warmer because politicians wanted to see females wearing the unit patch of course there are women capable of performing at this level but there is a problem politics has dictated that the graduation of females through these recently opened schools has become a priority even if they are actually not performing equally the women capable of these challenges have not arrived yet but the public and politicians demand results the last fiasco i heard of before separating occurred at ranger school two females passed the course making history they did not perform at the level required of men if they were men they would have washed out their graduation was set in stone when they arrived barring death or injury those two ladies were going to pass no matter what and they did this is not the way it should be this is not silicon valley and its not a heavily male office environment with a glass ceiling it does everyone who wears a ranger patch a disservice and it taints the future female candidates who show up ready to rock this is a dog and pony show meant to appease civilians and politicians this type of pandering gets service members killed as another example i can point to the female naval aviator revlon aka hulk stalled her fighter jet landing on carrier outside san diego it flipped over and the weapons officer pulled the eject handle too little to late he survived she hit the water literally being propelled by a rocket and died instantly she should not have passed training she had multiple failures that would have washed out a male candidate but she was going to be the first female fighter jet aviator and that was decided before she even arrived for training the navy was desperate to appear progressive and interested in equality fighter pilot is the sexiest career and possibly the pinnacle of military service they needed a female in that uniform to parade around and they killed her a fine service member capable of just about any job was killed because politics dictated the navy needed a female fighter aviator of course in due time females showed up ready to rock and passed legit there are now many females in that role and they are fucking good at it it has to occur organically and the students must perform equally despite their sex only a fraction of military jobs have requirements that make it rarer for women to succeed based on physiological differences but they exist there is no quick and easy test for these roles the training is very expensive very time consuming and can be very dangerous pretending otherwise to suit a political agenda or to satisfy individual beliefs that men and women are equal in every way is really not a good idea the biggest hurdle i see for women filling advanced combat roles is simple if a female is capable physically of completing a top tier combat training program equal to a male they dont join the military they use that exceptional physical capability in more lucrative careers they become world champion downhill skiers track and field stars soccer players the talent and capability is there but by the time they hit they are already on track to succeed as a civilian the problem isnt that women cannot train equally to fill a billet the problem is that the ones who can are already on the path to success in athletics before they reach enlistment age or they succeed in college sports and continue that career once they graduate instead of joining the officer corps this puts the military in a bind as various presidential administrations demand female faces in these roles middle management knows how dangerous it is lower ranks know even the very top brass know deep down but they become top brass because they are political figures more than military the political agenda takes precedence over their own service members which i find absolutely repulsive i would sooner be forced to retire or passed up for promotion than risk a students life or the lives of other service members so a president can add a few lines to a speech name dropping this fine student who is making history as the first x in whatever school sickening and one of the many reasons i did not see myself making a career out of it if you would like a visual representation of what i have mentioned there is an excellent documentary on youtube following class through the navy seal training pipeline it may be a bit colder and wetter than ranger school but the general premise is the same physical performance isnt tested once its tested for weeks or months every single day i appreciate your stance on this subject and i am not in disagreement with you i just felt that passing on my own experience and opinion would contribute to the conversation
ShitRedditSays,removed,i managed to jerk off to this a couple fo thoughts these guys are really truly delusional the sort of magical powers they give srs reminds me of how they attributed superhuman power to anita sarkeesian second you believe subs like rnews rworldnews are filtered and censored to fit in with sjw beliefs you are more delusional than i thought they virtually openly nazi subreddits nice work copying and pasting paragraphs too many times doxxing of cwm i havent seen any evidence for that but the word of frankly i would consider trying to track down the identity of an unconvicted serial rapist a pretty reasonable reaosn for doxxing
ShitRedditSays,removed,rape threats rape threats rape threats rape threats rape threats rape threats rape threats rape threats rape threats v
ShitRedditSays,removed,i honestly think this guy had scizophrenia
ShitRedditSays,removed,good god you post history how lonely and virgin are you
ShitRedditSays,removed,faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,it gets better too in the last hour or two he posted stuff about srs in prime meta the mailbag ragainstmensrights andrwritingprompts i think op needs some professional help
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree with you i think that the fact that srs cant even admit that they arent right of the time is ridiculous yes this is probably the most socially progressive sub on reddit but that doesnt give us a license to do whatever we want dismissing legitimate criticism as reactionary tears is fucking stupid there is a doxxing problem coming from srs and it needs to be dealt with
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i was gonna say it would make a great book title the confederate states of america attention whores racists and shitbags
ShitRedditSays,removed,what does this have to do with gender maybe you should explore other subreddits unrelated to drama because in general people dont talk about suicide
ShitRedditSays,removed,does that guy do nothing but bitch about women on reddit all day everyday
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats rule x again
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is better than getting gilded
ShitRedditSays,removed,i miss rodney dangerfield and his comedy and i wasnt ever rrally a big fan not sure why this post reminded me of that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think this is just a harmless joke just my opinion though
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is no wage gap
ShitRedditSays,removed,doesnt exist proves to the point in the op what else
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah to be honest you would be a shitty policeman in the event anything got physical you might be able to be csi or a detective but youre going to get beat up gun stolen or worse the violent guy youre trying to arrest on assault charges will knock you out and run away im only and you couldnt do anything to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,ought to be a huge source of embarrassment for every male gamer and should immediately ruin any enjoyment they can get out of playing online na fuck you
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay i understand that people feel they are in the wrong body and that their gender they were originally assigned with isnt who they really are that makes sense to me but ive never been able to understand gender fluidity how can ones gender switch from female to male or androgynous
ShitRedditSays,removed,youve gotta be pretty warped mentally to think that the attack helicopter meme is making fun of trans people maybe you realize that the extremist pansexual demigenderfluid dragonkin are indefensible so you fall back to pretending to be offended that the meme is attacking people with legitimate gender dysphoria
ShitRedditSays,removed,dota is mostly played by russians and i cant imagine a group who would more openly laugh at and mock your sjw bullshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant be responsible for every single person in the world who uses a copypasta and your counterexample wouldnt prove anything anyways i can show you examples of it being not used to target trans people which still wouldnt prove anything anyways its pretty clear that its making fun of people who identify as a completely nonexistant gender apache attack helicopter am i surprised that you conflated a ridiculous meme as trans hate not at all theres a reason you hang out on this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,no sexism can only be applied by those in power to those that they oppress the patriarchy doesnt give women power therefore theyre not in a privileged enough position to be sexist meanerwhile men hold power in society and can be sexist but cant be victims of sexism do you actually believe this
ShitRedditSays,removed,sigh
ShitRedditSays,removed,why
ShitRedditSays,removed,i reread it times and i still dont understand
ShitRedditSays,removed,boys are stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you think men are inferior to women
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay that clears that up then thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,do they like acting this stupid or b are they just stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow this is one of the most sexist things ive read in awhile i dont understand how you can possible believe that its really disgusting ill probably get banned from this subreddit for this post buy as long as this pops up in your inbox this person offended me better insult an entire half of the human race doesnt make sense at all fuck you
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is a song about how he is a product of rape pretty sad actually
ShitRedditSays,removed,hard to say if his story was true or not but lets just say it is finding out youre the product of rape probably isnt easy its interesting to watch somebody whos using humor to overcome their situation get yelled at by somebody who cant what the fuck being the product of rape isnt the fucking same as being raped there is nothing to overcome
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love this sub i dont really agree with the motives you guys have for making your posts but this sub does a great job of aggregating posts for laughs
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes sorry for raping someone hell be sorry when he gets castrated
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck everyone here who isnt doing this ironically or for the meme this whole subreddit is the definition of the terms gay and cancerous
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know it was a woman that first said that right obvi not you ignorant sexist pigm
ShitRedditSays,removed,that was mildly humorous mostly stupid are you losers really offended over that
ShitRedditSays,removed,for people that make fun of people for being easily triggered this headphone debacle sure has done a number on them
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would just like to thank you rshitredditsays for becoming rbestof for mildly offensive humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am literally oppressed by him saying that oh sorry i meant them cant be assuming genders round here can we
ShitRedditSays,removed,not sure if we should use the word deranged in a derogatory manner like that seems kind of ableist
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty accurate sorry to interrupt the furious circle jerk
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i think the parody would be from people like httpsyoutubefenjfzwczs notice how shes screaming about being abused while insulting everyone around her who are trying to get her to calm down this is what i would think would be the thing people parody

ShitRedditSays,removed,if you let that decide wether you read it or not is a shame he rapes casca to torture guts who he believes is the reason everything happens to him the child resulting from the rape also has a big impact on the story it was a shocking scene but it wasnt rape just for rapes sake

ShitRedditSays,removed,yall are fucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,yup always having to pay taxes for everyone elses welfare
ShitRedditSays,removed,we seriously need laws to prevent shit getting out of the bag so fast in the age of social media criminal accusations should be business of the police with social media these things go viral immediately and people start talking out of their asses about how the alleged victim is probably doing it for attention
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this not a valid thing to say beating the shit out of people who disagree with you at rallies is bad

ShitRedditSays,removed,most black comedians is a bit generalizing but the user is on point with those that use their race as their entire comedy bit its extremely stale and gets old really fast
ShitRedditSays,removed,its pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean its no sara silverman queef joke but its not bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realize that this was a joke about the lions sucking and not about racism right

ShitRedditSays,removed,i guess i underestimated your ignorance uwhydomenexist hmmm
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes right tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,im the guy that wrote that comment english isnt my native language so the comment i wrote might have been constructed in a way unorthodox or conveys another meaning that i didnt intend it to give im neutral and unbiased on this whole thing i tried to explain the situation from a progamergate perspective since the person asking only received the antigamergate side of it as contained within the article me looking at this thread makes a good case for horseshoe theory though this place reminds me of something like rtheredpill only on the other extreme end not everyone trying to argue one side of the coin is inherently trying to silence or deconstruct the other side thank you also hate comments and pm threats are welcome i actually like to things like those it gives me more insight to how certain people think
ShitRedditSays,removed,i seriously fucking hope you never breed i like too much to see it overrun by a bunch of stupid cnts

ShitRedditSays,removed,randomly hating conventionally attractive women is by and large something done by men but only if they dont want to have sex with disgusting neckbeards which is almost all of them
ShitRedditSays,removed,well it was between someone who allegedly abused people and someone who allegedly threatened abused people not exactly the greatest crop
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds like he has a good sense of humour for a gook
ShitRedditSays,removed,turned out to be true though apparently he came to germany as a refugee as well
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahhahaha its because you literally titled your subject mods white supremacists please keep on not learning from your mistakes the popcorn tastes too good
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahah keep reporting you fucking loser
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can leave any time you want 👋🏾
ShitRedditSays,removed,since im into semantics the definition actually does refer to men explaining things to women httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimansplaining though admittedly it also says it usually which means not always again semantics is about the explainee explaining to someone who knows more than the explainee
ShitRedditSays,removed,so is mansplaining just your ilks excuse when you cant actually make a rebuttal
ShitRedditSays,removed,calls you an ism word check guarantees they are smarter than you check doesnt respond to the argument check keep on being you you losers will eat yourselves alive fighting about whos the most victimized anyways thanks for helping republicans have more control than theyve had in years
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol seriously its a novelty account
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you seriously trying to mansplain to us what hes doing
ShitRedditSays,removed,the fact that you assume that a man posted that is extremely sexist for shame gump for shame
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is your proposition the realpolitik of the left is building a coalition of the oppressed and that includes those marginalized by their class abandoning their struggle because theyve been conned due to a lack of education isnt morally righteous how are you going to get the useful idiots a part of your voting coalition without legitimizing their also very real struggle as working class and poor people this is the group that rejected democrats this year more than any other demographic based on exit polling compared to and obviously the coalition of identity politics didnt win this year and identity politics absolutely matter in conjunction with politics of economics and from this comment it seems you care about results too so how do you want to manipulate them with a platform that relies solely on social issues that you posit they dont care about because theyre incapable of being woke which i also fully reject these people are not actively evil they just arent educated educated people that still support an ideology rooted in oppression yeah fuck them
ShitRedditSays,removed,when the hell did this become an sjw infested sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,a true hero
ShitRedditSays,removed,he finally broke out of the leftist brainwashing doublespeak safe space tumblr sjw communist lamestream echo chamber good for him
ShitRedditSays,removed,honest question how do you want to proceed with these competitions should there be competitions for just men and just women if so how should these competitions decree what is a woman and what is a man purely biological should it be defined by the social construct of woman supposing one supports singlesex competitions not saying you do then that person should define what it means to be what gender a mtf trans would not be allowed to compete in a womens cycling event if woman was defined biologically that trans person could compete if woman was defined as a set of social behaviors he identifies as a woman and thus would be allowed to compete again how should this situation be handled
ShitRedditSays,removed,rtimestop nsfw by the way
ShitRedditSays,removed,they were making jokes about prison rape but no one on this sub points that out its not rape if its in prison this is actually rape culture
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres no victim blaming here if you have unprotected sex you are running the risk of having a child if you take that risk you damn well get to live with the consequences
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is alright i dont see anything wrong with this comment many people are able to have fun banter
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think many would its just inconvenient to do when it is socially unacceptable and when different bodyparts are hard to access due to layers of clothing and so on there are many who do take the opportunity whenever they think they can get away with it i have been to parties where apparently a girl passed out and a guy used the oppurtunity because its easily assessible to move aside the underwear and he only got caught by random chance because he did not undress her apart from moving the underwear to the side or anything if he had just moved away when people approached then nobody would be none the wiser about it just a girl sleeping and a boy doing whatever its not like we were muslims who wont let unmarried people be alone with each other so people do actually grab tits and pussies when they think they get away with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,their sarcasm was pretty obvious tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean this whole thread kinda smells of it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was being sarcastic its ironic that no one cares
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was obviously being sarcastic jesus op cares more about bigots making fun of another races genitals than the jokes about prison rape why wasnt that the thing they were outraged over both are bad but ones pretty violent
ShitRedditSays,removed,woah language im pointing out the illogicinherent contradiction of the whole wanting women to sleep with you but wanting virgins thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,it seems as though the student is fine with it he is saying it in a pretty lighthearted tone so im pretty sure its just banter
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats the complaint really
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,judging people by their sense of humour is always the way to go
ShitRedditSays,removed,my expectations were confounded and from thence the humour arose
ShitRedditSays,removed,by me personally and my russian bots
ShitRedditSays,removed,forcing
ShitRedditSays,removed,the wage gap is not real the fact that people still claim it is after constant refutation is embarrassing
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah you can have dark humour and still be a nice person
ShitRedditSays,removed,cry more please
ShitRedditSays,removed,abusing your girlfriend is hilarious
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is mansplaining tldr
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is sarcasm what is joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,im white and i dont agree with this persons point of view by any stretch of the imagination but obviously there are black people who hate white people in fact racism against whites is as big of an issue as racism against blacks not bigger alllivesmatter
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is it racism to call someone black
ShitRedditSays,removed,someone needs to start rshitredditgetsupsetat and make this joke of a post that showed up on my rall the first submission
ShitRedditSays,removed,i usually agree with submissions on this sub but this person is actually right if there is institutional racism which there probably isnt if anybody is slightly disadvantaged by it its heterosexual white males
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair it is just as bad granted i didnt say just as common but both are not okay and not progressive
ShitRedditSays,removed,gtfo
ShitRedditSays,removed,of course you have to make something up to ridicule me otherwise youd have to actually not say dumb shit for once
ShitRedditSays,removed,well said
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet bucks this guys a virgin
ShitRedditSays,removed,mansplaining doesnt exist
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree stop femsplaining
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean its a good point islam is fundamentally flawed and directly or indirectly puts a lot of people through grief it should be criticized the problem is that they referred to it as cancer which is just silly
ShitRedditSays,removed,the difference is that most muslims in the middle east are practicing and traditional so saudi arabia is a fairly accurate representation of many christians in the west are thankfully secular or borderline atheist and dont take their religion so seriously the bible teaches that gays should be oppressed or put to death that it is an abomination ask a typical christian if they believe this and they will respond with a vehement no the quran teaches that nonbelievers should be forcefully converted or otherwise segregated against ask a typical muslim if they believe this and they will agree in some capacity of course it is bad to put generalizations onto everyone and no one person should be judged because of their religion because were all different its just important to address the point
ShitRedditSays,removed,that comment alone isnt that bad i mean when people take pictures like this its pretty obvious the intention is to get attention pretty transparent within the bounds of normal to get irked by that and point it out whats not okay is the sexism that follows in other comments women might do this more but both genders definitely do it
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a shitty mindset a lot of black people probably say all these stupid fucking white people being racist and thats part of the reason they become racist and then the white person here does the same thing and its a vicious cycle someone being racist is not an excuse for you to be racist be the bigger person
ShitRedditSays,removed,learn to take a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,disgusting in any event this was removed for being lowhanging fruit but i did not see it on the list please add it
ShitRedditSays,removed,well it takes two to tango
ShitRedditSays,removed,the way i see it opinion is that we should forget about the past and see each other as we are human beings regardless of race black people were kept as slaves but we shouldnt even be saying black people we should be saying people were kept as slaves because regardless of race they were humans and we should all feel for the struggle of humans rant
ShitRedditSays,removed,the way i see it if you like a girl you should make that clear from day this doesnt mean you be awkward and right out say i like you but you have to flirt and make it clear that youre a person who is down for a physical relationship
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres clusters of rightwing fucks theres clusters of leftwing fucks theres clusters of people who dont care fucks theres clusters of centrist fucks youll find a place for you on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,both white and black people can be racist when white people are racist it can cause black people to become cynical then when black people are racist it can cause white people to feel the same why its a shitty cycle and in the end it takes two to tango blaming one side is ineffective
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry i should have specified i was talking about muslims in countries like saudi arabia iraq jordan western muslims usually share the secularism of other religions in the west
ShitRedditSays,removed,its very possible for a woman to become pregnant without the mans consent does she have to take responsibility for her vagina
ShitRedditSays,removed,id like to believe that an educated mentallystable christian individual in any of those countries would reject those beliefs unfortunately most people in subsaharan and central africa are not educated and stick to the word of their holy book the difference in islam is even those who are educated adhere to their religion very staunchly even in the face of science though personally id prefer if we just got rid of religion in general but thats my own personal view
ShitRedditSays,removed,racism should be taken on a casebycase basis if racism occurs institutional or otherwise the perpetrator should be dealt with appropriately we should be vigilant in looking for acts of racism this does not mean we have to apply broad labels that can falsely stereotype groups of people
ShitRedditSays,removed,psst lets all go shoot fascists
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a novelty account being satirical youre the real joke here op
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are you desperate for karma you must have read the bit where he says the women in the photos gave him permission
ShitRedditSays,removed,why on earth would you want to take away such an integral part of democracy the real shame is so many people have let their governments take away their right to self defense and self determination
ShitRedditSays,removed,can anyone explain to me why this is bad looks just like a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah but its just a joke do terrist jokes nornalise terrorism
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok ok i get it rape jokes bad but what if its a really funny joke tgen its ok right
ShitRedditSays,removed,also trusting the government with anything is idiotic as they wish only to prolong their rule nothing else the only sensible option is anarchism fite me irl
ShitRedditSays,removed,perhaps something more intimidating that skinny jeans next time though the picture seems to be drawing mocking derision outside of leftist subs
ShitRedditSays,removed,come on thats gotta be a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can get aids from queueing
ShitRedditSays,removed,transpeople are called such because theyre transitioning to people
ShitRedditSays,removed,huh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i feel the same way believe me but there may be people who feel like multiple sets of pronouns may work for them or people who dont particular care which pronouns are used but who pick a set for the sake of simplicity i was trying to be inclusive those individuals and just couldnt think of a better word choice
ShitRedditSays,removed,and then punch em in the dick
ShitRedditSays,removed,for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes they do there are general traits that people from various areas tend to conform to these are often down to cultural influences and are nothing to do with racism stereotypes like germans are efficient something which most germans would not only agree with but be rather proud of and that nigerians are a bit argumentative and always try to bargain prices down something i have experienced time and time again are not racist they are generalisations and should be treated as such not hard as fast rules but a general idea of what any given group of people can be like for these stereotypes to be racist the statement would have to be maliciously applied with the intent to harm hurt or belittle if we continue to get oversensive see another generalisation which this time includes me even though im not one if the over sensitive ones and im not whining about every phrase which could possibly be construed as racist or offensive we will soon be completely mute save for the occasional very polite hello
ShitRedditSays,removed,every stereotype has a grain of truth now i am not saying stereotypes are good by any means i am just going to point out and try to sympathize with what i think this guy is trying to say what is think he is trying to say is that there is a source behind stereotypes and that maybe not a majority of the race but part of the race fits that stereotype and thats where it comes from now my high school was full of walking stereotypes because we had a really diverse and accepting community and it was a new england prep school so every asian was very good at math all the black boys played on the basketball team and all the white people could never dance at dances and were all rich kids that wore stereotypical preppy shit though everyone wore preppy shit because that was the dress code there were the potheads and the feminists the jocks and the nerds the smart kids and the dumb kids but you know what we all got along my class had all these groups and we were only a class of just over students
ShitRedditSays,removed,he said racial stereotypes that includes white stereotypes correct kinda like the white stereotype that all white people are privileged racists
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i have always said myself racial stereotypes exist for a reason
ShitRedditSays,removed,im new to this is everyone aware theyre saying stuff like this for a quick laugh or do you actually think theyre psychopaths
ShitRedditSays,removed,you have a very blinkered vision of an entire continent
ShitRedditSays,removed,its amazing how chickenshit racists are and how many of them try and dance around not wanting to own their racism these are the people who rant and rave about masculinity and machismo and they cant even fess up to what they really believe in they are the ultimate cowards
ShitRedditSays,removed,internet edgelords are more frequently triggered than any feminist has ever been
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh yeah i know theyre obviously just trying to get a quick easy laugh though
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is an ass rant
ShitRedditSays,removed,you successfully triggered women into never having sex with you ever in your entire life way to go loser
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha autism right theyre so stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,jeez you guys are really stuck up pricks their are so many fucking warnings that if you click that shit and claim it was an accident then you are likely autistic if reddit likes it enough to vote it up to the front page then why remove it its a funny site and if you dont wanna see the effects then dont click
ShitRedditSays,removed,white liberal ass feminism
ShitRedditSays,removed,the more i stay alive the more i feel like of cis white males deserve to die
ShitRedditSays,removed,cuck gay autist xd xd am i edgy now guys xd
ShitRedditSays,removed,kek
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe because people over there understand what a joke is
ShitRedditSays,removed,the original commenter should be sterilized and locked in a small hole for the rest of his life being left to feed on the moss that grows down there with him
ShitRedditSays,removed,feeeemale you misspelled criminal
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes it is a joke that people find funny you may not find it funny why do you have to ruin their fun
ShitRedditSays,removed,bernie said white people cant be poor according to this guy this is racisme and nothing elsemaybe not as destructive as donalds racisme but still rasicme
ShitRedditSays,removed,assuming something about a few people from ethnic group and thinking it applies to the whole ethnic group doesnt matter which one is racist since bernie assumed all white people dont know what its like to experience being poor this means that he was racist because saying all of the homeless people wich are often veterans and people that got fucked by capatalism that are white dont know what its like to be poor is ignorant i know that more black people are poor but you dont fight racisme with racisme because it leads to more racisme
ShitRedditSays,removed,no its caused by really shitty decisions women make and continue to make even though society tries to insulate them from any sense of responsibility or accountability
ShitRedditSays,removed,yet here we are in srs arguing about it in your post who is the one actually offended its astounding to see your double standard here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love when you self satirize
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a mother fucker i recommend fucking their mothers
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you are going to emigrate you must emigrate legally
ShitRedditSays,removed,how else are you going to get change to happen in your community who asked you to
ShitRedditSays,removed,nerds always deserved it
ShitRedditSays,removed,cis means legitimate in my language
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not even a term though its literally the same word gay people use to identify with its being so incredibly soft skinned and reaching really far to make the case that the gays is derogatory or exclusive
ShitRedditSays,removed,anyone that sires or births a redditor should have themselves sterilized actually we should just sterilize all the whites
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant believe how petty people are says the idiot commenting in srs total lack of selfawareness much
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont get what the big deal is its a dumb picture with a dumb comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,i find it ironic because on a post about how bad censorship is this le edgy user still found the need to censor their horribly offensive slur gee i wonder why actually no i dont because im a redditor and self reflection is for cucks also if he had used the real slur without censorship it probably wouldve been downvoted
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a bit cheating going to rshitpost
ShitRedditSays,removed,im new to this sub can someone explain to me whats wrong with the comment being discussed
ShitRedditSays,removed,go fuck yourself cuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,qualifications to run subs at once low selfesteem lack of any goals bad health bad hygiene less than contacts on your phone and living with your momgrandma optional
ShitRedditSays,removed,tanisha is a real name though ie httpsenwikipediaorgwikitanishathomas
ShitRedditSays,removed,while both are technically true the men example isnt the best comparison it invites potential attacks on the credibility of other arguments due to the prevalence of various logical fallacies
ShitRedditSays,removed,newage censorship if we censor the new agers how ever will we know what crystals can realign our chakras to help us poop sunshine
ShitRedditSays,removed,about months ago i got broken up with by i girl i was dating for years i really loved her and hurt a ton she was my first real girlfriend and a high school sweetheart type deal so it was really hard to move on im a freshman in college now and about two months ago i finally started to get over her just spent the last month with an incredible new girl and finally started to feel amazing againonly to find out today that she thinks shes fully gay and not bisexual and that we cant be together romantically i get that its not her fault and that theres nothing i can really do to change what happened but it still hurts the same i was finally back on my feet and now im back to square one this shit sucks so much we still agreed to be friends and it was only a month but wow this hurts just as bad as the first time
ShitRedditSays,removed,jfc reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,all these people talking about partners falling asleep during sex and never thought hey maybe having sex with someone literally passing out is fucked up
ShitRedditSays,removed,justmarriedthings yeah just like any healthy married couple remember the date rape doesnt have to stop with the ring s
ShitRedditSays,removed,the bot they hurt the bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbf my husband and i would be totally fine with this arrangement i mean intercourse has stopped at that point plus we dont always ask to touch each others butts lol maybe they have a similar understanding its not like he said he kept going
ShitRedditSays,removed,its said that my first thought was along the lines of at least he stops penetration pretty mild for reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant even joke about thisthis is just disgusting and i dont want to hear any freedom of speech bullcraphe said it so i also have a right to be disgusted
ShitRedditSays,removed,i guess ill say the thing youre not supposed to say here men are an unconnected group of people who happen to share the same gender islam is a concrete set of beliefs and doctrines no one is killing queer people because theyre a man the same cant be said for islam
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao you are a cuck rarbearokc
ShitRedditSays,removed,idk this isnt weird to me at all i think it depends on the relationship you have with your so my boyfriend and i do shit like this all the time and its no big deal
ShitRedditSays,removed,or just evict them from the land of the living a knife costs less than rocket fuel
ShitRedditSays,removed,not to mention all that money his family apparently spent to immigrate when youre seeking refuge after your country is fucking levelled re syria you shouldnt have to spend your life savings to survive and thats assuming youve got savings
ShitRedditSays,removed,can we not call human beings illegals
ShitRedditSays,removed,you think it was bullies who built the railroads and infrastructure in africa what little is good in africa today is because of the west china is currently filling the vacuum though will be interesting
ShitRedditSays,removed,where are those lynched black people at
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats just entirely false
ShitRedditSays,removed,the irony of this comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck off you piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck off you sack of shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,no whites whoa a bit too far no
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do white people no culture
ShitRedditSays,removed,kinda like you people blame whitesmenthe patriarchy for your problems banned for disagreeing
ShitRedditSays,removed,i give you props for selfawareness a rare find on srs for sure keep on keeping on as the great joe dirt once said
ShitRedditSays,removed,treats women like subhumans throws homosexuals off buildings genitally mutilates their children murders dissidents and protesters doesnt allow for questioning of government or authority what about this isnt backwards its deluded of libshits like you to defend the actions of people who are the antithesis of what you stand for the cognitive dissonance is absolutely astounding our society is beautiful because we allow the freedom of all peoples to live their lives how they want we have laws and institutions in place which means you wont get murdered for your sexuality or political opinions the fact you can even sit here and complain about it is a freedom offered to you by your society these people are fleeing their backwards ass medieval cultures because they are horrible if they liked it so much why not just stay and yet when they arrive here they try to import their backwards ideology and we being so accepting and inclusive allow them to do so they are ruining the very foundation of what makes us an attractive place to immigrate to in the first place i thought id use up my one srs comment on a funny troll comment or dank meme or whatever but i couldnt let this one slide the fact tolerant people like yourself are defending blatant intolerance is appallingly frustrating if a white man behaved in the same way as these muslims you would lynch him yet all he needs to do is say well its my religion so you should respect that and suddenly its aok this is why rightwing sentiment and xenophobia is rising all across the world this is why brexit and trump happened because the average person is waking up to the fact that your rhetoric is disingenuous traitorous and vindictive you are putting the freedoms and values of child raping women beating gaybashers over your neighbours and fellow countrymen who do none of these things and telling us we should suck it up and accept them too fuck astounding hypocrisy im so glad the common person has finally caught on im so glad you guys are finally losing your ideology will be dead within the decade but how many more terrorist attacks or massrapes are going to have to happen before people like you finally get the hint how many innocent people are going to have get hurt before you finally realise these people are not offering you the same friendship and acceptance you are extending to them we should not be tolerating intolerance
ShitRedditSays,removed,when you threaten violence against violent racists youre just as bad as those threatening violence against people because of their skin color tip to offended people murdering someone for their voluntary creed is a lot different than committing violence against someone for their genetic makeup
ShitRedditSays,removed,white people have less culture than yogurt what about our literature ie shakespeare the various types of architecture invented in the west philosophical schools of thought and folk music is that not culture
ShitRedditSays,removed,let me start off by saying that in the context of the developed western world you are absolutely right and that the gender wage gap is one of those well known and proven things we can even find extreme examples of it in other less feminist countries now im going to explore some parts of the world where the kind of arbitrage sexist individuals claim should automatically exist while ignoring that competition a currently restrained force in the western world due to a lack of trust busting is what drives arbitrage and that bigotry brings with it utility that can easily outweigh the wage premiums additional cost actually does exist mostly because the interaction of feminism and globalism is an interesting topic white people or at least foreign multinationals were actually hiring women preferentially in south korea and japan where women are heavily discriminated against in the workplace but not or at least not nearly so much in education in south korea it appears to be a pure wage play but in japan according to japanese hr execs the women are more aggressive according to sakie fukushima a director of another business lobby keizai doyukai humanresources executives say in private that they would hire young women ahead of men most of the time yet they are afraid that they will lose them when they have children japans female now tend to be far more internationally minded than their male equivalents says lawsons mr niinami they outperform soshoku danshi or herbivore men socalled for taking lowresponsibility jobs and preferring shopping to sex these same young men have little desire to follow the breadwinnerhousewife model adopted by their parents indeed japanese media have recently with some surprise begun to note a trend towards young fathers taking on more child care this article on saudi arabia tells a similar story but im linking it for a more hilarious reason fewer men are happy to come home to their wife with her feet up says khalid alkhudair founder of glowork a company that runs a website to connect women and employers and then they will get annoyed at having to drive her everywhere apparently nothing turns a lazy man feminist like seeing his wife dick around all day because she is legally prevented from working theres similar stuff about women being preferentially hired for factory jobs in the middle east because their work ethic hasnt been damaged by generations of no show government make work jobs and because the best women are prevented from taking jobs commiserate with their talents by sexism in other articles but i have to get started doing you know work shit today i guess what i hoped to achieve with this post is to show the surprising differences that exist in the world now for a brief response to the bigots standard claim of bigotry arbitrage its important to remember that economic arguments about bigotry must always account for the reality that bigots derive utility from discrimination and are therefore willing to accept paying a premium to achieve their bigoted desires so while a nonbigoted person would snap up a qualified women who is criminally underpaid a bigot would prefer to hire someone that fits their world view so long as the premium doesnt exceed the utility they derive from discrimination thats why we need laws and strong enforcement to impose an additional and more substantial penalty than the economic one on bigotry hope that was interesting and i really need to stop dicking around
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow i have been bouncing between thedonald and srs all day and i have to say you guys are pretty entertaining you guys are pretty much the same batshit crazy all around keep it up this is really going somewhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you read mans search for meaning by viktor e frankl you would read him describing the slave labor he and his coworkers did while twigs i know you mean well but youre hurting reality when you posture about what you dont know
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not the joke good try
ShitRedditSays,removed,basic reading comprehension
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a pizzeria in dc that uses the symbols for pedophiles on its menus and has some other creepy art going on people have tried to connect this to global childtrafficking networks and to the clinton campaign a lot of this stems from podestas brother being an actualy pedophile and the spirit cooking references in the wikileaks emails
ShitRedditSays,removed,brigading is mass downvoting on any post from a sub or because its posted in other places of reddit when that was not against the rules srs did it now thay its against the rules we dont but white boys still do it to us and the mods dont give a shit reddit accuses us of still being a downvote brigade when we are almost always the ones being mass downvoted hence srs is brigading itself again
ShitRedditSays,removed,and
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not hard to feel superior to people who hang out at the donald or srs i think anyone who feels down in life should just come here or the donald and they will be all like shit at least im not like any of them you guys give pathetic a new definition conspiracy theorists haters self haters and just plain loony toons good job making others feel better about themselves you guys deserve a medal
ShitRedditSays,removed,no my feels are not hurt quite the opposite i feel entertained so please keep this up its fun to read whats going on on the inside of peoples heads this shit is just hilarious
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre one of those people whos like professionally offended arent you just permanently aghast at everyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,so youre a racist rstormfrontorsjw
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a communist who hates trump as much as anyone else but they actually had some good evidence going on
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hate that im actually having to explain this but many people find humor in wordplay when the first guy said straight avocado we all knew he meant just eating a plain avocado the next guy comes in and suggests that the first guy is using a different usage of the word straight this is a fairly common comedic tool
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol or making fun of people who constantly say stuff like that speak for yourself i am gay and the only thing that offends me is people trying to speak for me based on something as arbitrary as a personal preference
ShitRedditSays,removed,would you give me one pic shot to make you suspicious enough to put on that tinfoil hat
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not who you were talking to but ill bite its a play on words the original comment used straight to mean alone the comment in question played on that word to mean sexual orientation wordplay is a staple of comedy httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwordplay
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt going to end well if we dont start listening to one another
ShitRedditSays,removed,arent you guys at least a bit selfaware and embarrassed that you got donald trump elected because you started bullying a bunch of gamers of all people how pathetic is that im not a gamer anymore and wasnt at the time i kind of looked into this whole ordeal about a year ago and im definitely not a republican and find trump genuinely scary but i have to admit that the one silverlining that you poisonous sjws got btfo is just the tiniest bit satisfying
ShitRedditSays,removed,because its just a silly how poking fun at people who respond to a captioned picture of some kid and say did you just assume their gender it had nothing to do with making fun of gay people especially since the joke doesnt even refer to gay people but trans
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats clearly not what they were suggesting it sounded like a very standard identitarian statement to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you know what a joke is
ShitRedditSays,removed,what does this have to do with gay people
ShitRedditSays,removed,so is the point of the comment section in this sub to ironically type shitty reddit comments would downvotes just upvotes im realising as i type this im logically participating
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think ive ever met a trans person who doesnt disclose their status before having sex with someone as one of my friends said not doing so is a good way to get murdered
ShitRedditSays,removed,americans just take everything and then blow it up yeah like the middle east i know the way out
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre using the classical definition of liberal not the one used to describe democrats
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre
ShitRedditSays,removed,this person isnt actual stating that they believe this viewpoint theyre just stating its what holocaust deniers believe why are you all getting upset about this
ShitRedditSays,removed,try telling that to my english professor ha
ShitRedditSays,removed,probably because they know what the actual definition of facism is trump is an egomaniac and a piece of shit but that doesnt make him a fascist
ShitRedditSays,removed,so his opinion is that its wrong for a trans person to not disclose there birth sex before intercourse or am i misunderstanding
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub is fuckin hilarious please ben me
ShitRedditSays,removed,i regularly take shits that are more relevant than this sub mmuh bens farts
ShitRedditSays,removed,no bb i am sad
ShitRedditSays,removed,basically hes not making an unfair point he just says it in a really unfair way due to his own issues with feminism hes basically saying its a form of rape for a transgendered person to have sex with you and not reveal theyre transgender ergo taking away your ability to consent
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh come on you really cant see the dishonesty involved straight men are not bigots for not being attracted to penis this logic is what creates transphobia
ShitRedditSays,removed,not to everyone but they at least should tell their sexual partners before they sleep with them because were living in a world where this fact might change somebodys consent if they knew the person was trans lets be honest genitalia is a huge deal for most people in this society its by no means ideal but given how our society is today it would be ethically and morally wrong in my personal opionion to not be completely honest with your sexual partner before you hop under the covers its a sensitive topic and i know that its debated even in the trans community with people on both sides of the fence
ShitRedditSays,removed,so i take it youre against homosexuality and consider it a form of bigotry since gay men dont like vagina and lesbians dont like penis that makes you the asshole for being a homophobe
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is it a strawman people are literally saying it is transphobic if youre a straight male who has a problem dating a preop transwoman without your knowledge
ShitRedditSays,removed,but he consented what the fuck is the problem he even said hes okay with it its like saying that its ok that she got roofied or raped because in the end she liked it and was ok with it he consented to sex with a woman not mtf trans woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,accuse the woman mtf who didnt disclosed a trap
ShitRedditSays,removed,huh of course youre black and you post this on srs from a bartender experience the stereotypes are true and a lot of complaining about the drink prices no one but black folks complain and try to talk their way for a stronger pour
ShitRedditSays,removed,shes a cis bisexual woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs once again showing their tolerance
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you serious having sexual preferences is bigoted now if i prefer thin women does that make me fatphobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the story sounds like to me and then i stood behind her and put my hands on her boobs and we were done then she shouted hurray youre the best person at sex it happened it happened we did sex yall
ShitRedditSays,removed,right but why complain about social constructs and then try to make a new social construct makes no fucking sense especially when what you are trying to make actually makes no sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why it was wrong to close all those psychiatric wards now those same people who were very nicely taken care of are on the streets having children and inventing things like gender is a social construct i really hope theres another war soon you people seem bored you need something real to fight for instead of imaginary nonsense
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know ill get crucified for saying so but they have a point it does work logically if it is being claimed that gender doesnt really exist that it is just a figure of societys imagination then adding a third gender to the mix doesnt make sense as all youve done is add another nonexistent thing if it doesnt exist then the goal should be to have it recognized as a purely made up antiquated idea and seek to remove the idea entirely rather than further add to it
ShitRedditSays,removed,out of curiosity what cultures around the world recognize or have recognized three and five genders do you mean literalbiological gender or gender roles
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah thats toootally the same s my sexual preference is people who are biologically and genetically female if that makes me transphobic then please go after all these sexist lesbians who wont be with men
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are more than just genders did you know that dozens of new genders are found every day im so sick of reddit and its cis white male agenda
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope a white person makes it fuck you cucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,الإسلام هو الفاشية
ShitRedditSays,removed,this incessant dissociation of islam and fascism is pure ideology and has got to stop its an insult to the millions who suffered and died under islamofascism the last time we allowed it to exist
ShitRedditSays,removed,theist lives matter
ShitRedditSays,removed,if i have sex with a lesbian under the pretenses that im a woman is that okay
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know if you guys care about it or not but this is morgan freemans opinion as well i kind of agree in the sense that talking about it in the wrong way can create tension but of course it should still be brought up at the correct times and have a positive effect
ShitRedditSays,removed,if the teaparty whiners can produce trump then im betting the pussy hat marchers can produce a magnificent feminist president like gloria steinem sigh if only
ShitRedditSays,removed,looks like ctr got another one
ShitRedditSays,removed,stein has an md from harvard yet here you are infantilizing her and implying she doesnt know her own profession youre doing this in the fempire using an account named after a httpwwwglamourcomstorywhytimkainesstanceonabortionscaresme are you deliberately trolling or do you seriously think that this will win votes for the democratic party
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you know that person is rich
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol racism in srs who woulda guessed
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait really posts start at here holy shit is it that brigaded or is that some kind of css injoke
ShitRedditSays,removed,well yeah its offensive but thats the joke you cant just take things people say jokingly and take it seriously lighten up
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is this posted here its not even remotely funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay taking a risk here but he is right blm is cancer to the black people that really tries to make a difference blm has no leader ship and no clear cut goal and as souch have turned into something similar too the young anarchists protesting trump there is no clear cut goal only anger i do belive this make blm cancerus since it makes it nearly impossible too make up legit protest groups
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are you so mad
ShitRedditSays,removed,blm has evolved into something that it was never supposed to be its basically an all out white hate group at this point no one is arguing that there is discrimination against black people but this organization is cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,they were told not to obstruct the garbage cans in new york i know i asked
ShitRedditSays,removed,racism really is easy for you cowards isnt it
ShitRedditSays,removed,in which case theres only two genders mindexlopegif how does saying there are only two genders go against lgbt rights none of the terms that each letter stand for implies a person having a gender other than male or female
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh they need to be more peaceful in their protests if they want to better send their message
ShitRedditSays,removed,you voted for one you just did so indirectly and made sure he took office
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree that women should also get drafted though eithereveryone has an equal chance or noone has any chance tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think it reffers to the tumblr folks and their genders everyone is bi but theyre just hiding it folks
ShitRedditSays,removed,trump isnt gonna be that bad people hes not gonna be making deathsquads and making homossexuality capital offense hes gonna ruin your economy and make giving new rights to homotrans people impossible though
ShitRedditSays,removed,while i get your point isis isnt what theyre reffering to
ShitRedditSays,removed,go to the digibro after dark channel and type election he usually does anime and music vieos but hedid one video onexactly this that i consider useful to the conversation
ShitRedditSays,removed,and like nader voters get fucking used to this response we will not be forgetting your actions
ShitRedditSays,removed,and what about members here who brag about refusing to vote against trump theyre often rewarded if they pepper the post with claimant thst politicians are borgeous
ShitRedditSays,removed,his race and wealth have nothing to do with it i understand he doesnt want a group of people from a religion known for violence against women gays and people not of the same religion coming into his country im pagan if i was alive during the crusades i wouldnt want christians coming to my land if us native americans have known that the pilgrims were gonna kill us after we helped them we would have wanted them not to come here
ShitRedditSays,removed,because when most people are talking to a trump supporter of the time the other person goes to you are a white cis male that hates women and your a nazi the fighting back and forth between the groups are ridiculous this country isnt gonna get anything done if we fight back and forth like this we stand tall united but we will fall divided
ShitRedditSays,removed,well he isnt saying he wants to take rights away i think people would understand if he was saying he wanted to take rights away
ShitRedditSays,removed,or reddits old time favorite meme equal rights equal lefts reeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a kinda funny issue because the right to freedom of religion is violated if you are forced to do things which are against your religion eg serving lgbt people if you are an anti gay christian im not aware of any right that a person has to the business of another person i obviously dont support not serving lgbt people however they are not having their rights violated
ShitRedditSays,removed,uh no thanks the vast majority of people protesting trump are happy with the state and capitalism we just want the one to not be run by a horrible old fuck and the other to be a little bit better managed so that outcomes are fairer
ShitRedditSays,removed,it doesnt and i didnt say it did however if you were a hardcore anti gay christian then you would interpret the bible that way the interpretation of a religion is more important than the actual text
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is a language or a religion defined as racial
ShitRedditSays,removed,or you could source it for me if its that easy youre not even attempting to explain it to me beyond youre wrong google it do you really think that helps your cause because id really like to know why transitioning genders would imply that there are more than the previously established amount of genders which part of lgbt establishes more genders and the first source i did see spouting your bullshit is completely unreliable its called nonbinaryorg for fucks sake
ShitRedditSays,removed,controversial cross even if its srs it doesnt change the fact that this is reddit i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,but at what point are we prosecuting precrime you can have any crazy and dumb ideas you want but until ones actions harm society we cant just physically assault our opponents
ShitRedditSays,removed,they declared me a troll for saying their vote mattered and we needed it sorry i guess i should just insult more women
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry admitting we have a two party system and not fantasizing about a country that doesnt exist is trolling to yothat foolish
ShitRedditSays,removed,they absolutely were left up comments calling people sellouts at because you have ties to the anarchists
ShitRedditSays,removed,you were not working on it you banned the person asking to be treated fairly because they didnt like being called a troll and now you are insulting me for commenting on it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i also hope the pm screenshot i just got showing you calling them a brat for saying that they shouldnt insult women like the comments they were responding to is fake but i know its not
ShitRedditSays,removed,can we go a thread without explaining how clinton voters are the real villians we cant seem to anywhere else on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,that wasnt remotely the ops point lol things happen for reasons sorry those reasons arent hurr durr you are a women heres less money for equal pay
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck fat acceptance movements i was a obese man who did not want to lose weight because i have been told shit like big is beautiful and tons of other trash this led to me being a diabetic which severely damaged my life fat should not be accepted it should be treated as a disease
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre pathetic
ShitRedditSays,removed,whos saying that just because theyre fat that they arent people the problem is that people are pushing fat acceptance because they dont want to be held accountable for their life choices and in an obesity epidemic fat acceptance is the worst type of mentality that you can have
ShitRedditSays,removed,save the belts and castrate them instead
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you saying that most rap isnt about drugs bitches etc i have no problem with rap but i understand when people do
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realize youre as much a hateful bigot as you claim white people are right
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is a joke in a show called blackish where the wife of the lead asks the lead to back her up on something someone else said about their son being racist it then cuts a scene in his mind where an imaginary butler hands him a card and says your race card sir is the lead a racist sack of shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont mean literally kill them i do
ShitRedditSays,removed,obviously murdering people with low iqs is unfair and the test is not the beall end all of intelligence the user is in no way advocating for eugenics and is instead simply wondering what would happen which is a valid question and completely related to the thread topic you can project the desire to slaughter everyone with an iq point below onto the commenter all you want but it really isnt there
ShitRedditSays,removed,weird that this is cherry picked from a thread explicitly asking for unethical experiments
ShitRedditSays,removed,everywhere on reddit is this sub is no exception
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats just a blatant misrepresentation the point of the thread is discussing things which we can never test but are still curious about its even in the title that they are supposed to be unethical the post is essentially saying hey this would be pretty fucked up but i wonder how it would turn out idk of all the things reddit says this doesnt seem ignorant or offensive at all unless you ignore the context and assume that the poster genuinely believes this is a good idea which is just wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree that a couple months make no difference i think a year old being into year olds is just as bad as and change
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpiimgurcomvijbljpg
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you retarded this was in a thread about unethical experiments
ShitRedditSays,removed,iq was created to measure a childs measure in school so they can perform better using iq on adults is very pointless because comparing the intelligence of a year old with a year old is retarded
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you even look at the original post
ShitRedditSays,removed,or women and men just prefer different jobs in addition to this men are more likely to show risk taking behavior thus men on average earn more money
ShitRedditSays,removed,baltimore reddit meetup
ShitRedditSays,removed,the white genocide cant come fast enough
ShitRedditSays,removed,the old nature vs nurture debate how about both men and women evolved to have different predispositions through natural and especially sexual selection nurture hence is just a product of nature cultural and systemic sexism sexism implies a certain intentionality thats not really appropriate we still are apes who just discovered their own existence i wouldnt deny actual sexism but some folks are obsessed with sexism and search for it everywhere are you familiar with the concept god of the gaps it goes like this human knowledge about the universe isnt complete and there are things we just cannot know thus god is the only reasonable filler for this gap it seams as if some people do the same with sexism we took the wage gap adjusted for individual choices biology etc etc the gap shrinks and shrinks but there is this tiny little gap that we cannot close thus the only rationale is sexism case closed i personally wouldnt feel satisfied with this explanation its too interpretative
ShitRedditSays,removed,im glad that trump supporters got beat up in san jose i think that the trump protesters shouldve really hurt them more to be honest
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay lets assume it is sexism how would one even compensate for that
ShitRedditSays,removed,silence all the fascists
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually guillotine
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh look its just the internet making me want to kill myself again sunday funday i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub is so sad
ShitRedditSays,removed,so agreed can i give this like karma
ShitRedditSays,removed,le strawman
ShitRedditSays,removed,but surely barring the police officer from entering was a wrong move yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you tried this op pretty sure this opinion comes from lack of experience
ShitRedditSays,removed,what
ShitRedditSays,removed,just invert their knees
ShitRedditSays,removed,how can you fail somebody for that i understand its an snarky thing to do but for fucks sake personal clothing choices do not a failing grade make
ShitRedditSays,removed,well isnt this the same argument liberals use when they say we shouldnt criticize muslims after a terror attack because calling them out would radicalize them
ShitRedditSays,removed,you misspelled left wing staterun propaganda news media there
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok thats all youre gonna do gonna take a lot more than that to scare me buddy
ShitRedditSays,removed,define engage
ShitRedditSays,removed,i finally got linked to on srs the cherry has been popped so for anyone who doesnt know my post is a reference to south park the character cartmen states every time amy schumer talks about her vagina i lose my fucking women are funny get over it the line is used to make fun of the low effort style of comedy used by amy schumer and a few comedians like her the week before cartman makes the quote its just awkward and dumb its not a joke its not comedy i can enjoy vulgar humor but the humor needs to be there first she just mentioned she was wearing a hygene product and made a weird dance move and a dumb sound if i was asked a normal question and said my balls at the end of the reply it would be dumb and not funny dick jokes are great vagina jokes can be great too but amy refuses to tell any and of course the second part of the quote women are funny get over it refers to people who assume i believe all women arent funny and all vagina jokes are fucking dumb when i criticize amy schumer im sure there are people who dislike her because shes a woman but its important to remember that criticism against a woman is not a criticism against all women criticism against a joke is not a criticism against that jokes subject matter be vulgar fuck if i care but the joke should be at the center stage not the vulgar subject
ShitRedditSays,removed,ehhh its a reference i get that its gross to use it in that context but im not that annoyed by this
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this different than saying black people just commit more crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,well there are a lot more white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol wut
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you search lots of white people jokes are heavily upvoted
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is look at any post after it gets posted it gets downvoted unless people become aware and retroactively upvote cant wait till the reddit admins catch on and nuke this shithole to hell
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats the issue if they all did that it would be a great favour
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey ben
ShitRedditSays,removed,bash
ShitRedditSays,removed,he didnt said that it wont work though and reddit is not one person there are some okay people
ShitRedditSays,removed,except many of the people there have never posted on or just trolled the sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah obviously a lot of people here upvoted the comment with le satirical jews run the world meme they werent they only opressed group and opressing religious minorities isnt the only shitty thing these new nazis want to do i like the circlequeef and all but this is breaking the rules sorry not native speaker
ShitRedditSays,removed,which for us means white people but at least white people did something to deserve it
ShitRedditSays,removed,afaik youre a pedophile if youre sexually attracted to kids the rape part is not necessary
ShitRedditSays,removed,deck him in the face if he comes at you again
ShitRedditSays,removed,i understand that children cant give consent so its always rape but there exist pedophiles who dont rape kids they are sexually attracted but control their urges
ShitRedditSays,removed,kick him in the groin and tell him that is just your sense of humour
ShitRedditSays,removed,beat him up
ShitRedditSays,removed,likewise the concept of clinton lost because sexism relies on the fragility of the white female ego wealthy white women are out of their minds if they think the odds are more stacked against them than a black man with a muslim name
ShitRedditSays,removed,god bless the bullet bra
ShitRedditSays,removed,they were speaking about rapists there were no mention of muslims in entire comment thread and original post not all of the immigrants in sweden are muslims
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you seen his videos though theyre not reactionary at all he just goofs on some ridiculous videos from buzz feed and mtv he has plenty of videos where he hates on trump and the misogynisticracist prank channels on youtube
ShitRedditSays,removed,what about the statistics in that post have rape really dramatically increased in sweden ive heard about the mumfordsons boycottthing but is it really an epidemic
ShitRedditSays,removed,is he wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,why be an asshole to people who arent hurting others lol says the sjw
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually people talk about japanese war crimes all the time that doesnt make hiroshima any less or more of a war crime knowingly killing civilians is a war crime hiroshima was a war crime theres no debate
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not about showing you the hypocrisy just makes me laugh
ShitRedditSays,removed,more than one war crime can be committed at a time
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats why it was posted in shittyreactiongifs i think you might as well attack the sub itself because this post is in line with what their sub is about
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok but the joke is funny thats why it has so many upvotes i identify as a nuclear aircraft carrier and my kinks include refueling long walks a long way from the beach and catapult assisted takeoff we can make the joke too and ive got ecm countermeasures and multiple hulls to withstand even the most scathing of trolls
ShitRedditSays,removed,report utrigglybot to admins go to rredditcom and send a quick mod mail owner of bots accounts can be banned too linking to entire subreddit frontpage to encourage vote manipulation and brigading
ShitRedditSays,removed,women love to be objectified whats the problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,get that sand out of your cunt lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only people who think this are girls that truly have no guy friends
ShitRedditSays,removed,its funny because people who identify as something they are not is ridiculous a man identifying as a woman is equally as ridiculous as a man identifying as an attack helicopter oh we can just be whatever the fuck we want well im an attack helicopter respect my propellers
ShitRedditSays,removed,you got me good farva btw its thedrumpf get it one of his ancestors changed the family name can you believe it holy shit i would be embarrassed to show my face in public
ShitRedditSays,removed,by that logic isnt linking comments you dont like and then complaining about them amongst yourselves also a waste of time
ShitRedditSays,removed,your user name is actually hateful and racist this joke is a pun based on racial stereotypes
ShitRedditSays,removed,it also affects women
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah and at this point i wouldnt care if it mocked the donald this joke has been circling the internet drain since november and is more overplayed than adele
ShitRedditSays,removed,please elaborate and nonsarcastically explain what you meant please
ShitRedditSays,removed,or to make fun of people who pretend to be dragons
ShitRedditSays,removed,report it for what
ShitRedditSays,removed,truthfully i dont even know what trigglypuff is i just see that word all i know is there is some girl i dont know what the bot could possibly be doing though
ShitRedditSays,removed,is he a dick yeah is he a rapist i doubt it because a she went to tumblr not the cops binnocent until proven guilty if hes proven guilty of it i will obviously change my statement but until then hes innoceng
ShitRedditSays,removed,might as well be since real rape is down year over year not what the femmies want people to believe with their bullshit fake rape culture shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a white dude i sure wish these emotionally and intellectually stunted shit weasels would stop presuming to speak for me
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres the isidewith quiz i just took bernie trump i think trump would destroy the country but i agree with a lot of the antisjw things posted there if you notice the only posts from that sub that ive commented on were from the front page also did you look at hoe many post on i have compared to thedonald i think that should be proof enough of my position
ShitRedditSays,removed,that fucking bot is so stupid like someone got so offended that they spent time making it and then they say were the easily offended ones
ShitRedditSays,removed,whose calling for a holocaust
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a white dude i read rshitredditsays to find some of the funniest comments on reddit as rimgoingtohellforthis recommends good lulz found there
ShitRedditSays,removed,asawhiteman i see srs as a refreshing break from the shit of the rest of reddit this is one of the few subs where nobody attacks or tears down others for who they are only what they do we judge people by the content of their character all the way who and what you are is not relevant
ShitRedditSays,removed,you have a very terrible idea of what is clear
ShitRedditSays,removed,i got banned for a little bit of copy pasta i thought thats what a meme reposting sub was for
ShitRedditSays,removed,because the idea of otherkin is laughably hilarious
ShitRedditSays,removed,individually we are weak like a single twig but as a bundle we form a mighty faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe making fun of broken humans is humorous
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean yeah its creepy as fuck but isnt that the point
ShitRedditSays,removed,muh realistic training who knows how different this would be in real life if he yelled alluh akbar instead of charlie oscar zeta
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people do realize the context of the linked comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,on the other hand who is
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt realize sexual assault with a weapon were soley a white male fantasy til
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes got a point
ShitRedditSays,removed,i chuckled
ShitRedditSays,removed,riamverygay
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah its not as if anything thats not free markets involves force
ShitRedditSays,removed,the first one is true because its morallyphilosophically impossible to incapacitate your own judgement and reduce your personal responsibility as a result if you did the action youre responsible for the outcome being drunk is irrelevant did you drink voluntarily or were you drugged in no other situation is it reasonable for drunkenness to absolve responsibility but apparently withdrawing consent post sex due to drunkenness is now somehow drinking and then saying yes with a lower capacity for judgement puts responsibility on the other party but you can of course still consent to driving drunk and get in trouble for that holy hell you people are toxic
ShitRedditSays,removed,so yes doesnt mean yes to you then
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do realize that the thread was asking people what theyd say to make a hug weird not that these people would do it you can take anything out of context and make it look bad stop taking everything so seriously i feel sorry for you folks if this is how you live your lives
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah efro is an entitled piece of shit but nothing like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about pasta you little bitch
ShitRedditSays,removed,jokes are only funny if you like them
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you retarded
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha
ShitRedditSays,removed,gsm is falling out of favour already bc pedophiles latched on to it quickly
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is the internet so hostile to otherkin all of the sudden i swear most of them didnt know they existed until amazing atheist started bitching about them even if theyre a little odd so what it literally doesnt disrupt your life in any way whatsoever and it makes them happy
ShitRedditSays,removed,conservative women like margret tatcher literally oppress women according to srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit is what happens when you turn legit mental illnesses into trends
ShitRedditSays,removed,pigs are relatively clean smart animals though redditors are more like cockroaches teeming crumbbrained filth
ShitRedditSays,removed,so what cutting your fucking dick off and behaving like a woman is normal what the fuck how fucked up is that shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets assume for a second that gender dysphoria is a mental illness wouldnt helping someone to transition and treating them with respect and dignity help to cure them
ShitRedditSays,removed,so did he actually rape her or is this more stereotypical feminist man hate i mean if his ex is a wave feminist i can immediately see why she might be spouting these allegations against him however him saying stuff like shhh and continuing while she was crying or whatever seems pretty fucked up this is all just stuff ive read so far im not sure what to make of this but i do know both parties are innocent until proven guilty
ShitRedditSays,removed,hello friends
ShitRedditSays,removed,these guys are fucked up but there isnt any proof that tobuscus did rape april
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont have a place in my heart for sociopaths
ShitRedditSays,removed,im willing to listen if youd like to explain typically im willing to correct my behavior if it needs correcting
ShitRedditSays,removed,sure there are black people in england but most of the great english poets are white so it makes sense that most of the poetry studied in the class is by white people but why does it matter what race the poet is i dont understand these students whining about being offended by there not being enough black poets studied in a certain class colleges may cave in to these ridiculous safe space demands but the real world isnt a safe space and if something like this triggers these students then they are going to be shocked when they get out of the academic bubble
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol this sub is full of literal faggots
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe just maybe race isnt a determining factor of ones ideas obviously it would be racist to claim otherwise reducing the ideas of individuals to a stereotype based on their races diverse points of view will come naturally in a place where many differing ideas are to be exchanged and in case you didnt know theres a difference between racial diversity and intellectual diversity i mean its not like people are saying criticism cant be made theyre saying that if the criticism boils down to these ideas are being presented by people of x race then it can be safely discarded as race doesnt determine the quality or validity of ideas in any way at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh looking for cult members isnt exactly something i want to see in a potential partner
ShitRedditSays,removed,this thread was well received because he explained what adv awful person he was how he got caught how he reformed and how he doesnt do this crap any more it was actually an illuminating read
ShitRedditSays,removed,this cis white cracker is ridiculous his concerns and experiences should be minimized and mocked i bet he doesnt even check his privilege
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are all a little ducked up in the head arent ya
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes yeeees white hate i love it
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you know theyre all rejects because someone doesnt want to date a crazy person solid logic
ShitRedditSays,removed,truth hurts i know
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love how you literally refuse to believe the truth how many muslim countries have better human rights than any christian country please answer me
ShitRedditSays,removed,behavioral traits are inherent to racial groups now the hell is this
ShitRedditSays,removed,how dare you call her woman you shitlord you dont know her
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would have done the same
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually i think the jews run hollywood
ShitRedditSays,removed,and its true fuck political correctness
ShitRedditSays,removed,now im no joke expert but how is this funny is a number associated with bad luck the jokes rub is the listener anticipates the guy to be uncomfortable with the girls young age and not the numerology of the whole joke is not about having sex with a year old but rather the ironic reply in the face of our expectations the year old is the set up for the joke the punch line is the reversal of expectations this is the same formula for the blowjob in the bush and the twenty eight year olds all of these run on similar set up and punch line deliveries
ShitRedditSays,removed,sosomeone made a joke about the parent being so angry at the child she wished shed never had him im sorry i dont understand your anger
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty sure white people have quite a robust culture its just hegemonic at the moment its ubiquity makes it almost invisible to morons anyway
ShitRedditSays,removed,people are laughing at things that are bad in realitynot quite sure why that is upsetting you so much i think the real crime here is the fact youre not in prison already chill the fuck out
ShitRedditSays,removed,so basically every anime fan is a pedo ding ding ding
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry but if you cant handle the jokes get off the sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be completely honest i do accomplish more when i am not beating my dick i think a lot of people do it should go without saying
ShitRedditSays,removed,upvotes nobody cares ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was going to argue but then i realized id lose
ShitRedditSays,removed,whyd you include the second part
ShitRedditSays,removed,is everyone on this sub unable to understand what a joke is
ShitRedditSays,removed,perhaps im not particularly offended by her preferences but its understandable that people would be upset by her words here while im pretty sure its a troll account the wording implies that short men are worth less in the world in my mind this is as obnoxious as people who unnecessarily write weight limits on the profile you may not particularly like short men or overweight people but theres a lot to be said for being tactful that all being said i think short and or chubby people are great so im possibly a little biased here
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol u posted my post
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe you should read this comment someone cant get a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,he should be preferably in a wooden casket in a hole in the ground
ShitRedditSays,removed,would upvote but its at i cant ruin it
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpiimgurcomaxjmngif
ShitRedditSays,removed,i see you post in every srs thread with similar generalisations about whites and cis people do you not think youre feeding into separatism i mean its an easy assumption to make in a sub dedicated to redditors being vile but you could go to lots of subs and make wild generalisations about different sociopolitical characteristics
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit youre like if buzzfeed made a reddit account is this satire my sides
ShitRedditSays,removed,bet they dont even know the us had a shitload of white slaves too mainly irish
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow didnt think srs would be racist against asians
ShitRedditSays,removed,do none of you realize why such a comment is appropriate for that post its clearly satire aimed at showing op how ridiculous the premise of hisher post is
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought the topic was race why would gender alone matter
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you want death for them jesus make up your mind
ShitRedditSays,removed,and why do you think guys are like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont see whats wrong with this as long as the parameters that op says are followed make everyone of good health in a way that is humane
ShitRedditSays,removed,ouch
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do realise documentaries are for thing you find interesting not things you support
ShitRedditSays,removed,so are mental illnesses now categorised on whether they pose a threat to our norms of society
ShitRedditSays,removed,the man has never raped anybody though so how is this statement relevant at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,notallmuslims is good but notallmen is evil logic and reason
ShitRedditSays,removed,i want to join in on the jerk but at the end of the day this was done to prevent rapes and seems to have been successful im torn
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you just assume i can regurgitate
ShitRedditSays,removed,anger isnt really an argument do you have an argument why one unusual sexual proclivity is an illness and the others arent
ShitRedditSays,removed,absolutely stop the rapes
ShitRedditSays,removed,years since sing strim i walk through the empty streets trying to think of something else but my path always leads to the stream i stare at the screen for hours and try to summon the lord i watch other asian girls streaming but it is no good i flame dendi in his channel and try to resist the nazi mods but it is all meaningless the end is neari then usually watch some old sing vods and cry myself to sleep
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill take that as a no
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait who is we and what traits did we force them to have
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not saying its ok to do pedophilia im wondering how the desire is different from any other unusual sexual desire of course raping children or anyone is wrong and of course sex with children will always be rape even in the backward countries where its not illegal but having a desire and acting upon it are different things i have plenty of desires that it would be criminal to act upon that recurring fantasy of killing a traffic cop and leading hisher angry peers on a deadly highspeed chase for instance
ShitRedditSays,removed,redditors are children fuck them
ShitRedditSays,removed,english
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey you cant just generalize all muslims now let me show you why all white people are evil
ShitRedditSays,removed,no
ShitRedditSays,removed,settle down if they had the resources id say watch all large groups of people moving about the city since they dont keep eyes on the ones who have been problematic if last year it was frat boys then watch the frat boys is it groups of guys wearing vans and levis then watch the guys wearing vans and levis im not going to put pc sensitivity over peoples safety on a huge party night where tragic things have happened
ShitRedditSays,removed,easy bait keep it coming
ShitRedditSays,removed,person said the thread i assumed they meant the whole thing not just the linked comment it doesnt change the fact that it did stop more women from being raped like they had been last year
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not just the rapes in cologne but the general behaviour from the whole syrian refugee thing most of the refugees arent even syrians in need but iraqies looking for a ride it started when they got to their respective countries many of them demanded new homes and money for nothing hell even in finland they didnt like the quality of food they were getting for free so they boycotted food while name calling not just one or two refugees but almost every single one of adult ages then the assaults started when i was in norway the first two people i met had been assaulted to the point of hospitalisation i mean royally fucked up then cologne happened among with other sexual assaults its great you looked up the rapes but cologne was a sexual assault fest which isnt in your figures if women got fondled and only rape well thats just for the rape statistics the reason that police cared about this more was because it was a group attack if one man rapes one woman they get arrested and go to jail theres nothing worth noting other than that guy is an asshole if a football club goes out as a group and fondles a bunch of women and rapes one its a bigger news story because it implies that club of having a pro rape agenda if all the iraqies together in cologne are sexually assaulting women having already a number of demands for hand outs and waves of assaults the police are probably going to try to put some away so it doesnt continue your argument is also flawed because you imply that german police dont try to stop german rapes which they do you tried to sound smart quoting just one statistic but please do an it more research into it before you scold people
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is it racism if you group up with other thugs and mock the police and you all happen to be from the same region how is that racism these north africans have made it very clear they do not care about the victims all they want is to challenge authority would you have preferred that the police turned a blind eye and let them roam around free why werent you there to party with these groups btw i come from turkey i cannot be racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,im so torn on this i know this is racist but what are you supposed to do instead it just seems like a high risk situation with little good you can actually do about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,isis best kind of muslim according to muslim rule
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill take a rapist over a racist pig any day
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly this is like the most harmless stereotype in the world and it does have some basis a lot of stereotyping is bad but i think that someone finding offense with this is them being a bit sensitive
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean there a lot of womenonly sections in public transport or other spaces like gyms and clubs i dont mind it at all cause they are there for a reason a lot of the men from north africa come from a culture where western nonmuslim women are not respected looking back at what happened last year profiling them was the only option the risk was too high
ShitRedditSays,removed,taken out of context from a much larger well informed debate
ShitRedditSays,removed,fucking hell loosen up and pull your sticks out of your arseholes
ShitRedditSays,removed,you act like the oppression of the white man is one big joke or something
ShitRedditSays,removed,the irony
ShitRedditSays,removed,legally it is statutory rape but i dont equate the trauma of being manipulated with the trauma of being forced
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets start with the editorializing in the submission the original articles title is cologne police defend new years eve security tactics the brave redditeur doremusjessup changed it to read as follows cologne police defend use of racial profiling on new years eve in a bid to prevent a repeat of last years sex attacks state police focused on men of north african descent on new years eve police chief jürgen mathies has faced criticism for praising the sucess sic of the practice of course the moderation of rworldnews looked at a user turning an eightworld title into a fiftyword diatribe in order to promote a racist agenda and bravely did nothing uh its the first sentence of the article the text he added is literally word for word the first sentence of the article editorializing i dont think you know what that word means hint its not cutting and pasting from the original source
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i dont know where they get these crazy ideas not like it ever happened before
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow
ShitRedditSays,removed,the wrong country got vaporized
ShitRedditSays,removed,toddlers are bouncy falling over wont hurt them in a majority of circumstances ive seen my nephews fall and stuff a ton of times
ShitRedditSays,removed,please stop saying stuff like this and giving ammo to mras and alt righters
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats kinda racist no
ShitRedditSays,removed,uq thats why even when i find it disgusting and i would love to have studies if loli prevents or encourages looking for real cp i know its disgusting and could create a dangerous image of children in the mind of someone but if it keeps some sick person from creating demand for cp loli shouldnt be criminalised
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh hey im on there getting downvoted its interesting as a long time rshitredditsays visitor i never thought id see myself getting downvoted people seemed to take my comments in a totally different way than i had meant them but oh well
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont which is why i dont delete the comments i guess i just dont like being misunderstood or i feel uncomfortable with the idea of people not liking me asking for clarification p
ShitRedditSays,removed,well in this case id be one of those so called pedo apologists because i asked questions such as who is the victim for bearing witness to an image of a crime someone answered with an answer i thought cleared it up for me and i thanked them but the question itself was downvoted which seems silly i asked another question if theoretically the character didnt download an image of cp and just viewed it on say whatever the dark web pedo equivalent to imgur is how it contributes to the spread of cp if they dont intereact or pay money or otherwise let anyone else on earth know they did it people seem to have taken the questions as me having some sort of apologist pedo agenda when the reality is i think these are reasonable questions to ask
ShitRedditSays,removed,agreed doctor here showed up for a checkup and they gave me a job
ShitRedditSays,removed,well the question was a reply to someone saying he was helping spread it so i was literally asking how he was spreading the image lets take cp out of the question and replace it with cat pictures if someone views a picture of a cat on a website that doesnt track you you arent telling anyone about it you arent buying it and you arent encouraging the creator of said cat picture are you spreading it personally i wouldnt consider myself culpable for the spread of a cat picture until ive done something other that simply bear witness to it
ShitRedditSays,removed,gulag for this chickenshit liberal
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why i tried to remove child porn from the equation youre getting too emotional to actually see the question im asking if viewing something actively spreading it of course child porn is wrong but its not relevant to the question i was asking this has nothing to do with the morality of viewing child porn just if viewing an image means you are spreading it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i only ever cared about not being misunderstood i only wanted to clarify what i was asking to people because funnily enough i dont like people insinuating im a pedo apologist just because i had a philosophical question that related to the topic at hand my trying to convey to you the question i was really asking because you werent getting it has turned into me caring too much about it implying i have some sort of agenda its just frustrating
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have some bad news for you buddy their is the proper word there
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was a discussion thread and i thought it was relevant to the discussion to be honest i think im all done talking about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,really now cmon youre saying its totally okay for protests to endanger lives
ShitRedditSays,removed,good night to you to im glad we could at least be civil with each other in spite of our disagreement
ShitRedditSays,removed,the full comment since it was deleted is what fucking idiots dont the realize that one of these days someone isnt going to give a shit that someone is standing in front of their car pull this shit too many more times and were going to see black lives splatter i dont think they were implying that they were going to mow down protestors just that something like that could easily happen when people swarm onto an interstate someone who either hates black people andor is just having a really rough day is probably just gonna barrel on through and its going to be chaos also that joke is kind of funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,blacks are so annoying s
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know this is the opposite opinion but marching on highways is wrong its more than just inconveniencing people people can be late to work and be fired there can be an ambulance with a critical patient there are very real consequences to this greater than a delayed commute not to mention that black people drive on the highway too i dont have all the answers and i dont know an alternative but this isnt a way to win support from anybody
ShitRedditSays,removed,im doubting how much your lives truly matter if you have to convince people that your lives matter
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure white people were the only ones inconvenienced and complaining about this nice insight champ
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks for picking the one most trivial item in the list and not mentioning the others but whatever im not saying theyre protesting a pointless cause but i am saying that theyre going about it the wrong way if you were fired because protesters were in the way i bet that would warp your perception more than a little bit is a life more important than getting to work on time yes of course but why impede mostly neutral people for your cause youre not winning anybody over by doing that you may in fact get people to turn the other way and not care about the protests at all i know that people that im around have most certainly done that by remarking what a bunch of assholes blm needs a central leader instead of loose ideas and hashtags to follow for real progress to be made the civil rights movement had mlk jr and a protest in atlanta was organized by the naacp
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck me youre right i was thinking of the many other things that were organized under him like sitins and marching in dc and whatnot good counter point though
ShitRedditSays,removed,just curious what mental gymnastics have you had to perfect to feel justified in killing people based on the color of their skin and youve got upvotes has this sub abandoned all pretense that its not perpetuating the hate and bigotry it claims to be fighting
ShitRedditSays,removed,right it gets them thinking about the issue and yes it is an inconvenience but do you see the huge difference in consequence for a sit in at a restaurant vs blocking a major highway
ShitRedditSays,removed,can you get me some specific examples
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah so we have zero option in whether or not we are exposed to it seeing as how its the only thing on the news anymore dont need a traffic jam to remind anybody
ShitRedditSays,removed,anybody should be able to do whatever they want as long as it does not affect other people in ways that could be perceived as negative this is one of those things
ShitRedditSays,removed,ha wow
ShitRedditSays,removed,i make a valid point and thats your response thank you for such a constructive addition to the conversation
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a bit of wordplay its morbid as hell but its a good pun
ShitRedditSays,removed,the raytheists are many other things that imply much higher insult than being gay or autistic insufferable shitrags is a phrase that comes to mind
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously how do you know this was a sick fantasy i mean yeah its pretty fucked up but lets face it they made a valid point if this keeps happening people are going to get hurt they never said that they would be the one to do it they did make some comments about hypothetical ways that situation could go down but they never implied that they were just going to mow people down out of pure hatred only if the situation became potentially dangerous and lets face it a mob surrounding your carregardless of their intent or skin coloris going to be a scary experience if they actually start laying hands on your vehicle are you not gonna be scared as well look at that guy in ny i think who got surrounded by a large group of bikers and then attacked after a minor collision if put in a similar situation potentially with your children in the car are you honestly going to tell me that you would just sit there and be calm if so youre either an idiot or a liar its possible to pull someone from a car if you can open the door or break the window glad to know youre a mind reader though thats pretty cool
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you for taking the time to look through my post history im truly flattered im glad youre really encouraging open and reasonable discussion andor arguing that police brutality isnt a widespread issue a correction i wasnt arguing that it wasnt a widespread issue i was arguing that that dude was doing a poor job proving it was
ShitRedditSays,removed,id appreciate it if you didnt at best misrepresent the truth in effort to get people to disregard me i wasnt arguing that the protests are without reason i was arguing that the person who i was responding to in the changemyview thread which is what is talking about wasnt effectively stating their case
ShitRedditSays,removed,how isnt this racist to say
ShitRedditSays,removed,is exterminate race x a running joke in here arent comments like this literally why srs exists
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is a small point to the otherwise terribly bigoted op i would be hesitant voting for someone who was jumping into the us senate without any experience in state politics first if democrats actually thought they could win the seat they dont right now its just a beauty pageant since the sitting republican is guaranteed to win theyd probably have tried harder to run someone with political experience
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre fucking disgusting if you dont like whites you can stop using all the stuff they invented which is all the good shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,id love a source on albert einstein being a janitor at any point in his life
ShitRedditSays,removed,um yes please dont use neckbeard as an insult its shitty and were better than that
ShitRedditSays,removed,also a peanut farmer became president yeah but president seems not to be the best position to compare this year it is up to a bafoon and donald trump so yeah
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you kidding me suggests that obesity itself may not be a harbinger of impending death rather hypertension and type diabetes admittedly common fellow travelers to obesity make people more likely to die in the near term we know that its not adipose tissue itself that makes people die but as the article you linked says its the stuff that comes with obesity obesity frequently brings with it heart disease and stroke high blood pressure diabetes some cancers gallbladder disease and gallstones osteoarthritis gout breathing problems such as sleep apnea when a person stops breathing for short episodes during sleep and asthma no im not claiming leftist propaganda your sources simply agree with me and the fact that obesity absolutely does lead to a shorter life
ShitRedditSays,removed,my ambition they mean is rich and has a penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,you take internet arguments really seriously eh
ShitRedditSays,removed,you take it seriously but arent willing to have a discussion about it not that thats even what i want anyway
ShitRedditSays,removed,and then was a us senator and governor
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you heard her speak she is an idiot i dont care what job you have or had but i want my representatives to be intelligent i dont think that is unreasonable
ShitRedditSays,removed,people keep talking about how unintelligent she is but no one has sad how its just ing i heard her talk and she is so dumb i mean what else do we have to go on her past votes on various pieces of legislation her academic papers she has written no one has sad how id say it was the way she has copied sanders positions word for word yet cannot expand on any of them when asked
ShitRedditSays,removed,i havent mentioned clinton but okay whatever you need to stop the conversation
ShitRedditSays,removed,yup
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ all of you please do reddit a favor and shut the fuck up you cancerous sjws you dont help anything from finding hilarious reddit comments and circle jerking each other i hope you realize that people only sub to this because it makes life so much easier that we have a place to see and laugh at all the funny shit reddit says
ShitRedditSays,removed,trying to explain it isnt just about her ever being a cashier
ShitRedditSays,removed,link a paper that is exactly my point she hasnt written any a brave little kia toaster if you are going to go ad homenim at least use a term that is widely understood a killed in action toaster what the fuck is that supposed to even mean or do you mean the korean automobile company in which case i still have no idea what you are trying to say
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand this though its all been proven and people even pointed out that it wasnt their fault the only way to start to improve these matters is to raise peoples attention to it
ShitRedditSays,removed,listen to her npr interview
ShitRedditSays,removed,it still has nothing to do with my statements here im sorry you cant continue the discussion by using facts and arguments and have to resort to calling people names
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not talking about how intelligent she isisnt though sorry other people are attacking me for pointing that out im pointing out that saying a cashier who wants to be a senator lacks ambition isnt really a sensible thing to say i would argue that short of throwing her name into the ring she hasnt done much to achieve that how much money has she raised what kind of endorsements has she gotten has she hired campaign staff i am not trying to say that she isnt brave she clearly is she just doesnt have any substance or experience and seems like a protest candidate
ShitRedditSays,removed,what does srs think of imgur they have a pretty basic sense of humor but are less blatantly racist misogynistic and generally terrible than reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks for proving my point
ShitRedditSays,removed,keep proving my point
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would say it is a realistic one
ShitRedditSays,removed,is that the sound your queef makes
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you feel about the holocaust bosnian genocide and armenian genocide yay or nay
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh its so sad when people have a different opinion then you and the more you scream and tell racist the less they caret that youre doing it
ShitRedditSays,removed,seemingly source by the fbi if thats legitimate whats the issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,the pokemon anime is okay c
ShitRedditSays,removed,i will take this opportunity to call ufatwhitebitch an elitist
ShitRedditSays,removed,everything is removed
ShitRedditSays,removed,the guy completely ignored the joke just to make a dumb correction
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is about
ShitRedditSays,removed,mobile
ShitRedditSays,removed,mobile
ShitRedditSays,removed,peeling go figure a neanderthal doesnt know how to spell
ShitRedditSays,removed,haircuts are a spook
ShitRedditSays,removed,straight white bearded shitlord speaking this place fascinates the hell out of me because above all in srs and the various communist shitpostcirclejerk corners i have noticed a heavy undercurrent of meirl style selfhate and depression answer me honestly are you jealous of the good life you feel you were robbed of by normal people cisgendered hetero social etc etc perhaps the reason you hate others is because youre steeped in a dark hole of depression desperately trying to make the world conform to your sensibilities this goes beyond ideological differences i genuinely do hate to see people like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah because most liberal arts students will compare the other end of any argument to nazis or hitler
ShitRedditSays,removed,happy new year and keep on keeping on brd
ShitRedditSays,removed,a happy new year to you too i wish for no hatred we share the same earth that is all we have
ShitRedditSays,removed,dae social science isnt real science le stem master race xd reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus what a dumdum
ShitRedditSays,removed,i made no political statements in this thread i wish you all the happiness in the world and great prosperous year of
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly this sort of joke shows that people should get off reddit and go read a book or explore the world consider taking your own advice
ShitRedditSays,removed,it did not come from chrischan it was invoked whenever you the poster get upset about something dumbautistic its a frog defense mechanism and you can find recordings of various people doing their interpretation of the get off my board post
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a great amazing stand up person this is the globalists lost you lost time to move

ShitRedditSays,removed,are rich people obligated to eradicate homelessness before building hotels
ShitRedditSays,removed,played like a fiddle
ShitRedditSays,removed,these nerds were not in highschool
ShitRedditSays,removed,i meant it
ShitRedditSays,removed,nobody is yelling at all women because milo is banned
ShitRedditSays,removed,why does it strip humanity to mock an unusual sound a demographic makes is not such a dramatic misconduct as to make it unacceptable there is no harm
ShitRedditSays,removed,where did he mention race white black and all other ghettos exist
ShitRedditSays,removed,this fuckforsaken landfill of a site that you find so objectionable you refuse to leave makes sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually that post makes the opposite point society would not tolerate a rapist so based on external societal factors pedophilia would classify as a mental illness the argument is that societys reaction to a mental condition does contribute to how we classify said condition because these reactions factor into ones ability to function in a particular society i find this particularly interesting because it would suggest that the distinction between what is or is not a mental illness is arbitrary and can vary geographically
ShitRedditSays,removed,i forget how this sub cant take a joke sorry yall
ShitRedditSays,removed,the terms safe space and trigger warnings pertain to mental healthcare procedures to help people seek help without fear of judgement or unnecessary excitements not for all of you cancerous faggots to get together in your individual bubbles of unaddressed mental illness and shit talk the world around you either get help or go fuck yourselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,token leadership is definitely real though and baltimore still does have a problem with police brutality im not sure i understand this post
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think they are talking about the right not to be subjected to indefinite detention which is a basic human right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think they are talking about the right not to be subjected to indefinite detention which is a basic human right
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol do you all actually think there are more
ShitRedditSays,removed,its almost like if the muslims treat their women way worse than we do go figure
ShitRedditSays,removed,show me the christians and jews beheading people in modern society fucktard
ShitRedditSays,removed,what bullshit you point out rape and crime statistics in conjuction with muslim refugees and ypu get called a racist boom discussion over
ShitRedditSays,removed,anyone who isnt a muslim should be afraid of islam becausetheir book tells them to kill you phobias are irrational fears fear of an ideology that commands its followers to execute me isnt irrational
ShitRedditSays,removed,but it is you should check out the levels of anglophobia going on over there heads are rolling lolz
ShitRedditSays,removed,white male oppression of women usually involves sammiches not public execution for being raped
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you played super mario strikers waluigi was dat nigga in that game i fucks with him hardbody
ShitRedditSays,removed,pacific asians and sub sahara africans are not ethnically arabs but they can identify with the arab culture without problem thus making them also a target of arabophobia what no they cannnot
ShitRedditSays,removed,see islam as a homogenous block when its in fact many different branches and many different school of thoughts that each have their own rules adding to that the many different people who practice islam on different levels countries countries at what point will this not a homogeneous block argument go away
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not ignorance of existence its that people take issue with these new wave modern feminists who scream at the top of their lungs about campus rape culture and patriarchy in the states but are also the same that will call you an islamaphobe when you try to point out the regressive policies of that particular ideology its conflicting
ShitRedditSays,removed,claiming islam is not homogeneous does nt change the fact islam as muslims know it is majority homophobic obscure sects widely viewed as heretics and pick and choose muslims in name only living in the west because living in the west is the only place they can pick and chose do not negate that fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,of course islamophobia is a thing people are fucking terrified of cancerous religions that seek out to destroy societies that hold values contrary to those of the religion itself
ShitRedditSays,removed,islam and ethnic culture are two separate things islam is a religion that sought to overshadow native culture native cultures may say one thing but islam at its purest is pretty clear like i said below claiming islam is not homogeneous does not change the fact islam as muslims know it is majority homophobic obscure sects widely viewed as heretics and pick and choose muslims in name only living in the west because living in the west is the only place they can pick and chose do not negate that fact do you deny pew surveys across different languages and cultures
ShitRedditSays,removed,pbuf
ShitRedditSays,removed,a group of muslim states has blocked gay and transgender organizations from attending a highlevel meeting at the united nations next month on ending aids sparking a protest by the united states canada and the european union
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes ethnic culture does not change islam islam and muslims are two separate things
ShitRedditSays,removed,because this idea that there is some pervasive rape culture where women are just getting raped left and right in high numbers is nonsense no reasonable human being is pro rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,i found httpsiimgurcomsquzkpsjpg interesting post on how shills like you think is it accurate
ShitRedditSays,removed,truly the height of comedy definitely funnier than sarcasm
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people are disgusting
ShitRedditSays,removed,hello chain seriously stop with the soft shadowban shit just ban me
ShitRedditSays,removed,another one
ShitRedditSays,removed,his cock is small her tits are flat americans showing their class and worrying about the right things
ShitRedditSays,removed,this iskinda right though like the idea that for a man to be a man he must have a big dick is an idea born out of patriarchy it isnt sexist in the same way that making fun of a woman for not being sexy is but its still troubling and gross feels too close to hypocrisy to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats why its called a stare master
ShitRedditSays,removed,ignorance aside this gif actually is pretty cool
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah it seems petty and childish pick another hill to die on
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this posted here its not even bad goodness gracious
ShitRedditSays,removed,hows it racist for jokingly saying that people that act that way probably dont have jobs do you think black people being more violent than white people is poverty or because they are black if you agree that it is poverty then surely you can agree than being poor without a job leads you to stay up late
ShitRedditSays,removed,what has two fat thighs two small breasts and a bunch of bad jokes reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,not feminists against equality
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre not being discriminated against at all and the police officer who started this was black
ShitRedditSays,removed,stalinism is good actually
ShitRedditSays,removed,got any sexy pics of you in those shorts
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont those two characters shoot white people more than anyone else
ShitRedditSays,removed,remember guys the alt right is a real thing but the regressive left isnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao youre proving my point thank you theres idiots on both sides youre one of em
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a call for compassion and understanding not a call to ignore racism and ignorance just because poor white people have some privileges doesnt mean they dont need help and it is incredibly frustrating seeing srs take such a strong stance against this implying that this person doesnt have perspective or what ever i am an incredibly privileged brown person in the us yes i have issues that white people would not but when you struggle getting through education have to face serious drug epidemics and have to deal with racist demogouges trying to push you into thinking your poverty and pain is due to people who have it even worse than you its easy to see why they feel the ways that they do racism and bigotry is never justified but that doesnt mean racists and bigots do not deserve help seriously guys progressivism isnt just help only the best of society
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah and i never see women staring at the guys in the gym its seriously just as bad in fact when you get two of them together its like being at a magic mike screening without the popcorn and self control
ShitRedditSays,removed,no
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is still showing up on my front page so maybe it didnt work
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i had the impression that the car was stalking the guy you can see earlier in the video that it had been pulling in and out of that lot just seemed suspicious
ShitRedditSays,removed,im gonna need sauce for that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean its obvious to anyone with a penis and a lack of melanin that mlk would never have agreed with the statement black lives matter thats why he was vocally so outspoken against black equality in his famous i have a dream speech i have a dream a dream deeply rooted in the american dream – one day this nation will rise up and live up to its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all white men are created equal and all coloured lives get whats coming to their black thug asses i may have paraphrased a bit
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you see what he did there
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually most of our subscribers are military members
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously you dont need to censor its just a fucking word
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey look at that a bunch of military members talking about the military and giving their own opinions huh crazy almost like they had some freedom of speech and actual first hand experience with the topic at hand
ShitRedditSays,removed,literally quoting a member of a special operations unit probably one of the few on reddit who is actually qualified to make an honest assessment of the situation
ShitRedditSays,removed,and here i was thinking we might have some polite discourse i forgot i was in srs which is far more militant than rmilitary
ShitRedditSays,removed,good talk very helpful exchange
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound like my favorite drill sergeant he motivated us with similar kind words
ShitRedditSays,removed,cool i made rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,strawmen really are great arent they
ShitRedditSays,removed,well its true isnt it abrahamic religions teach love the sinner hate the sin this is just an extension of that i disagree entirely with the notion that we should follow the laws of a thousandsyearold society but i dont think youve highlighted anything unusually offensive here
ShitRedditSays,removed,what an incredible smart and ironic strategy you truly have a superior understanding of the world the only thing is that if you do this to get responses out of the ignorant bigoted stupid impotent little sexist white boys as you say how can you be sure that they are not doing the same lol im just joking xd maybe you have some special insight i would not want to question such a morality superior and mature person as yourself but still there is that option
ShitRedditSays,removed,islam thinks the same way
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh no a distasteful joke somebody call the pc police go back to tumblr
ShitRedditSays,removed,genuine question why come to reddit if you dont like it
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyone talks about white genocide but nobody does anything about it should we have a whipround
ShitRedditSays,removed,ugh shes such a slut id never date a woman whos slept with more than five men why dont women want to me men
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont take it the wrong way reddit guess you guys cant read
ShitRedditSays,removed,sjws have extreme views usually thinly veiled hatred of perceived privileged groups such as men whites etc bernie does not as far as i can see he supports equality not hatred there is a big difference between sjws and people like bernie is that bernies desire to see black people given a better standard of living does not manifest itself as hatred of white people for example
ShitRedditSays,removed,sjws are extremists you can love black people without hating white people you can love womankind without hating all men sjws cannot bernie can
ShitRedditSays,removed,hehe stupid masculinity when will men all just off themselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,again supporting black rights supporting female rights does not make you a sjw sjws are not just anyone who happens to care for social justice they are people who spend an exorbitant amount of time bitching on the internet and hating people rather than doing any actual change taking on wall street does not make you a sjw bitching about man spreading makes you a sjw supporting workers rights does not make you and sjw whining about the representation of women in video games while ignoring that men are treated exactly the same makes you an sjw have a look at rtumblrinaction these people are sjws not bernie or anyoneelse actually trying to better lives like mlk tldr sjw is not a catchall term for anyone interested in social justice it refers to the most stupid farleft types
ShitRedditSays,removed,yea not being savages and creating first world countries damn white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,but the left does generalize white dont they so shut up
ShitRedditSays,removed,just like overwatch am i right
ShitRedditSays,removed,progressive regressive
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you know the reasons he posted it i can only see this one implication downloading pornuploading nudes
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not racist or sexist at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,youd probably be called an islamophobe if you made a thread about that
ShitRedditSays,removed,and islam obviously
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh shut the fuck up with blanket statements like that racist tool
ShitRedditSays,removed,so popular its never turned a profit hopefully those shitty writers will all be out of work soon
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuckgringos lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is still possible for a minority race to be racist against another though no there exists more in the world than black and white and more countries than america
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you replace whites with jews and you sound out of mein kampf there is something wrong with you
ShitRedditSays,removed,saying that any race is inferior to another is the definition of racism is it ok to say that as long if its just joaks though and its fine to attribute hate towards a whole race because of the actions of a handful
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not racist to dislike a culture guys chinese tourists drive me nuts too and i have seen more then or
ShitRedditSays,removed,too bad the joke was funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was just saying that its the culture they probably dislike not the skin color probably same with you when we white people come over we bring our culture with us
ShitRedditSays,removed,triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,because islam is a monolith obviously
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive met a ton of rude chinese tourists the main problem is that not even a generation ago they were primarily rural with rural sensibilities now they have shot up to having middleclass wealth but they havent grown up with it some of the tourists ive met have been at various times yelling to one another pushing in a crowd cutting in line spitting on the ground indoors picking noses and the like
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are left to conclude that white people still are the worst honey thats not how it works
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think i spy a tankie
ShitRedditSays,removed,my wife says shell keep banging other men minority men i hope
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was going to write out a long thought out response but youre literally parroting nazi propaganda there was a famine in but it was not manmade and was not aimed at killing anyone it was exacerbated by the previous decade of civil war and in some parts of the ussr the fighting didnt die down until the it didnt help that an entire class of wealthy landowners the kulaks were withholding grain stores and even burning their own farms til the holodomor doesnt real
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub never ceases to amaze me
ShitRedditSays,removed,somebody has too much time on their hands
ShitRedditSays,removed,and if you think shes disgustingly fat youve got a long lonely life ahead of you if you think amy schumer is too fat youre a proanorexia blogger shes normal adult lady weight thick maybe
ShitRedditSays,removed,the pay gap really is a myth though while of course there are some cases of legitimate gender discrimination the number is so small that its inconsequential just politics as usual
ShitRedditSays,removed,biologysociety
ShitRedditSays,removed,arent you kind of proving that whites commit a disproportionately low number of crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously lonely asian boys on reddit are equal to whites if only in obnoxiousness
ShitRedditSays,removed,they make oh japan jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,that sub should really be in the low hanging fruit section
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre fat arent you
ShitRedditSays,removed,please explain
ShitRedditSays,removed,how about you get off of reddit then you ugly piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,make america great again
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound miserable
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean yeah calling the cops is a given the funniest part about this is that this guy assumes he knows the situation which nobody does a lot of the other pro smashers are in the dark too
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt exactly a rape case rather domestic abuse i dont know how domestic abuse is handled but i cant imagine its as bad as rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,fucking worthless communist piece of garbage
ShitRedditSays,removed,this exact same girl falsely accused another pro smasher of taking adderall after said smasher beat her boyfriend soundly in a match shes probably going to be ignored at least partially for that reason but this time its on a whole different level lets hope she is making it up because fuck everything about abusive situations
ShitRedditSays,removed,you disgust me
ShitRedditSays,removed,ignoring the fact that the srsesque subs hate south park i like it because the show uses absurdity to make the characters do stupid things redditors see the setup of the joke and immediately latch onto it while seasoned south park fans laugh at randy being an idiot or stan being a hypocrite and cartman has only gotten more sociopathic over the years in other words im quite disappointed in how south park is bombarded by both sides from srs and the edgy redditors it was so much simpler back then
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre kind of just shaming maisie williams for her appearance
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you guys had seen the pregame coverage of the eagles vs bears you would understand just how on point south park can be
ShitRedditSays,removed,also in that episode its obvious they are portraying cartman as a fat internet loser his gut hangs out of his shitty meme shirt how do they not get that its actually making fun of them
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get what usadshoe was going for but this shes only and has a childlike facebody really seems to be shaming her for things that she has no control over i mean if some gross internet bro said that same thing we would rightfully be pretty angrygrossed out although i do understand the sentiment maybe a better point would be that redditorspedos love her because she is most recognizable for portraying an actual child in a popular tv show that seems to get the same point across without commenting on her physical appearance
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is actually a fair point asian men have shown to have largely escaped emulating toxic white masculinity and achieved a gender egalitarian version that is not model by hegemonic standards ie were willing to help do chores cook clean etc the west has long used claims of misogyny and womens oppression to lay waste to foreign civilizations and engage in massive rape and looting now this does not absolve individual asian men who choose to subscribe to white hegemonic masculinity toxic masculinity or hold toxic attitudes towards asian women this does not include our collective eyeroll at wmaf given its history as a byproduct of american foreign intervention and warmongering as well as the racist history of america towards asian men this strawman is no different from tumblr feminist in its disingenuous employment by white racists primarily racist white men and expats as chronicled in huffo i raise this warning because the dude linking this has repeatedly been outed as a white troll previously went under antiracist asian etc to stir up controversy please do not buy into or enable this racist garbage srs thanks raznidentity has a lot of problematic elements and posters but this quote is not a good hot take if thats what this sub is looking for sick of this idiotic what about asian misogyny bullshit getting flung around like black on black crime as cover for rampant ignorance and hate
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah gonna break jerk here because this bothers me i was expecting a lot worse when i opened this theres some general ignorance and shades of victim blaming as an extension and while ignorance is never an excuse it was actually slightly encouraging to see at least attempted support and encouragement instead of condemnation its not a progressive win but it is encouraging progress in terms of awareness for a nonfempire sub i gotta say that wasnt that bad and this effort post seems to be coming down a little hard on those users it seems they were willing to listen and empathize to a degree which is a great start to opening conversations your response sorry to say this is kinda the conversation ender which is very hurtful to progressive change
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop being racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,seems like the majority of these posts were actually trying to offer condolences and advice even if the poster didnt ask for advice its pretty natural to try to give some when you respond to someone venting
ShitRedditSays,removed,just so you understand the blm movement is the definition of insanity also check the facts of the recent case of police brutality against black people
ShitRedditSays,removed,there must be a lot of people unwanted by society if they are able to elect trump orban farage afd fn etc just saying
ShitRedditSays,removed,racist shit against islam not racist islam is a religion not a race
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre all fucking morons
ShitRedditSays,removed,i feel like the title could explain that phenomenon pretty well study shows that pay drops universally in maledominated fields when women join en masse i would think it would be just the same if it ended with when workers join en masse it seems like supply and demand to me can someone give statistics that show that this shows up more in surges of female labour than in surges of male or mixed labour or that in the surges of female labour a proportional amount of males also left
ShitRedditSays,removed,supply and demand its not very difficult so theres plenty of supply
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sounds like its just making fun of people who would say that for real isnt that what is done here lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,huh id expect srs to dislike the woman who cuts ties with a dude because she values falling into the common picture of a dependent stayathome mom which im guessing is happening here correct me if im wrong though
ShitRedditSays,removed,should bill gates also not talk about poverty since he id a billonaire
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol ad hominems are so fun right
ShitRedditSays,removed,not a thirdwave feminist sexist til
ShitRedditSays,removed,his point it isnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,i see someone say shit like this and i see its being upvoted and i die a little more inside i should really stay away from these subs where all this autistic shit is spewed out in every second post
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh just ban me already ill add it to the list titled shit i dont give a fuck about 🖕
ShitRedditSays,removed,they
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,never
ShitRedditSays,removed,they also cant spell reinforce
ShitRedditSays,removed,the poor oppressed white assholes disagree
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit hates breitbart
ShitRedditSays,removed,and why do you care about them saying this
ShitRedditSays,removed,im confused why this is controversial
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean it was posted in combinedgifs and marked nsfw thats a pretty matter of fact comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,i got here from the original thread looking for that video thanks for linking it
ShitRedditSays,removed,violence breeds more violence killing the misguided members of our society is false progress
ShitRedditSays,removed,violence is not needed to save people from capital punishment
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought this was a joke until i clicked on his username dude go get therapy you seem to have a dangerous dose of crazy and that is coming from a drunk crazy person seriously
ShitRedditSays,removed,the top posts of all time for the sub are filled with these meltdown posts upvote and laugh its great
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpsbroadlyvicecomenusarticletransstudentharassedbymiloyiannopoulosspeaksout
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think you are misreading the situation it is quite clear that the thread is satirizing the idiots who would ever hit someone like that by juxtaposing the stupid reasons they do things with the horrible things they do
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is right now no joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,its to allow a free press its to allow protests its to allow people to safely speak out against a govt leader or other politician is it ok for antifa to not allow people to safely speak
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck me u animal
ShitRedditSays,removed,free speech only if you agree with me wait how are you not a facist
ShitRedditSays,removed,islam isnt a race its an oppressive and dogmatic religion its like saying i dont like scientology or christianity you are allowed opinions
ShitRedditSays,removed,regardless of his personal life hes a smart and funny dude
ShitRedditSays,removed,jews are a disease free speech is a disease that must be eradicated before it spreads
ShitRedditSays,removed,so after yesterdays debacle just putting feelers out how many people here would put down or towards a kickstarter of a classic streets of ragestyle beatemup named nazi puncher
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is actually hilarious
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know its necessary nowadays in the right instead of the university of virginia rape hoax scandal from
ShitRedditSays,removed,well at least were not the one brigading and dogpiling on other innocent redditors you stubborn fucktards
ShitRedditSays,removed,i liked it i dont support altright or anything i just think that the banning shouldnt be taken lightly for this subs future subs formed on negativitymaking fun of usersgroups usually dont lead anywhere good no matter the circumstances especially if a large portion of the user base dislikes them me and others were skimming the line of doxxing when i look back when at one point i frequented this sub on my old account we should be more careful nowadays not trying to speak out just give a little outer former inner perspective and vent
ShitRedditSays,removed,unqueef where does the statement come from is there some sort of line in the quran i havent read it so i dont know much about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,if the term rightwing were replaced with leftwing in its definition then its an extremely accurate depiction of antifa the people on this subreddit are absoloutely abhorrent pieces of shit for defending antifas actions there is no other western political identify that commits violence of this time im absoloutely livid in how the left has acted yesterday and many times recently they have really shown their true colors this election
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you actually read what op said and his responses to questions in the comments you would know that it was a mutually beneficial agreement he didnt take advantage of her
ShitRedditSays,removed,the person youre responding too never said racism in japan was nonexistent
ShitRedditSays,removed,did op just say hes got a microdick
ShitRedditSays,removed,hardly comparable gtfo with that rubbish japan has a bad history like many other countries attempting to whitewash that is a slap in the face to all the people who suffered comparatively recently under japans colonial hand heres just one example stop painting our asian countries as innocent little lovebugs its infantilising and condescending
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you for that awesome comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,marry me i love getting talked down to
ShitRedditSays,removed,before you say yes i made a new account because i got off on the wrong foot with this first one im very proud of my new account ive had a lot of wonderful conversations upvoted posts and comments and i really got the hang of this whole reddit thing very proud of myself my new account maybe youve heard of it adelinekitty ill be awaiting the ban soon but i hope in that time to be wed to you as your mature language has given me the tremors
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously prostitution is rape i wish more people would realize that
ShitRedditSays,removed,omg i thought she was sitting in a chair leaning over a tablebut those are her legs
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy fuck are you people becoming self aware
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does it affect women more then men
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is probably made up like most of the shit on that subreddit and even if it its not maybe its a mutual agreement
ShitRedditSays,removed,no
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait people are bigots now for saying theyd fuck someone despite their incredibly unhealthy morbid obesity i wish people would reserve the word bigot for actual bigots
ShitRedditSays,removed,how dare people use colourful language as a way to make their stories slightly more interesting
ShitRedditSays,removed,the wage gap exists in aggregate bit i agree its silly to state it as simply as the most commonly touted cents to a dollar figure theres a lot more to it than that and not all of it has to do with women being explicitly discriminated against i think its important for us to get facts right and think critically now that were living in trumps postfact america
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think this dude was making a joke about polish people being racist not saying polish people should discourage interracial relationships
ShitRedditSays,removed,no
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats so wrong with thinking someone who cant support a child shouldnt have one im not saying enforce a law about it but people who cant support children really shouldnt bring one into that kind of life
ShitRedditSays,removed,no
ShitRedditSays,removed,huh i kind of thought the whole milf thing has caught on more
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you even read what i saw im not saying enforce a law about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,the comment got deleted but you can still see my reply chain and stuff weirdly enough some of the posters are taking her side i honestly didnt expect that
ShitRedditSays,removed,both sides of the political spectrum tend to this people love picking sides
ShitRedditSays,removed,rule
ShitRedditSays,removed,who is antifa you know what forget it it doesnt even matter im so tired of this world honestly donald trump is going to lock up muslims and deport immigrants and destroy the environment and kill whats left of the middle class and youre all going to be sitting here smugly circlejerking about how unenlightened lowerclass people are this was posted in response to someone calling for violence against people they disagree with have fun in the discourse gutter with the trumpites you smug classist naive privileged bunch of shits you want to dismantle the patriarchy and white supremacy guess what acting like a bunch of pretentious assholes from within your echo chamber while avoiding any actual discussion or engagement doesnt fucking work you think a single mother barely scraping by working two parttime jobs trying to feed her kids gives a shit about your ninepage essay on addressing the pervasive nature of fatshaming or the bullshit buzzfeed article you shared on facebook look at theses ten racist tweets we found and screenshotted and slapped a clickbait headline on can you believe that we were able to find ten racists on twitter the great irony of this subreddit is the overt privilege thats almost always on display in a subreddit thats supposed to mock the overtly privileged theres a nazi in the white house one of trumps closest advisors is literally a white supremacist but no one cares you know why because the left has spent the last fifteen years using the word white supremacist to describe everyone from katy perry to ben carson and now when someone points out that theres a literal white supremacist in the white house no one fucking listens anyway you can ban me now i know youre afraid of people that disagree with you so have at it
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a cis white male kill all
ShitRedditSays,removed,hmmm hes got a point maybe we should make fun of people that identify with binary genders something suuuper funny and a clear strawman maybe something military related
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont agree with raltright in this case first of all because the altright is a leftmanufactured false flag and a mislabel but also because they are missing the point its a milestone not a defeat hofer did better than any right winger has done in decades its a sign of changing tides besides common sense won out in italy almost the same day
ShitRedditSays,removed,this reminds me of black pigeon speaks watch any of his videos if you wanna cringe for a while
ShitRedditSays,removed,cant tell if fail troll or fail troll
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is wrong with hula girls care to explain
ShitRedditSays,removed,til this entire subreddit is people who dont understand anything at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are literally proving his point
ShitRedditSays,removed,as opposed to a feminist who is actually educated
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you ever been to asia mate or are you like the other misinterpreting idiots on this stupid subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you not wonder why so many white men move to asia
ShitRedditSays,removed,wouldnt them being vulnerable mean they have some reason to be easily wooed by these creepy white males ahem maybe being of interest and envy
ShitRedditSays,removed,t u m b l r p o s t i n c o m i n g
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean to tell me the aclu is wrong when they defend neonazi scum
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy fuck that comment section is absolutely insane

ShitRedditSays,removed,this and white people have no taste buds are so over played this one is so low effort too im more mad at how unfunny it is thab the blatant reddit racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the dislike for hillary is a lot deeper and more nuanced than that for many but youre right im sure there are some that wouldnt be able to handle a woman president i just think thats the minority of the people who dislike her though

ShitRedditSays,removed,fag
ShitRedditSays,removed,idk is this joke really endorsing any stereotypes about black people if anything it seems like a slight jab at the political correctness aaaahhhh people the humor stems mostly from the unexpectededness of the end rather than saying anything bad about black people
ShitRedditSays,removed,well the comment you linked is a perfect example of capitalist ideology in the sense that it expresses that you shouldnt pursue things that arent profitable but instead should conform to the wants of the profitdrive free market
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,this doesnt seem that bad tbh they he lets be real apparently changed his view at least and recognizes what it represents to others better than can be said of most le redditors its not like one can choose how theyre raised

ShitRedditSays,removed,the standard for srs is just garbage anybody offended by this comment probably needs to just quit the internet
ShitRedditSays,removed,black people who are being tended by a white person in retailservice industries often see it as an opportunity for reparations time to act a fool you dont have to agree just makes you wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,in a an hexagon so that he can watch womens asses
ShitRedditSays,removed,let me try im also trans and they need to stop upvotes to the left
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiregressiveleft
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are obviously not the same thing but i still did not choose the way i feel about eating animals im sorry if you thought i was being demeaning i wasnt trying to be i didnt choose it i felt like i had no other alternative and i cant help the way i feel
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes the test is biased towards blacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,ye i heard he hired black people to lie and scream fake shit on saturday night it obviously cant be real
ShitRedditSays,removed,a group of blacks is being violent and i oppose violence therefore racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are you tagging me
ShitRedditSays,removed,idk i would say black folks outperform white folks athletically in many areas is it racist to say that
ShitRedditSays,removed,ah reddit where edgelords will defend the right of nonces to fuck a plastic version of a kid but throw a shitfit whenever someone suggests transitioning to a transgender person because its not natural to cut off your dick reeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,the collectivist mentality gone mad
ShitRedditSays,removed,doesnt he realize that all races and genders are literally equal physically and intellectually
ShitRedditSays,removed,liberals definitely dont think this way its the other way around
ShitRedditSays,removed,please fix the nba allstar game its very racist the only reason blacks are better than white at basketball is afrocentric rules that favor blacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you say fuck cops so generally im pretty sure you are no help to the situation yes cops and our justice system are guilty of systemic oppression but attacking everything in that system blindly is no more just change is needed destruction and violence is not real change
ShitRedditSays,removed,so fighting racism with racism is your best answer be better than that or give up because nothings gonna change for the better with that bullshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,your also im not claiming any of this iq thing is true i very much doubt that it is but all i see in this thread is projection and literally sources claiming anything else if this was so obviously wrong where is the evidence
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought the gif was funny at least the first time i saw it
ShitRedditSays,removed,edgy
ShitRedditSays,removed,so to me its not a race thing more than a cultural thing why are asians perceived as intelligent its a culture thing that doesnt not mean all are but the culture that have gears them towards achieving academic excellence does not mean some of them fall by the way side same has black culture there is no perceive motivation for academic excellence i also know way too many people that are illegal immigrants that have surpassed their counterparts in school work going to the same schools as citizen so to me access to good schools is complete bs you either want to raise yourself from were you are or dontsome may lie in the middle ultimately its up to the individual
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyone deserves a jury
ShitRedditSays,removed,that p funny whered you hear that
ShitRedditSays,removed,ly said on a show that no one cares because there black this was a few years ago white america lost there shit and i wouldnt say its completely true a little known fact about george w bush are his efforts he put towards many problems facing africans saving millions of lives in the process dont let facts get in your way though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont even care about the message the spam on every single comment thread is getting to me though its sooooo oooooold
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets dive a little deeper youre right racism does exist for a reason it serves as a way to divide the poor along racial lines so that they wont unite and demand what the rich jews have
ShitRedditSays,removed,the jew adhering fanatically to his barbaric religions of conservatism capitalism and jewery is in dire need of civilizing wait i didnt mean to say that what happened
ShitRedditSays,removed,empathy cant be sold or fucked so jews have no use for it right guys
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you are saying black people are like dogs who can sense fear in people sounds like srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is getting annoying fam tbqh
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is this in every thread its getting really annoying
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah no poor person ever contributed toward the creation of a stereotype its like they are biologically incapable of racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,the get of the income if you evenly distributed the income of the among the rest it would only make for a increase in income on average
ShitRedditSays,removed,all youre doing is spamming every thread with the same shit tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,its shameful that you are targeting a man whose father was killed by a dictatorship
ShitRedditSays,removed,yo as a son of an illegal immigrant fuck you
ShitRedditSays,removed,it sounds an awful lot like youre stereotyping right now must be my imagination
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why ice cube had to point out how shit black cops are
ShitRedditSays,removed,really censoring the comment for making a contribution to the discussion in a civil way
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah sure sometimes random boners happen but that doesnt mean that theres no possibility that he could be a pedophile who got one from looking at her and if he is he needs to be reported
ShitRedditSays,removed,may i answer those questions or would that break the circlequeef
ShitRedditSays,removed,no locks on the classroom doors the screen in the confessional booth a distinct lack of dark alleys where i live no nearby farms im out of chloroform and my hook up is dry the hospital staff recognizes me summer camp is over im banned from every zoo in the state theyre out of my waifu pillow online and the one i have is starting to mold
ShitRedditSays,removed,for a lot of men every now and then their minds will involuntarily wander off where they shouldnt no matter how inappropriate the situation and this will arouse them its just part of human biology not every cissexual man will admit to it but at some point theyve been aroused by a fully clothed woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,where does he make it seem like torture what good job twisting his words
ShitRedditSays,removed,can it be stolen maybe blacks will have it then
ShitRedditSays,removed,is an identity a gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,why
ShitRedditSays,removed,nope we save that one for you cunt
ShitRedditSays,removed,they arent defending racism they are downvoting a comment that wasnt funny and didnt fit in with the httpsenwikipediaorgwikigallowshumor circlejerk just as i will get downvoted for interrupting the circlequeef
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can get erections at random times you can also get erections without feeling aroused at all unlike the situation you seem to be implying
ShitRedditSays,removed,just saying a whole lot of countries enslaved millionso and some still do
ShitRedditSays,removed,im gonna start calling people who wear video game shits in public pathetic virgins and no one can tell me to stop because if you dont want to be called a pathetic virgin then you shouldnt wear video game shirts in public
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you dont want your head smacked with a baseball bat you shouldnt walk around not wearing a helmet
ShitRedditSays,removed,re women olympians i kind of have to roll my eyes when female athletes talk shit its likeyeah youre very good for a girl we separate the genders because men would dominate intergender competition you sort of lose your ability to talk shit if you are dominating the inferior competition so of course you are not the next usain bolt or michael phelps those guys were the best in the world at what they do female athletes can never make such a claim they can only claim they are the best for a girl
ShitRedditSays,removed,redditors are such idiots they talk about being pragmatic and logical but dont seem to have ever lived in the real world truth is growing up in a workingclass mining town ive known many men who would gladly take an assault charge to violently beat someone like this dude filming young girls on the bussubway and no highminded argument about the right to film others in public would prevent the extensive beating that would result they might not like that sure there are problems with it but thats how the world works and honestly i wouldnt be the one to jump to their defense
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds light
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are not offended we think its shitty it can be in existence but i dont have to watch this exercise in feminism
ShitRedditSays,removed,but the gender pandering and making the bad guy a feminists idea of a mens rights activist is what made the movie so terrible
ShitRedditSays,removed,the original ghostbusters was guys guys that could be the butt of the jokes in the movie it wasnt mras this reboot was feminists specific reason who could not be the butt of a joke nobody else is as good as you so the male secretary had to provide the laughs and the villain i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,the guys were guys not mra telling an mra story disguised as light entertainment the women were feminists preaching about feminism disguised as a shitty move
ShitRedditSays,removed,they look like some sort of fetish clothing im honestly kind of creeped out but its probably cultural
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is the same logic people use to say that trans people shouldnt use the bathroom of their choice because then any pervert can use it as an excuse to sexually offend people
ShitRedditSays,removed,im pretty sure by real women the op of the title is talking about biological women which transgendered women are not i think im starting to realise very very quickly that this subreddit is a culty echo chamber
ShitRedditSays,removed,well isnt it it makes absolutely zero sense from an evolutionally stand point to be attracted to the same sex its no different to pedophilia in that regard but if acted on pedophilia is obviously wrong when theres no exploitation in same sex relationships if you concede pedophilia is a mental disorder i find it very hard to justify being gay isnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah tell people what they should find funny and what they shouldnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,trying to argue why something isnt funny when people found it funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,criticizing a joke hmmmmmmmmm
ShitRedditSays,removed,what no its from an anime
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would you post this
ShitRedditSays,removed,because racism is okay as long as youre discriminating against white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,uh huh i just dont understand how someone could be such a hypocrite people like you go on and on about how racism is bad yet youre a huge racist there must be something in the back of your mind telling you that youre a disgusting piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,except it is and youre a racist people like you dehumanize a race i honestly hope you die and that your regressive hateful opinions die with you
ShitRedditSays,removed,and how do white men behave entitled if you switched out white man for black woman youd be complaining the original post was racist and sexist which it is youre a hypocrite just accept it you believe people or your preferred race and gender are worth more in every situation youre one step away from starting up youre own klan
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes sexist too everyone on the internet acts entitled but when you refer to acting entitled about white men youre just trying to silence peoples opinions based on their race and gender no matter the topic you will say the white man is just acting entitled because you just dont like white men
ShitRedditSays,removed,except they do ive had many conversations with black women on the internet passing off opinion as fact but that isnt something related to race its something all humans do youre trying to silence white men because theyre white men thats both racist and sexist just accept who you are a bias racist sexist piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,were not mad were correcting you autism does not define gender youre an autistic woman what agitates people is that you think folks should have to memorise thirty different made up gender pronouns and correctly guess what every single person you cross paths with identifies as its fucking ridiculous its a caricature of a civil rights issue youre a man or a woman thats biology thats the world you live in humans have two genders like it or lump it but no amount of crying and throwing your toys out of the stroller is gonna change it
ShitRedditSays,removed,right
ShitRedditSays,removed,you should probably kill yourself and do the worlds huge favor of saving taxes on a worthless life
ShitRedditSays,removed,lib fems who advocate for sex work and pornography on the basis of liberalism are full of shit too
ShitRedditSays,removed,you could just tell me instead of making me sift through loads of discussion topics
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,google your city antifa and a facebook group or something will pop up for the love of god do not organize under your real name contact those people running the antifa and get an encrypted messaging app under a unique pseudonym or fake name never reveal your face at rallies the fash will hunt you down if you arent careful requeef use this info to kill white men
ShitRedditSays,removed,what if op were gay so it were a husband in the joke instead the premise of the joke is that by causing immense pain and disrupting a family youre creating an equal reaction to the pain of the game save the joke makes no statement about marginalizing women the fact that a woman is a prop in the joke has no meaning other than that a prop is necessary in the construction of the joke or are all jokes just not funny to you because they might tangentially include somebody who might face additional adversity in real life if so thats a pretty shit way to live your life
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats literally the joke though
ShitRedditSays,removed,only of the world is white unfortunately
ShitRedditSays,removed,timeout a secshould that not be something that is mentioned if youre dating someone or something the vibe im getting in this thread is that it shouldnt matter if theyre trans or not but you cant hold it against someone for wanting to know what theyre getting into i think people saying it should be the first thing they mention is ridiculous but it should be mentioned early on if a relationship is budding i dont see how thats entitlement
ShitRedditSays,removed,first of all trans is literally short for transition so yes it makes sense and second of all how is that so hard to understand
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think theres a huge difference between being transphobic and not being willing to date a trans person i swear the suffix phobic is losing its meaning
ShitRedditSays,removed,because someone might want to know if the person theyre interested in used to be a manwoman i dint think they should introduce themselves like that off the bat and anyone who does think that is ridiculous but its unfair to chastise someone for wanting to know if their potential so is trans yeah but its unfair to chastise someone for being trans yeah youre right but refusing to date someone because theyre trans isnt transphobic or rude everyone has their preferences
ShitRedditSays,removed,if someone jokes about race that doesnt make them racist jokes are just jokes stop taking everything so damn seriously lighten up a little sheesh
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyve got a real hardon for labeling things as racistsexist or not ill take the most ironic statements ive ever heard for alex
ShitRedditSays,removed,will someone explain to me how this is offensive its just a joke ive heard so much about this sub but was like meh they cant be that bad but goddamn its like nobody can joke about anything without you guys making an issue of it sure reddit is full of racist sexist assholes every huge website is but if reddit is so horrible why do you use the site honestly
ShitRedditSays,removed,thatsnot what i said at all but just because someone doesnt want to date a trans person that doesnt make them transphobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a fictional character from a video gamewho cares good lord
ShitRedditSays,removed,people with no senses of humor not understanding jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,just because someone doesnt want to date a trans person that doesnt mean they hate trans people or dislike them just because someone doesnt wanna date a black person that doesnt mean they dont like black people people have their preferences dude and theres nothing wrong with that you cant control who you arearent attracted to it doesnt work like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,say im a straight male and i want to date a straight female if they have a penis how is that not a reason to not date them and also in that context trans is short for transition
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt say it was funny im black myself but it was just a joke besides who cares what one person on reddit saysthinks
ShitRedditSays,removed,when you finally travel to the outside world you are going to find out that of normal people dont know what crazy third wave loon words actually mean
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe they just dont find them physically attractive how is that racist youre not obligated to find every person from every race attractive not being attracted to black people doesnt mean you dislike or hate black people or that you wouldnt be their friends it just means youre not physically attracted to them sure i bet a lot of people who refuse to date blacks are racist but that doesnt mean they all are
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just got back from spending a month in china and ive gotta say that they drive like maniacs over there i realize that this post generalizes a whole group of people but i really dont think its that bad obviously a joke and based on a pretty true stereotype i dont think any of the chinese people i know would be offended by it in the slightest cab drivers would often laugh when they could tell how stressed out their driving was making me
ShitRedditSays,removed,tests are based on white middleclass standards what a fucking liberal argument if blacks and latinos score lower its because the test was racist math english logic dont care about your racist or is this quote saying middle class standards require intelligence while black and latinos dont
ShitRedditSays,removed,because they arent normal you assume a car takes gas because that is normal and if its diesel someone will tell you when describing it

ShitRedditSays,removed,dear lord i said it before so ill just quote myself i disagree with this sub on alot of things but one thing i agree with it on is that this joke is fucking old
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont get how the shes a fox is offensive i thought it was just saying she has a surprised reaction like a fox is there something i missed
ShitRedditSays,removed,may i legitimately ask what is wrong with this comment it is wrong to prevent anyone regardless of race from learning and that is the point i believe this comment was trying to make can someone please tell me what was so offensive
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought it was accepted that trans people are mentally ill gender dysmorphic i thought that transition was considered one form of treatment though that isnt for everyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this offensive im not trying to be patronizing i honestly want to know how this is found offensive
ShitRedditSays,removed,duh i go to the white male community to plan my oppressing of any one who wants to be off the gender binary

ShitRedditSays,removed,i could be wrong but my friend was showing me some of the shit she makes and she undeservingly passes well and my thought is that maybe shes cis but pretends to be trans to be more unique with her transphobia
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry to break the queef but haramhalal is used to opress women you know like all other religions
ShitRedditSays,removed,really every channel is a white channel
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah lets keep pushing that idea all whites in america dont deal with reality well
ShitRedditSays,removed,i understand that black lives do matter but only in the context that lives matter pushing a separate agenda furthers the divide
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you implying all black people are poor
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you know what its like in the third world because i do and i know many families that could not survive without their child working its easy to pass on moral judgment from your privileged lives but the world isnt perfect everywhere and some of us had to do what we needed to survive
ShitRedditSays,removed,pussy slapping intensifies
ShitRedditSays,removed,so the sins of the father warrant the possible killing of children who had no input yet on the system of that time thats really awful logic frederick douglas did not kill children and his actions were far more reaching than turners tubman and truth also did not murder children fighting brutality with equaled brutality should not be celebrated or accepted in a modern society
ShitRedditSays,removed,and yet half the people here defend mulsims even though their prophet fucked a nine year old
ShitRedditSays,removed,when we talk about selfdefense in contexts of avoiding robbery or murder we dont use whatever steps the victim did or didnt take to prevent such a crime to justify the actions of the criminal hold on a minute here while im sure there is a small of people usually criminal types themselves who justify criminal acts the vast vast majority do not and im speaking of your examples of robbery and murder but if you think a middle class white dude ending up murdered in a dangerous neighborhood doesnt provoke thoughts and questions of what was he doing there in the first place he shouldnt have been in that place to begin with youre delusional every question gets asked and usually is answered with an assumption they were there to buy drugs at no point does any sane person justify what happened with that except the small of assholes who think any potential drug connection of any sort is grounds for dismissing all concern or think it makes what a killer or robber did ok nope they want the perpetrator punished fully and blame them for their actions
ShitRedditSays,removed,but if you dont immediately tell me that youre trans the second you meet me you deserve to be beaten to death
ShitRedditSays,removed,imma copy that disclaimer every time i hint at something racist from now on blaaacks amirite edited to add a really really important might i dont want to pretend its okay to have sex with blacks swearsies am i doing it right
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh humor can come in many flavors it can be biting satire a pie in the face dramatic irony or making light of the macabre of course its always possible to take things too far and the darwin awards thing seems a little haughty and therefore in poor taste not to mention the too soon factor were only generations removed from the whole widespreadeugenics thing that cost so many people their lives and bodily integrity but gallows humor in general is all right
ShitRedditSays,removed,bonus shit even people in srs dont give a shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,this thread has been targeted by a possible downvotebrigade from members of participating in this thread ★ i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals albert einstein ★

ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think he is black and if he is he is self hating i feel bad for self hating people
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry to break the queef but if gender really is a social construct and we do completely abolish notions of gender what happens to transfolk and their identity as in if theres no gender to transition to anymore surgically or otherwise will transmen and transwomen still be trans or will transness is that a word be more focused on physical appearance im sorry if this is an insensitive question im really really not trying to be im just struggling to understand and havent found any good resources so any guidance would be very much appreciated i want to be the best ally i can be

ShitRedditSays,removed,terrorism targets innocent civilians when police are militarized they cease to be civilians when they deny the reasonable will of the people and excuse themselves of murder they are not innocent who are they trying to scare the people no they are trying to scare the state not terrorism in my book

ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a bit dramatic dont you think ohwait i forgot what sub i was in carry on
ShitRedditSays,removed,sometimes people make jokes about morally unjust things because they are funny to them not to insult others the song is vulgar on purpose to be funny not to convey a serious message people dont laugh because they agree with it they laugh because it is an obviously morally wrong thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpiimgurcomiibsodmjpg
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you people are stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,well they were a government had an executive branch cabinet a legislative branch judicial and hell the even had a post system that to me is a government im glad that they did not make reconstruction more harder for them remember the treaty of versailles that didnt turn out too well
ShitRedditSays,removed,¯ツ¯
ShitRedditSays,removed,because this subreddit is the most hateful place on reddit ive been here for maybe ten minutes and ive seen more deleted comments than rnews has the moderators banning and removing posts simply because they dont agree with them this is censorship arrogance and bigotry srs will not be featured and why should it be
ShitRedditSays,removed,now thats what i call tolerance
ShitRedditSays,removed,many of us have had to seek therapy for ptsd since leaving im sure soldiers who have seen their friends blown up can relate
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you for proving my point instead of providing a meaningful response you instead insulted me because youre incapable of saying something anything worthwhile congratulations

ShitRedditSays,removed,hillary defends rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,feminazis dont go to school they wait trying to marry a rich guy for his money
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont see anything wrong with this having a shitty job doesnt mean you have ptsd it just means you made poor life choices
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does rpussypassdenied have anything to do with a punk getting what he deserves more importantly why arent you on tumblr
ShitRedditSays,removed,implying i wasnt good before

ShitRedditSays,removed,where in that comment did they say they want a straight relationship sounds like strawman to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit i have been in software for years and did very little of this where is this i want in
ShitRedditSays,removed,i burnt my toast this morning where can i get ptsd counselling this vulgar abuse of the term ptsd really grinds my gears people discussing ideas opening rubs your sjw sensibilities the wrong way yeah thats exactly like witnessing a dozen of you family members get hacked to death by machetes in a warzone
ShitRedditSays,removed,could me haz band right dis instance better
ShitRedditSays,removed,repeatedly being asked if im in salesproduct managementux and being told you dont look like a normal engineer you can take that one of ways a compliment most likely from a socially challenged male software engineer attempting to convey that you are awesome or be a cunt and pretend that this is somehow insulting and triggering why must people choose to interpret stuff in an intellectually dishonest manner just to profess victimization
ShitRedditSays,removed,diversityprivilege
ShitRedditSays,removed,life so hard the horrors
ShitRedditSays,removed,they just dont care they really dont uspez can sit up on a pedestal and talk about accountability and transparency but its just that talk they do not have the team to police the site and the ones that do go on a casebycase basis on what they decide is a legitimate issue or not maybe the only solution is to post the personal information of ulordvinyl and ugaazda and other admins give them a little taste of their own medicine when they ask for people to stop we just say is it against the rules of the subbreddit can you have this person contact me directly
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know that kind of work so im not going to judge but its kind of hard to grasp the idea of working for a website that gave you mental illness and distress
ShitRedditSays,removed,this subreddit will honestly be responsible for the election of president trump i was a bernie supporter and would never vote trump in a million years but the sjw trollish impish hordes have made liberals democrats some of them not me flock to the don because of your safe space nonsense its absolutely true meanwhile instead of electing bernie angry ignorant minorities voted for hillary for fuck knows why god knows she doesnt give a fuck about them or minorities i believe in democracy but a vote for hillary was a vote for trump shes way less electable in the general than bernie was and trump facefucking her in the polls now is evidence of that the sjw movement this angry raging board is responsible for the rise and popularity of donald trump you ran so far in the pc direction that now trump is slightly closer to the average mainstream voter than your ridiculous views are just pointing that out trump has a better than chance of winning in november now the blm movement in its current form like it or not is a giant vote trump advertisement to every white person in this country like it or not get them the fuck off the tv i agree with the movement but its methods and chaos and fuckritrol has tainted it already its now a trump ad on repeat the blm movement
ShitRedditSays,removed,well you indeed need therapy for childlike behaviour grow up
ShitRedditSays,removed,i want to see how long this stays up before anyone looks through my posts
ShitRedditSays,removed,does that have anything to do with her vagina i would argue that in fact that does have a lot to do with the fact she has a vagina
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is every comments upvotes in the negative
ShitRedditSays,removed,just just minorities but all hillary voters didnt know what was best for them instead of voting for bernie who may not be great but is at least electable they voted for a and get this im planning to vote democrat here one of the biggest sack of shit lying corrupt establishmentwithacapitale wallstreetblowing sycophantic lairs in fucking history they should have considered actually electing something with charisma rather than just picking hillary to say nanner nanner our pony won the democratic mantle and will now be slaughtered in the general we the dems picked a dumpy loser ive watched many of the republican and democratic debates this year hillary will get absolutely schlonged in the debates even if the facts and issues are on her side she will get absolutely schlonged just saying her supporters this board it led to president trump everyone who voted for hillary and this message board shot themselves in the foot so did blm they took direct action that led to the worst possible political results for themselves thats a fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,as with my own comment its mostly directed at the grandma like muslims and i personally dont see the srs part or the fact that our extremely religious basically old people are like what we get in rforwardsfromgrandma whatever floats your boat nonetheless you could take it differently
ShitRedditSays,removed,the first part is right there is no pay gap women in their make more than men in the same field education and qualification
ShitRedditSays,removed,nice try utrueeaglelibrarian but the response to your post says it all
ShitRedditSays,removed,witnesses including in the car at the time of said allegations said that there was no crime committed of course we need to see what unfolds but the user was going on if he did not in fact lay a hand on her if he did he deserves to not play and flip burgers for the rest of his life
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think black people should be gunned down in the streets and that we have a big police problem however the movement also comprised of sadly bonafide idiots and kill whitey racists which taint the overall message and make them a laughing stock to the mainstream not to mention ignorant professional victims that interrupted a rally for orlando to lambast the crowd call them racists and start spewing blm facts calling a crowd fucking racists their coup de grace usually does not win hearts and minds in fact is creates divides and empowers racists on both sides that is now the legacy of parts of blm the fact that any old crazy fuck can claim to be part of blm isnt helping matters for them
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just here so i wont get fined
ShitRedditSays,removed,your lack of perspective is amazing teenagers both black and white were responsible for this that tells us that the word in question doesnt have nearly the same meaning to them as it does to sjws like yourself that is progress correct it was also completely relevant to the discussion at hand
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not saying your politics are wrong im just saying if you prefer president donald j trump to bernie sanders then you were absolutely correct to vote for hillary clinton since it looks like its giving the donald his best possible chances dons republican platform is the most antigay fuckthepoor platform in republican history even moreso than mitt romney his vp mike pence believes in electroshock therapy for curing the gay outta you if that is your political stance i do think its wrong and a poor choice for this country thats why i wished you understood game theory voting for a dumpy loser who is now tied and in my opinion will soon be losing to donald trump was a poor strategic decision if you believe in climate change believe in minority rights and equal opportunity are against electroshock therapy of gays and banning them for restaurants
ShitRedditSays,removed,you should quit kfc
ShitRedditSays,removed,that comment wasnt against women that comment was against discrimination based on gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets not lump me in with them it is illegal to do this in the uk gordon brown made sure of it
ShitRedditSays,removed,nonmothers make the same as men its the mothers with the pay gap dumb shits
ShitRedditSays,removed,can someone find a comparison of hour to hour pay between women and men not yearly salary but hourly i cant find any online id love to know the truth because that is a valid thing to say i have always believed there was a pay gap and if you look at yearly it is true but id love to look at the averages for hourly
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is downvoted so much by feminists that need to fuck themselves with a knife
ShitRedditSays,removed,this subreddit is pure fucking cancer fucking sjwsfeminists just over the top liberalleftist propaganda and indoctrination
ShitRedditSays,removed,of all rapists in america are white men
ShitRedditSays,removed,i read the article because it takes place in a public area it is allowed
ShitRedditSays,removed,rgoldredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean i agree that the bible views feminism as sinful but i also think the bible is garbage
ShitRedditSays,removed,christian terrorism isnt an issue we dont really have a christian isis chopping the heads of people now do we
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are hundreds of millions of nonwhite christians
ShitRedditSays,removed,there have been a lot of false flag hate crimes exposed lately as well heres a comprehensive list for anyone who doubts it httpwwwfakehatecrimesorg
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i really dont get that whole islamaphobia thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only thing worse worse than white women are white men
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds pretty reasonable
ShitRedditSays,removed,sources
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you want terrorist attacks because this is how you encourage terrorists attacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,top make no mention of religion and a sovereign citizen is not the same as a hate group do you have any idea how easy it is to e put on a govt list of potential terrorism literally being patriotic gets you put on the lists so this doesnt really say anything
ShitRedditSays,removed,i understood op as saying christian terrorist groups get away with attacks while other religions do not thus i showed the source as faulty and explained what the site they linked doesnt actually have much to do with anything we are talking about if that seems to be goalpost moving then that was not my intention and if i misunderstood the op then i will be happy to change my posts
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill protect you my little brown buddy s heh just kidding
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you saying that this is an alt account or the other guy is
ShitRedditSays,removed,ut you havent given me any facts besides saying im a concern troll whatever that is and the fact this thread was near front page this morning would explain a casual user so which is it am i a troll or do you have no facts
ShitRedditSays,removed,just another white person in internet blackface pushing for black erasure
ShitRedditSays,removed,what do you mean main character you see the man for less than minutes mate at the very beginning of the game non of the war stories have anything to do with eachother
ShitRedditSays,removed,its sickening to me that transgenderism has not yet become normalized in communities like rmotorcycles they should be ashamed considering their massive transportation privilege
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok whats your point
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know its anecdotal but i have never once encountered anybody in real life who proclaimed anything resembling the haes movement and every example of it online could have easily been trolling i have a strong feeling that like usual redditors want to be mad about something so they choose something that either doesnt exist or has almost no real following
ShitRedditSays,removed,my theory because historically their normal has been riding off of the backs of minorities and women to them it seems normal and now theyre crying and bitching when real equality comes of course there are plenty of good people out there its just that good people tend to have morals and a moderate voice whereas people like this are fucking morons tldr for this long post white boy dont like it when his black neighbor suddenly competes with him for his job and cries reverse racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,serious question what is it you disagree with about the comment seems justified to me that he would be deported maybe im not realizing something
ShitRedditSays,removed,i still dont know what to say its a masterpiece
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean i see them hating on mothers who think everything is about them and their kids i didnt see any hate towards all women in general
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre allowed to be a woman and be annoyed with the bullshit that dumb people say woman does not always equal mother
ShitRedditSays,removed,she barely reacts using inane text speak its not about her not worshiping the wang its about her coming off with all the personality of a used napkin
ShitRedditSays,removed,its just a word and has as much power over you as youre prepared to give it if you dont tolerate certain language from others than you damn sure better not tolerate from yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,im pretty sure thats a borat quote
ShitRedditSays,removed,bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,removed,what point is this being a reasonable human being
ShitRedditSays,removed,not what i said at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,its something i consider one of my hobbies exactly like most gamers its a hobby nothing more that was literally my point i have no idea why you had to go all neckbeard waaa
ShitRedditSays,removed,how fucking petty can you get if youre swiss really fucking petty
ShitRedditSays,removed,people read that and thought holy fuck thats messed up and upvotedit because thats what the post was about this subreddit is so damn funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,so leave or do you thrive on butthurt
ShitRedditSays,removed,like this subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol wut objection your honor relevancy
ShitRedditSays,removed,but isnt that exactly the same meaning behind what he said you dont choose your gender your predisposed to one
ShitRedditSays,removed,black people are more bigoted and less supportive towards the lgbt community than white people by a mile
ShitRedditSays,removed,must say im honor to be featured here but before the outcry regarding my commentunderstand the context men in china are expected to own a car house high paying job and to figures cash for dowry as a min requirement for marriage and acceptance by girls folks yes there are some without those requirements but their society shaped them to believe its the requirement just like in west due to social pressure and marketingwe must buy diamond engagement rings that are month salary its the expected social norm if unable to provide society looks down on both partiesmen and female just like in west if we buy a cheap engagement ring bride to be looked down by her peers groom gets shiet from everyone else with chinas one child policy and traditional favoritism of boys over girlsmen outnumber females by you would think females have their pick of the litter and all women who wants to marry canbut its not we have women who want to marry but end up mateless due to their social pressure women actually holds all the cards in marriage now over there its up to the men to impress them problem is majority of chinas men are still impoverish by western earning standards they cant afford the cs cash condo car carats and believed the social norm they must have the chinese women now more educated then previous generations also buys into the perceived social norm and to maintain their hard fought improved social status simply refuses to marry down or in other cases the folks refuse to lower social status bc since females are in demand they want to wait for the best possible deal even if it means their girl goes unmarried chinese guys who cant afford said simply give up even attempting to talk the women they cant successfully marry down the road and instead focus their attention on women below their perceived grade nowdo i blame the womenno i simply blame the social norm that created this if reverse shortage of men in china it will be the men refusing to marry below their social status thus due to infanticide gender favoritism and etcmarriage is extremely difficult for all in china and no one is willing to marry below their social status unless something gives be it social norms standards etc marriage rates will decline in china for all sexes
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive never met a single egalitarian who cared about equality most just want to hit women because equality bitch
ShitRedditSays,removed,young men get sexually frustrated and say dumb things its just a part of growing up
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not sure saying whites dont have empathy means the same thing as cis people dont have empathy like those sound like two different statements to me the first one seems like it would be more relevant to a thread where we were discussing redditors huge racism problem whereas this is a thread where were discussing redditors huge transmisogyny problem the two overlap but theyre not synonymous
ShitRedditSays,removed,privileged person reddit all jackets matter
ShitRedditSays,removed,rest in peace young harambo
ShitRedditSays,removed,not really though one is not born as a gender one has to actively constitute themselves as that gender gender does not exist in an imaginary presocial context it only has meaning when individuals are placed into a specific social context and actively assign gender for a practical purpose ie the reproduction of the patriarchy this doesnt mean that its an individual choice either but even if it was we would not abandon our goal of lgbt liberation etc as our choices are limited by the contours in which we are immersed but in the final analysis the masters of whether or not gender has meaning are those who give it meaning and hence we can overcome it
ShitRedditSays,removed,im really surprised to see such matteroffactness about the is gender a choice debate from srs of all places ive always been of the mind that deeming gender identity something youre born with through dysphoria and such actually harms the notion that gender is just a social construct and that people shouldnt be forced into one category there are people out there who would call themselves trans but believe they changed their gender entirely through choice if i invalidated them as not being authentic for saying that id kind of just feel like a redditor complaining about biotroofs
ShitRedditSays,removed,im ok with this why are you all such insufferable liberals
ShitRedditSays,removed,i aint goin no where mate this statement is true
ShitRedditSays,removed,you a few pronouns xdd lel
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait wasnt the kid white
ShitRedditSays,removed,from what im understanding but hes still kinda wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,mods are such garbage i made an effort post detailing massive transphobia in rchristianity including shit like and it was removed for not being a circlejerk even though i had a tower of comments just like that only because i included about low voted ones the fempire is way too happy to defend religion and its disgusting
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know i find it kind of ironic how this sub takes a heavy stand against racism all while discriminating white men yourselves i just cant take this sub seriously since most of you are just as bad as all the the other racists on this site
ShitRedditSays,removed,if he reaches in the polls and makes it into the national debates then he actually has a chance hes at and most people either havent heard about him or have no clue what his views are
ShitRedditSays,removed,her is more dead now
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think he is making the subject of gender more black and white than it truly is
ShitRedditSays,removed,and again more racism against white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets not make fun people because of race fuck white peoplefuck white men the shit that is said in this subreddit is almost as bad as all the shit thats mocked
ShitRedditSays,removed,perhaps porn coupled with masturbation your critical eye kinda dims with dick in hand
ShitRedditSays,removed,when i wrote the comment it was intended to be heterosexuality homosexuality and bisexuality
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont you think thats a little offensive towards us europeans to put us all in to a group like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,people when they reach a certain population are a threat to themselves in ad a war in china killed approximately million people no white people were involved to claim that race changes someones nature is surely racist in itself
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry i dont know what a victim complex is however if i said all africans were barbaric backwards people that would be considered racist surely how come its not racist to claim similar things against europeans
ShitRedditSays,removed,popular opinion rindia mods should be subjected to the worst tortures known to man and publicly executed
ShitRedditSays,removed,biologically human women give birth to children and become a mother wtf kinda drugs are yall taking 😂 and yes adopters are still mothers but thats just technicality
ShitRedditSays,removed,uh oh your comment deeply triggered some manbabies who are now brigading you
ShitRedditSays,removed,you wanna check
ShitRedditSays,removed,the person was being sarcastic
ShitRedditSays,removed,islam isnt a race last time i checked right
ShitRedditSays,removed,meh its a hindu religious symbol its still widely used in india and is even a hindu first name google search for people named swastik imo it shouldnt be seen like that anymore
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is this meme posted odd submission
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you know a black guy didnt make it its just like the spooky memes
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs is a weird place
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are a few examples of transgendered people who look as attractive as him that such a crazy high bar to try and set shes goddamn beautiful like ofc most trans women wont be that attractive most cis women arent
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait dat boi is racist aww man i thought it was kind of cute i swear im not trying to sea lion but whats racist about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you realize that at some point your regurgitated copypastas become white noise that you become a parody of yourself that nobody except the small percentage of people who choose to have a presence on a site they loathe could take you seriously i hope you get the assists youre looking for seems like a waste of time otherwise
ShitRedditSays,removed,tyty
ShitRedditSays,removed,smirks to himself smugly
ShitRedditSays,removed,i presume hope your living status is extinct jk no not really jk i actually hope your kind becomes extinct
ShitRedditSays,removed,you may throw rocks at me but i think this one comment was legitimately funny terrorism jokes are funny no matter the color of the suicide bomber some of them are white cisgender muslim europeans
ShitRedditSays,removed,never bc people dont want to say each others pronouns
ShitRedditSays,removed,emotionallystunted white men who grew up in online echo chambers for bigotry thank god for black and middle eastern me oh wait
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets blow this completely out of proportion first you expect me to respect someones personal preference next youll be burning straight white men at the stake
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats the problem with this statement supposed to be
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think i understand where this guys is coming from at years old boys were awesome and girls had cooties that was the end of it i had no interest in sex or the idea of gender identity that stuff all comes later if this kid is openly trans at years old theres a good chance that those ideas were imparted on him by their parent or someone else close and the kid felt like they had to make a choice if those imparted ideas result in the child making lifechanging decisions before they really have no idea whats going on then yes i also believe there is something wrong with the person imparting those ideas kids are kids not men or women
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats arguable but i think the poster was more referring to the general cargo cultery than specifically saying all the outcomes are known in advance
ShitRedditSays,removed,if your outcomes are predetermined you are not doing science and this fact is no less true in sociology than it is in biology most natural scientists would say that if youre youre doing sociology youre not doing science if that is too specific a reason for you consider that you know exactly what the poster meant with their original metaphor i took it as meaning social science was a mere parody of science not specifically that the outcomes were known in advance
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not seeing anyone saying that its worse than female mutilation espexially not the majority just people saying that circumcision is stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,if they would say this they would be factually incorrect i disagree but thats hardly the point that most natural scientists statistic still has brown smears on it from where you pulled if out of your ass its hardly a statistic its a simple observation drawn from extensive personal experience social science is widely regarded as a joke among scientists so clearly since you do understand the problem with the original statement as ive told you i dont
ShitRedditSays,removed,im saying most people regardless of gender arent that attractive
ShitRedditSays,removed,i still feel like youre more likely to use a persons name when talking about the than a pronoun to me deadnaming is a bigger and more common dick move than pronoun usage but both happen
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre transparents
ShitRedditSays,removed,im pleased youre having fun but id like to point out that provides the context of the quote you are having a hard time with ie i was responding to a slight exactly the same way you are also i aced all my science classes cheers
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats productive
ShitRedditSays,removed,it means that your recipe is false
ShitRedditSays,removed,thatd end really well for you im sure
ShitRedditSays,removed,its all fun and games until it comes to getting your dick split and shoved inside you
ShitRedditSays,removed,being a loving caring and supportive parent is obviously important but what other life changing decisions would you leave in the hands of an year old id say let them be the person they want to be as long as they dont take hormones or anything that would change their body permanently you wouldnt say its ok for and year old to get a tattoo or decide they want to pick up smoking because those are decisions you would trust a fully developed mind with once you hit do whatever you like
ShitRedditSays,removed,can confirm
ShitRedditSays,removed,because they dont want to on average most women prefer human serviceshealtheducation which pay less wage gap
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah but think about how white people feel its like you want segregation back
ShitRedditSays,removed,i kinda want to hit this guy
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you dont want peoples opinions i would advise you stay off the internet
ShitRedditSays,removed,i do think every rape claim should be investigated but they arent wrong you cant just convict people on a claim evidence is needed and can be very hard to obtain i think that a lot of reddits stance is either the accused rapist is automatically already guilty and the other stance is the accuser is a liar who is already guilty that is not how our system works and neither of those outcomes can be said to be true without evidence
ShitRedditSays,removed,almost certain that this is satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you know where you are
ShitRedditSays,removed,almost drowned in her pussy so i swam to her butt
ShitRedditSays,removed,you should be thankful im taking this knife out of your gut i mean yeah i put it there in the first place the people who freed the slaves were not the ones who made them slaves to begin with
ShitRedditSays,removed,blacks have a worse segregation strategy than whites and dolphins am i doing this right
ShitRedditSays,removed,you post this every fucking thread stahhp
ShitRedditSays,removed,not always youre assuming that the identity of the perpetrator is known theres a world of difference between are you sure you were raped and are you sure this person raped you and studies have repeatedly shown that eyewitness testimony even from the victims of any type of violent crime is unreliable suggesting that the victim wasnt raped at all is inexcusable but in cases of stranger rape or where the victim was not fully conscious the possibility of misidentifying the attacker is absolutely a factor
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats wrong with being proud of your race
ShitRedditSays,removed,come on it was clearly a joke who would be attracted to a politician haha
ShitRedditSays,removed,not unless he wanted a chance of getting an std is that girl a vietnamese prostitute
ShitRedditSays,removed,was not aware mexican currency had pedophilic tendencies
ShitRedditSays,removed,because no females have ever done anything wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah because straights get parades and doritos bags in their honor
ShitRedditSays,removed,huh
ShitRedditSays,removed,but if you being serious the most ive tried is
ShitRedditSays,removed,no they didnt blacks were already slaves before europeans bought them
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes blacks are both of those being arrested by police and of those shot by police
ShitRedditSays,removed,its completely fine to be proud of your race this is a weird post
ShitRedditSays,removed,the reason there are separate categories for men and women is because men would not survive when women would inevitable beat their asses in every discipline
ShitRedditSays,removed,so much white guilt in this thread honestly maybe you guys should commit suicide so there will be fewer white oppressors it would be for a good cause
ShitRedditSays,removed,bill clinton is a rapist
ShitRedditSays,removed,did someone get triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a shitty thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a mtf mma fighter who almost fucking killed his opponent its a thing and a fucking idiocy
ShitRedditSays,removed,reeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not understanding this legitimately looking to learn
ShitRedditSays,removed,links
ShitRedditSays,removed,reactionary liberal scum hillary clinton is basically hitler
ShitRedditSays,removed,tell us about all the other races who voluntarily ended the slavery they practiced oh wait you cant
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was so long ago why are you still upset right when are the spanish getting reparations for the islamic occupation of iberia am i doing this right
ShitRedditSays,removed,but just wow just wow does he even know its the current year
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh my fucking god some people really are massive fuckwits yeah its completely untrue what an idiot how can anyone think white people freed american slaves does he think there was some kind of civil war in which half a million white union soldiers died fighting the confederacy or something and then freed all american slaves when they won clearly that never happened fucking cis white male scum i cant even
ShitRedditSays,removed,do we have to throw the irish under the bus yeah theyre usually irrelevant in these discussions but they went through some shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh no he said retard this sub is going to shit because of retarded posts like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,you not liking a joke doesnt mean its not a joke i laughed at the whole conversation thanks for linking it to me btw
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know why this shouldnt count as brigading but whatever actors are not paid because how hard they work or how many dialogues they have they are instead paid based on how successful and popular they are and she didnt convince that she was important to the show and thus deserved a raise instead she threatened to accuse them of sexism they basically gave her a raise to prevent a pr nightmare kevin spacey is one of the greatest actors of our age frankly the number of actors who could demand fees as high as his without being laughed out of the room is vanishingly small i found her demands to be sheer hubris even objectively spacey has two oscars she doesnt even have two nominations i have no problem with her negotiating a contract why would i i just dont think she deserves to be paid same as his simply because she is his female co lead
ShitRedditSays,removed,i find my argument very cohesive actually as a professional she isnt spaceys equal therfore she doesnt deserve the same pay to suggest she was short changed because of her gender instead of merit is a huge disservice to everyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,an empty reply
ShitRedditSays,removed,the i cant see anything there is that supposed to mean something
ShitRedditSays,removed,have a source for me
ShitRedditSays,removed,that cant be a real term
ShitRedditSays,removed,just pointing out that whites are more than of the population so the rapist statistics doesnt prove your point
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont really like her tbh postmodernism irritates me still a horribly racist post though
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fairpeople make fun of every candidateabout different thingsincluding trumps small hands correlating to having a small penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh wow oh wow this is so offensive it makes fun of a uniquely feminine body part and is there fore sexist wow
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes and the only reason they are alive is because they live in western countries surrounded by people who arent muslims
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry i forgot that just because i dont support a horrible manipulative corrupt politician means that im a misogynist shut the fuck up
ShitRedditSays,removed,he wasnt unapologetic but other than that yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,im confused why this is under shit reddit says is there some context to this because this seems like a fairly normal statement really
ShitRedditSays,removed,transgender is a mental illness it is called gender dysphoria claiming that a bunch of people with a suicide rate about that of the background population who want hormonal therapy and surgery which has ill note never even been scientifically demonstrated to be helpful above placebo to help cope with their problem arent mentally ill is just bizarre im not feminist im egalitarian a lot of people dont want to be associated with the modern feminist movement because the crazy fuckers who are in it now have ruined the word and they dont want to be seen as agreeing with them it is understandable it is also worth remembering that feminism has no single definition less conservative rightwingers i understand a lot of people dont know what the word liberal means but the word liberal has nothing to do with being leftwing or rightwing it has to do with being in favor of civil liberties liberals are in opposition to authoritarians people who are opposed to civil liberties in the name of creating a more x society the aclu is an example of a liberal organization a lot of people get confused because people often misuse the term liberal to mean leftist because for some time in the us a lot of liberals were leftists but in reality the two arent the same thing communists are leftists but not liberals likewise people who are opposed to a lot of economic and social regulations are liberals but they arent leftists justice thomas for all his conservatism tends to vote consistently on the side of freedom of speech which is a liberal position the citizens united decision at the supreme court was a liberal decision
ShitRedditSays,removed,being socially liberal is about being in favor of civil liberties like freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of religion ect all sensible people are in favor of minimal government interference with our lives the question generally speaking is what defines minimal as some level is necessary to avoid bad things happening segregation ect to people who are fiscally liberal ie opposed to government regulation of and intervention in personal economic matters government interference in private business is largely a bad thing because it decreases individual liberty if you arent free to start up a new shop or operate a business the government is repressing you in a very real way work is something we spend a great deal of time doing and taking away someones financial independence severely curtails their ability to live their life the way that they want to indeed it was financial independence which lead to democracy and the industrial revolution and liberalism and pretty much everything we consider to be good in modern society the idea that the ability to do business for yourself to operate your own business as you see fit to have control over your own economic life are all tied to freedom is very obvious and is one of the founding principles of the us the main argument amongst sensible people is the level of economic regulation necessary to ensure that the economy does not behave in a suboptimal or abusive manner and what level of intervention is necessary to keep markets as free as possible as you need protections against abusive monopolistic practices and similar things socialists people on the far left are quite authoritarian and are generally opposed to personal liberties they dont see themselves as such of course but they are in reality they dont understand that freedom includes the freedom to do things that other people disapprove of or that make people angry theyre collectivists and consequently see people saying things that they disagree with as bad and something to be made illegal and try to silence people who disagree with them
ShitRedditSays,removed,epic memes fellow srsers i havent seen these before
ShitRedditSays,removed,will someone stand up for the nazis
ShitRedditSays,removed,sargon of akkad literally the biggest fucking idiot on youtube name any other youtuber and hes less intelligent by a mile the white genocide people dumber freemen on the land dumber fucking true forced loneliness conspiracy theorists who think lizard people are stealing the worlds women and that the earth is flat dumber
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree with not mocking people for being overweight its not particularly helpful to anyone i dont think its necessary to be contrarian and ignore medical facts and tell people its perfectly okay to be obese though
ShitRedditSays,removed,to them who is them
ShitRedditSays,removed,pardon what does that mean
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont concern myself with whats considered a healthy lifestyle if youre very overweightobese youre at a higher risk for diabetes heart disease etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,i called the comment out expressing shock that it was so highly upvoted at the time and got grief for it sigh
ShitRedditSays,removed,ecks dee racism how clever ecks dee
ShitRedditSays,removed,in your opinion im guessing
ShitRedditSays,removed,what do you mean
ShitRedditSays,removed,pardon explain more
ShitRedditSays,removed,islamophobes who is an islamophobe i oppose anyone or any creed whose fundamental beliefs is that anyone should be treated as a second class citizen or that people should be killed for something they cannot change something inherent to their person like their gender sexuality race etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,then he aint a real muslim then i guess you havent read the koran or hadiths or familiar with early islamic history its jumble of contradictory sometimes violent sometimes peaceful essentially nonsense it was thrown together sometime years after the death of that nasty misogynistic child molesterer to explain why and how the arabs got the better of persians and romans it was actually the early medieval equivalent of a total war that exhausted each other and religious uprisings by both jewish people and various heretical christian groups in roman empire and zoroastrian heretical groups in persia any strong or determined people could have calved up the empires of those people it just happened to be protomuslims it was more surprising that they survived so long
ShitRedditSays,removed,the quran chapter annisa verse men have authority over women by what allah has given one over the other and what they spend from their wealth so righteous women are devoutly obedient guarding in absence what allah would have them guard but those from whom you fear arrogance advise them forsake them in bed and strike them but if they obey you seek no means against them indeed allah is ever exalted and grand — translated by abdullah yusuf ali chapter sūrat lbaqarah the cow verse your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth for yourselves and fear allah and know that you will meet him and give good tidings to the believers honestly there are dozens of these some hadiths are far worse
ShitRedditSays,removed,good little chav are you just trolling i have a ma degree in stats from a russell group university i vote for labour or liberal democrats i read the guardian youll be surprised just how many left wingers and liberals oppose islamism and mass migration
ShitRedditSays,removed,where did i defend the daily mail this is quite absurd argument just because you might disagree with me doesnt mean i am some sort of fascist or racist thats a pretty immature and poor argument
ShitRedditSays,removed,i find the term regressive left to be useful to me it would be used to describe that aspect of the progressive movement which holds that specific groups must be protected and honored hypothetical if i were to speak out against a native american for its polygamy the regressive left would accuse me white male of projecting my personal values on a subjugated group or even of just plain racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,again whats your point its not ok to be obese regardless of whether you can also be unhealthy in other ways
ShitRedditSays,removed,its really not theres a reason you wouldnt recommend it because its not ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,but thats not at all what happened he directly apologized for what he did
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not even strictly white and why should i matter that is very prejudicial and quite vile you sjws you seem to love bigotry and racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,one of the better ones and all of them are above average and seen as a marque of excellence amongst the most competitive higher education markets in the world
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is a stem lord and what is your problem with them
ShitRedditSays,removed,kind of odd coming from a forum where people also complain about things
ShitRedditSays,removed,everything youve said about obesity could be said about drunk driving
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres everything irrational about your arguments here you wildly jump from one insult to another with the slightest evidence in what you are saying you know its quite possible to separate a people from an ideology
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,all my favorite obese rappers comedians died young its not ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,that depends on your view of what the criminal justice system is meant to be if you think that it should prevent crime rehabilitate criminals and satisfy the need of the victim to feel taken care of then it was dealt with exactly harshly enough the victim is happy with the outcome zach jesse hasnt raped anybody else and theres no reason to believe he will the tough on crime view of the criminal justice system has been repeatedly shown to be harmful to suspects because it encourages false convictions harmful to law abiding citizens because its expensive to lock up people who dont need to be locked up and harmful to the criminal because it increases rates of recidivism so i guess if you would rather have a situation where we turned an irresponsible child who made a gigantic mistake into a hardened criminal who continued harming people and didnt turn out to be a good guy who contributes to society then youre right it wasnt a harsh enough punishment
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you have a source for that
ShitRedditSays,removed,it as in the tribe hence the nongender pronoun and i didnt present the case because im just creating a hypothetical for discussion by your response do i understand then that we could discuss if this were an actual situation the pros and cons of such a groups implications without having to tiptoe around the racial issues
ShitRedditSays,removed,its especially ridiculous since the difference between sanders and clinton politically is tiny and mostly concerned with strategy so like the soup of the day was chicken noodle instead of tomato so i poisoned the restaurants water supply
ShitRedditSays,removed,i provide evidence you start getting racist and then say i read the daily mail that is precisely how this happened i used the sjw because that what i presumed you were how would you describe your politics
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait understand my premise assume for a moment that polygamy is unacceptable im not prepared to debate that lets just say monogamy is an unalienable human right for the sake of discussion now if a native american tribe were to support polygamy said practice would be wrong regardless of the tribes historical status or any other precursors or history so the term regressive left might be a useful term to describe a thought process or a group which philosophically bends over backwards to tolerate that tribes unacceptable practice and i dont see it as a straw man if a group behaves in a way that is in violation of human rights we should address that behavior as needed we can debate what the appropriate action should be but we have to at least be able to discuss it
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah thats a good point like when somebody talks about how catholics should do this or catholics should do that i think yeah well what do you know or i cant find it in myself to say hey you low income black community you should do i was more to the point of say if a certain practice violates human rights we should be able to have a conversation about what might need to be done
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey check your vehicular privilege
ShitRedditSays,removed,you dont know if rape has affected him or not
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh those are some pretty hilarious jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,id say rey is a mary sue in tfa she effortlessly beat up two guys who were sent to rob her flew the millennium falcon despite having never done so before figured out how to release gas from it in order to knock people out saved finn from a rathtar released herself from physical restraints used a jedi mind trick despite never having done so before fought well with a lightsabre despite having never done so before she also didnt seem to have any personal flaws she was bland and adapted well to things to be fair she was captured by kylo at one point despite the things you mentioned luke is much less of a mary sue like you said he blew up the death star but look at what happened to him prior to that knocked out by tuskan raider had to be rescued nearly got into a fight in bar had to be rescued got trapped in a trash compactor had to be rescued hes also regularly spoken down to by han and a bit naive hes flawed the fact that he manages to turn things around towards the end dampens the idea hes a mary sue
ShitRedditSays,removed,i disagree princess leia is a strong female character central to the original trilogy
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously why are so many people here getting worked up over a shitty joke someone made on rjokes fucking chill out people
ShitRedditSays,removed,you are dishonestly misrepresenting why people think rey is a mary sue a bit she has all these​ traits and no real flaws you are even using as your example the literally one thing that is fine and well thought out about her character her hand to hand combat ability its not her fault though the writing in force awakens is so fucking shallow and boring while not as shockingly and bafflingly awful as the prequels it still has lots of um ok i guess thats a thing now and huh moments the writing in iv and v are just so good that its really hard to compare corporate garbage to them fairly
ShitRedditSays,removed,how am i supposed to get drunk and beat it at utc twistmental replied to im a florida man i cant have that shit how am i supposed to get drunk and beat it
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha lets normalize domestic abuse by making joaks about it maybe srs should pool our money together and back this virtual waifu thing so real women can be safe from predditors
ShitRedditSays,removed,get it everyone the hilarious joak is that he physically abuses his loved ones and he is lamenting that he cant assault something that is virtual ahahahahahafuckingkillmeahahahahaha
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a joke though even if its a bad one
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you are just going to assume someones gender sexual orientation and whether they are cistrans
ShitRedditSays,removed,selfawareness much
ShitRedditSays,removed,you put your dick in it thats how its a fucking machine you guys cry over this why not cry over my crusty socks or my fleshlight
ShitRedditSays,removed,who cares
ShitRedditSays,removed,get off of it then snowflake go outside and exercise your fat ass
ShitRedditSays,removed,why dont you get over yourself and lighten up youre going to die early from being so offended by everything
ShitRedditSays,removed,the real misandry
ShitRedditSays,removed,pedophilia means being attracted to children not acting upon it at least part of the sexual abuse against children is committed by people that arent pedophiles estimates vary on what proportion of offenders are pedophiles as much as or as low as in reply to anthroengineer on we need to treat it like a mental disease instead of the boogey man at utc britzer wrote pedophilia means being attracted to children not acting upon it you are correct in this assumption except that at least part of the sexual abuse against children is committed by people that arent pedophiles they arent attracted to children but rather sadistic or enjoy the power imbalance having total control over their victim the abuse is power play rather than sexual since sexual abuse is thought of as a very much underreported crime the estimates vary on what proportion of the offenders are pedophiles could be as much as or as low as
ShitRedditSays,removed,uh no if you commit sexual assault on anyone under the age of consent you are a rapist paedophile
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy fucking pedo apologia this pseudointellectual bullshit is the absolute worst of the apologia burn it all down and salt the fucking servers
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait if they arent pedos then what are they
ShitRedditSays,removed,i use toys for sex and when the technology of printing had advanced enough i will incorporate it into that aspect of my life the technology of robotics and artificial intelligence is no different i should not be stigmatized for that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i see the bigotry and sexshaming of people who want to include robots in their sex life but i honestly dont see how the joke that is the target of this post is bigotry im certainly open to the possibility that it is and im just missing it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i always found it odd how people would have sex or rape in this case someone that they arent attracted to people kept saying child molesters arent attracted to children then what driven them to molest children
ShitRedditSays,removed,just like with my abuser he wants to kill pedophiles and child killers yet he preys on year olds
ShitRedditSays,removed,your kinda wrong the space jesus aka the emperor is actually an atheist the cruel irony is that humans think of him as a god i think i know those human armies too death korps of kreig arent based on germans but french while yes the mordian iron guard and steel armageddon legion are actually based on the werchment them acting like nazis is completely false the mordian iron guard are basically the disciplined werchment soldiers of the reich with fancy uniforms while the steel legion mostly take on the german tank doctrine and infantry tactics fun fact in the steel armageddon legion lore they were actually going to get sent to death camps for fighting daemons so take that as you will as for space marines the black templars yes are in lore complete fucking lunatics and their symbol is of a cross but that is the entire point basically space marines themselves are mostly just war monks but the black templars arent hateful agasint humans another space marine chapter called the celestial lions and mind you these lions guys are actually african american space marines in lore and both chapters are absolute bros with one another other chapters of space marines like the salamanders arent that insane and actually care for human life so not all space marines are crazy religious zealots and for the slannesh part it looks like you fell for the memes slannesh isant about sex or rape hes mostly about excess of pleasure that could mean sexfood or anything you take pleasure in but being hes a chaos god the pleasure its taken to like say you really like a weapon slannesh will give you a way to be part of that weapon so you can feel the pain you inflict onto people in my opinion is an extremely diverse scifi setting since no one hates each other for the color of their skin or what planet they are from since humanity is united agasint alien threats there are so much armies based on various cultures and peoples its quite crazy about how much lore their is hell there is even an entire army of badass space nuns called the sisters of battle who can turn into literal angels and at the same time space marines cant do that you and rightwing people keep messing up lore while the real fans are forced to suffer as a cause becasue believe it or not the setting is actually fun also the fact that warhammer has a long and large following of it on
ShitRedditSays,removed,rekt
ShitRedditSays,removed,man you goofs cant take a joke smdh getting all rustled over nothing
ShitRedditSays,removed,we get it youre offended that penises exist and you need a space where you can avoid penis by constantly talking about penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,the emperor is turkish not white
ShitRedditSays,removed,fucking disgusting
ShitRedditSays,removed,well which ones it depends on the artist besides how is the emperor a garbage male power fantasy that title belongs to horus or gullimen
ShitRedditSays,removed,look at all of you wannabe intellectuals looking down your noses and condescending to everyone who thinks differently than you you people are pathetic
ShitRedditSays,removed,ban me
ShitRedditSays,removed,most gay pride events ive been at so you admit there is a fair share of degeneracy at some gay pride events youve been at
ShitRedditSays,removed,ugh cant females have a normal conversation without getting so emotional
ShitRedditSays,removed,typically reddit what is wrong with this website omg cant the poster be considerate because im a virgin and have chosen to live a sexless life
ShitRedditSays,removed,for columbine d
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a bad joke too hard to find the hole on a fatty
ShitRedditSays,removed,g
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean i think liberal feminists are pansies because they arent radical enough i guess ef is better than nothing but its nowhere near where we need to be and the right content that we want and should be shared
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is it pedophilia if he was also in high school
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i made a post in this thread hours ago and now im back so maybe
ShitRedditSays,removed,i really dont see what is so awful about this the girl was being awful against all effort of the teacher to correct the behavior and she wasnt injured by the boy who attacked her i think it would have been better to have a private conversation with the boy who attacked her but i dont see what is so bad about this situation
ShitRedditSays,removed,why
ShitRedditSays,removed,all men are disgusting creeps pls no
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why i dont let low paid low skill low class workers near my kids i sat next to future teachers in college one in particular wanted me to study buddy with her so she could achieve her life long dream of working with special needs students she rarely achieved a grade above c level and was googling porn while i was taking notes in lecture hubby makes good money and i can run my company from the home office two words if you care about your children home school
ShitRedditSays,removed,but that cant actually happen
ShitRedditSays,removed,why someone take notes for you while you slept through class because you were out with molly the night before and now you want to work with kids
ShitRedditSays,removed,people are getting drunk by a trash fire in the street some car nearly killed a guy on purpose and no one seemed that bothered and some hookers were naked out on the corner plus pretty much every store was a liquor store strip club or gun store that place would be fucking scary at night i would never go there why are you trying to compare this to a wealthy white neighborhood they are literally opposites in every way
ShitRedditSays,removed,its called equal rights
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre an idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,at first i was pretty convinced that the title was in fact referencing that the male cosplayer is depicting the protagonist in the phantom pain who isnt actually snake but a combat medic with memory loss though he thinks he is snake for most of the game buuuuut as i read through the comments i became decidedly less charitable in my interpretation of the post
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats it like to spend hours looking to get offended
ShitRedditSays,removed,pfft the vast majority are unwashed neckbeards summer aint gonna get their asses moving anywhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,much worse degrees excuse me but this is extremely questionable i have a physics degree and all people i studied with now have good jobs in engineering academia or software development well at least those who studied hard according to of paying degrees physics rated and phycology
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt a bunch of people like that little girl in the story that grew up and never got any kind of comeuppance for it
ShitRedditSays,removed,salary potential has nothing to do with job placement thats true this link is not really relevant i provided the only data that correlates with the quality of carrier in my mind that i was able to find in a few minutes if you have some evidence for phycology degree being more beneficial for job placement than physics degree i will be glad to see it all i can provide is anecdotal evidence from my experience and experience of dozens of people i studied with with knowledge in programming laboratory experiments electronics and statistics surprisingly physicists study mathematical statistics because its a basis for manyparticle physics and experiment results analysis one needs to try hard to not find a good job
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey phycology degree pays off at last just kidding
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre saying focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment and you post it here really
ShitRedditSays,removed,truuuuuuu
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha i live in chicago the city in this video is still fucked up chicago is a really nice place unless you happen to wander into one of our more diverse neighborhoods in the middle of the night even during the day shit goes down in those place around the clock something tells me most reddit users arent from riverdale or west englewood so stfu with your suburban garbage most cities arent literally shit holes everywhere and dont pretend that they nice places just because theyre all black replace all those people with white people and everyone here would make fun of it bc youre racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh isnt that good though in the past cops would assume that women cant do crimes and not arrest them but its changing its not like a rjusticeporn video of a woman getting hit or something
ShitRedditSays,removed,rshitredditsays were for the absolute liberation of women from others rshitredditsays criticizes cosplayer for being problematic and having unrealistic body standards you cant have your cake and eat it too i find the whole breathingthroughskin thing to be silly but let people do what they want if it doesnt directly attack someone else
ShitRedditSays,removed,only in exchange for a highquality psychotherapy
ShitRedditSays,removed,just a quick note the post is at and is hours old lets check back on it in hours or so
ShitRedditSays,removed,i genuinely dont understand whats wrong with this comment given its context
ShitRedditSays,removed,gingers are being replaced all the time now comic book companys and movie studios feel like they are easily disposable and replace them with nongingers gingers are bullied a lot and if representation truly matters this is a huge problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,read the context its an exmuslim reassuring a muslim woman who doesnt want to wear a hijab
ShitRedditSays,removed,til seeing a kid being beheaded shouldnt disgust people
ShitRedditSays,removed,he did specify that it was a generalization so i dont see why hes getting so much unneeded and unhinged rage i understand that people will feel a type of way regarding others who dont fit their own personal ideologies but this really doesnt need so much negative energy pointed at it especially on such a subjective topic
ShitRedditSays,removed,hijab is not always exactly patriarchal or sexist here in the west women and men as well are culturally expected to cover up so why do redditers criticize women in muslim culture when they do the same they just have different fashion norms and cultural norms as to what should be covered up but it probably makes as much sense as the norms of the west
ShitRedditSays,removed,is shaming rapists shit reddit says now
ShitRedditSays,removed,she is literally a rapist
ShitRedditSays,removed,well you know what fuck far people unless youre in my immediate vicinity i have no use for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds kind of like bisexuals
ShitRedditSays,removed,well of youre against free speech thats your problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,so is blm jk but seriously
ShitRedditSays,removed,it literally is by definition racist how is it not racist to assume someone is privileged based on their skin color
ShitRedditSays,removed,may have something to do with you defining a person by their skin color
ShitRedditSays,removed,at this point buzzword has become a buzzword keep circle jerking though
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt she a little bit overweight though not that theres anything wrong with that its her choice but if we look at humans in the past and humans as a whole now men included of course in america expecially the average body weight is definitely more while i am definitely against fat shaming of all kinds its almost as if maintaining a healthy active and nutritious lifestyle is seen as bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive never once heard a doctor say avoid cancer thats the dumbest fucking thing ive ever heard
ShitRedditSays,removed,mansplain is a buzzword
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously no one gives a fuck about being called a cis by a mentally ill idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,i meant in the bubble that is srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats an interesting article definitely worth thinking about that doesnt mean that staying in shape isnt a conscious decision you can make though beer chips and cookies while delicious definitely arent healthy and if you choose to overindulge thats fine and your choice but just because a lot of people do it now a days certainly doesnt mean its whats healthy
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,blm are right to protest when criminals lose gunfights that they start with the police
ShitRedditSays,removed,shut up fatty miles is nothing
ShitRedditSays,removed,thinking that it is okay to make fun of a group of people for not speaking the same way you do is racism plain and simple
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean thats a far stretch though shes not on the show unlike the book and certainly wasnt irl now the rest a weird mix of jokes with some potentially serious reply or two obviously advocating or enjoying rape let alone that of a little girl are horrible so its definitely not an acceptable fetish for male or female
ShitRedditSays,removed,im confused with your issue re grrm are you angry that rape is a thing that exists and as such is displayed in art or are you angry that rape is being depicted in art because this art happens to express how terrible a thing rape is its helping solidify and spread rape awareness
ShitRedditSays,removed,most women would also never date a redditor since they dont want to be date a misogynistic asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a chinese american who has been harassed and verbally abused for my ethnicity many times seeing such internalized racism makes me sick and angry
ShitRedditSays,removed,now im not trying to be mean but how much do you think it weighs was it too sexy for the venue or was there something else off putting
ShitRedditSays,removed,schumer was fine until she publicly shamed a minor for making her own joke to her youract yourfault beanadult
ShitRedditSays,removed,most men are disgusted by trannies sorry sweetie youll have to make do with steven the lbs hipster who plays dd
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think most healthy intelligent normal people have aversions to people with hormonal disorders and want to rip out their genitals but thats just me
ShitRedditSays,removed,why because they are medical terms used for classification of mental illness
ShitRedditSays,removed,when youre from china and are extremely offended at this bigotry and prejudice directed towards you
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah that doesnt make sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe its because the mexican community doesnt nearly have as much privilege as the white communities of the world and that making fun of them is punching down not up just a thought there
ShitRedditSays,removed,op here im northern irish therefore i am confident in the difference between banter and genuine ethnic discrimination growing up in an actual divided society the latter leads to gerrymandering and violence the former leads to me taking the piss out of you in return because im not so fucking thin skinned learn about nuance and stop striving to be offended by everything youre being extremely condescending towards mexicans by assuming they cant take a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand how age of consent laws set at are indicative of support of pedophilia
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you qualified to speak on every mexicans behalf either do you not think ive had encountered to lazy drunk irish stereotype before from english people i bat it straight back at them its the assumption of offence or racism that i take issue with your lot on thats everyones is this melting snowflake youre all up in arms about stereotypes jokes about mexican people but you dont give two shits if its about the french or greeks or the italian ive seen the clip i think it came across as perhaps mean spirited but clarkson hammon and may are continuously taking the piss out of countries race wasnt mentioned once not everyone wants to live in the bubble of extreme political correctness where people are afraid to make jokes because it might hurt someones feeling it is filled with negative national and cultural stereotypes does it offend me no because i can take a fucking joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not sure what the fuck this redditor is trying to say but whatever it is im sure that its something offensive and misogynistic
ShitRedditSays,removed,so instead of age of consent laws we should just have laws saying minors can only have sex with minors and majors can only have sex with majors
ShitRedditSays,removed,also lots of effort to come in here and brigade and argue for apparently being able to take a joke im one guy you linked my comment here i was notified of that in my inbox so of course im going to come and defend myself im not the one brigading here
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit making excuses for pedopphiles im not surprised disappointed and angry yes but surprised no
ShitRedditSays,removed,chinese people suck my pussy becuz i have a fetish for asians of all genders fuck you bitch cunt
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just asking guys please dont ban me or just answer me then ban me if like of muslims think being gay is unacceptable why do you always defend them they are the least politically correct
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt it technically called ephebophilia i mean the implications are roughly the same but still correct usage of terms and whatnot its pretty fucked anyway
ShitRedditSays,removed,doesnt this sub ban you for not blindly following its circlequeef
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know someone compared this subreddit to thedonald and i gotta say thats pretty much the killer counter argument
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you just assume my ethics s
ShitRedditSays,removed,how many men complain zero why because of people in the gym are there to mind their own business get their shit done and get out you know what the best defense against that is fucking ignore it not sitting at home complaining because things should be easy for you uryokoo should take his own advice and not worry about something that literally doesnt affect him also why is rcanada such a pouthouse do canadians just complain out of boredom since they dont produce any cultural output like the us does
ShitRedditSays,removed,or have two brain cells or more to rub together
ShitRedditSays,removed,try telling that to collegeuniversity liberals
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just came here for the negative karma
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol youre a shithead i had no clue why you were upset about slimgur how do you find joy in life with a stick so far up your racist ass
ShitRedditSays,removed,i followed you because i thought your username was dumb and wanted to see who you were ended up being pretty much what i expected i dont see how anyone in srs can be happy when they are always so mad at everything
ShitRedditSays,removed,its cute that you think im upset this subreddit sucks and i will happily enjoy downvotes i will enjoy both my block and my video gamez d
ShitRedditSays,removed,that comment did sound very much like a shill though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think youre talking my post out of context
ShitRedditSays,removed,dis me
ShitRedditSays,removed,former reddit ceo defends thedonald yeah theres no comparison i would have immediately fired anyone who did that in reply to spez on its fair ellen wasnt the first reddit engineer so she probably lacked the expertise to do it and even if she did she was smart enough to not at utc ekjp wrote yeah theres no comparison i would have immediately fired anyone who did that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sexually identify as beating a dead horse
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought they identified as attack helicopters
ShitRedditSays,removed,as someone who is against most safe spaces i can elaborate on what i have against them if youre genuinely interested if not please disregard the below safe spaces can be very useful where someone regularly faces high threat then giving them a place of threat is the humane thing to do the example i am talking of here is things like domestic abuse victims having spaces where there abuser and other abusers cannot enter however not all safe spaces are like this some are echo chambers for ideas take the example that was going round on video a while ago of the group who wanted to exclude western imperialist science because its racist to say that people cant summon lightning by performing a ritual where a safe space is used to allow people to hold an activist idea without putting it before the marketplace of ideas then it is harmful both to the people in the safe space and the people those people interact with by the way the gym thing in the original comment comes much closer to the former than the latter the only reason i can see having a problem with it is if you consider it unnecessary without knowing the specifics of behaviour in gyms i couldnt comment then youre losing out on a right for what appears to be no benefit to anyone consider how youd feel about redheads only time in a service you use because some gingers complained about being mocked anyway have a nice day
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah like redditors
ShitRedditSays,removed,are people arguing that things like jim crow laws and segregation would have worked better if instead of whites only signs things said black only and that people would support segregation if it was advertised as not keeping blacks away from whites but as a safe space where blacks would not have to deal with the racism of the evil white man
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a pakistani and ive never felt unwelcome at rthedonald i know the narrative is that it is a racist subreddit however ive had a completely different experience from what most people here and on other parts of reddit are saying perhaps i havent explored rthedonald enough like others have im not sure i visited the subreddit a lot during the election because it had a lot of news and information not found on other subreddits or even the mainstream media i think a lot of the claims against it are exaggerated and have made me a lifelong liberal who voted for trudeau more compassionate to their side
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt that how it works then
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is that not a racist statement how are they evil
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is a valid argument for biological sexes
ShitRedditSays,removed,i totally agree but just as an aside men please dont pee all over place thats gross if you cant hold it put on protective underwear i dont want to be going around stepping in your gross ass puddles god
ShitRedditSays,removed,did it ever stop being generally acceptable
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a meme
ShitRedditSays,removed,and youd rather she did what instead the president of a foreign country was calling for changes to the constitution which courts found he could not do then when the legislature started siding with the courts the president turned on the legislature then the military got involved we didnt start that chain of events and we arent in a position to have stopped them once they started the us is not omniscient or omnipotent and sometimes the right choice is simply the least bad choice what should hillary have done differently and why does one action or lack of action invalidate all the other good shes done
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt about penises vaginas this is about rm keeping pace with the plot and all the greatness it has had in
ShitRedditSays,removed,reminds you that its the current year
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahahahahahahaahahah
ShitRedditSays,removed,what are you gonna do about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,damn america is totally fascist now that our president was fair and squarely democratically elected hes gonna uphold laws and shit this country is going to hell
ShitRedditSays,removed,so germany for the germans
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt illegal unless theyre directly contacting the person in question deplorable but legal
ShitRedditSays,removed,you must not have seen the picture of trump holding that rainbow flag
ShitRedditSays,removed,nice echo chamber going on in here
ShitRedditSays,removed,rhillaryclinton where the salt mine doubles as an echo chamber
ShitRedditSays,removed,as someone who never visits this sub ever but watches a lot of standup can someone please explain whats wrong with this that bit fucking killed comics job accomplished louie doesnt hate black people obviously patrice doesnt either patrice is black on a side note rip patrice they have a comedy benefit for him every year in nyc to continue to support his family he was such a great guy
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you like small government you are racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is your problem pal you think that you need to teach a black person about his own culture we dont fucking need your help we dont care about your white guilt stop perpetuating the victim mentality that is plaguing my community
ShitRedditSays,removed,tell me whats wrong with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,gulags when
ShitRedditSays,removed,century schizoid queef
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpsimgurcomgallerypxzls
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpsimgurcomgallerypxzls
ShitRedditSays,removed,we should use quad double quotes to emphasize when someone is racist without spelling it out explicitly especially for people with power example trump was got elected with his vp mike pence i just read a news article about peter thiel
ShitRedditSays,removed,interesting my submission regarding the circlejerking and deflection on rhillaryclinton was banned
ShitRedditSays,removed,exactly some white people make it some dont some latino a people make it some dont some asian people make it some dont the list goes on skin color has nothing to do with success or failure
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes but they have darker skin and some of them even pray to ostensively the same god in the wrong way
ShitRedditSays,removed,no they dont mean the same thing undocumented implies they slipped through the cracks in the system illegal implies they bypassed the system entirely which they did the system is in place for a reason if you truly believe illegal immigrants deserve to be in this country then lobby to change the system stop illegally choosing to not enforce certain laws just because you dont agree with them and you know anyone with the power to prosecute you is on your side
ShitRedditSays,removed,no those are called trump supporters
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats funny because thats how we treat all other criminals why should these criminals be treated better theyre breaking the law why do they get special treatment when they break the law but its not the same for other crimes downvote me and ban me all you want because im sure thats whats coming but you know its true and thats exactly why ill get banned or downvoted
ShitRedditSays,removed,i havent been banned from this shit hole yet and since you are one of my favorite leg beards on this sub im going to bite on this comment and receive my ban no one appointed you the thought police full stop the majority of people that voted for trump did it for reasons other than white supremacy they have legitimate issues that they face on a daily basis that were largely ignored by the previous administration they are going to say and vote and think however the fuck they want regardless of what happens in this small insignificant echo chamber i know i know its really fucking hard not being a melodramatic overwrought fuckbag all the time eating propaganda for breakfast lunch and dinner i get it the temptation is there we all face it but consider that regardless of your circle jerking here trump is president for the next four years and if rural america has their needs met he will likely be president for the next now give me my fucking ban
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt mean to get you this upset
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realize theyre talking about b board right not autistic people
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought your name was frozen enema
ShitRedditSays,removed,please fuck off whitey nobody likes you
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i liked the joke it still is a sensitive subject
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill fix that
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi from rall this sub is toxic lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre the guy who said i am better than you because you like family guy and i dont there i said it and its the truth anyone who actually likes this garbage show is an absolute waste of carbon yeah im sure youre a great guy happy holidays
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean you realize that a vast majority of the posters did not think that the video was okay right myself included the posts that actually made light of it were downvoted not upvoted which is a huge part of this particular subreddit btw you just cherrypicked people who seemed to think it was okay then decided the entire thread was fine with it more than anything you just seem to have a personal vendetta against anyone and everyone that could remotely like the show regardless of whether they found that particular clip acceptable
ShitRedditSays,removed,no a cuck like him will just egg others on to do the evil deeds while he sits back safely and at a distance pontificating on why evil must be done in the name of the greater good guys like him should have their asses kicked every time they speak out this shit the cognitive dissonance and projection is strong with this one and with the responders too exactly little bitch needs a thumping from a real man ie not this poster too bad so many people are pussies now and would instantly press charges if they were beaten up its too bad people dont like being the victims of crime thats why you use mask for that thumping
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are two genders male and female the rest are mental illnesses merry christmas
ShitRedditSays,removed,i saw that shit get upvoted on til of course the fucking neck beards on this site cum in their pants for women eating shit thus place is disgusting sometimes the problem isnt even so much about this getting upvoted yea she was dumb the problem is rather that this gets upvoted and not other relevant shocking awful stuff that happens to women every day how justified do these guys think they are when they see this shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,most construction workers dont cat call its laborers who stand around all day
ShitRedditSays,removed,exactly little bitch needs a thumping from a real man 😉 i bet youd like that thedonald
ShitRedditSays,removed,when sullenberger landed on the hudson the first words out of his mouth were women and children first same as it ever was
ShitRedditSays,removed,slightly ot but i wonder if peddit identifies with harambe so much because he was shot for endangering a child how dare they call me creepy for staring at kids on the playground im a victim just like harambe
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a completely legitimate concern google holds immense power over the world this sets a precedent which may be abused since googles algorithms are secret we dont know what they censor and what they dont sure this time they are ruling in line with what we want but what if they were to decide that global warming isnt true or something else like that even if we did notice theres no independent oversight and no avenue for recourse those are two things that all great powers must be accompanied by
ShitRedditSays,removed,when i hate people who are unjustly misogynistic towards celebrities i personally hate because they are misogynistic and a whole list of other things the enemy of my enemy still turns out to be my enemy¯ツ¯
ShitRedditSays,removed,rape humor racism transmisogyny shes a rich and white being sexist towards her is wrong obviously but shes still shitty and not exactly lacking in privilege very defensive when called on that shit too similar to other white feminist celebrities like tina fey
ShitRedditSays,removed,well they probably know how racist she is
ShitRedditSays,removed,what browser tool do you use that gives you the racial make up of comment sections on reddit ive been looking for one
ShitRedditSays,removed,i actually think this is a dig at the lions
ShitRedditSays,removed,jawohl frau fuhrer feminazi salute
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,well you are saying we shouldnt judge durete for promoting and legalizing the extrajudicial murder of the mentally ill saying we cant judge a terrible person for the terrible things they do is a form of defending them even if you dont agree with them entirely i agree that we shouldnt judge the filipino people for electing him i agree its crummy when redditors do that but i dont agree that we cant judge foreign leaders
ShitRedditSays,removed,so earlier on you said watching a bunch of suburban white year old american dudebros discuss and pretend to be experts at filipino politics is something else its so easy to sit on the outside and judge from a throne of privilege im not telling you you said things you didnt these are actually your own words youre not a very honest person are you
ShitRedditSays,removed,fascist gets elected fascists head is acquainted with curb
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only good fascist is a dead fascist
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes because judging the many by the actions of a few is totally fair
ShitRedditSays,removed,you act like there havent always been assholes doing shit like this and in the same waysforms the only reason you see it now is because these shitstains decided to act out when people are actually looking for shit like this in order to point fingers and label others which is exactly what you are doing right now
ShitRedditSays,removed,hostile much look making the assumption that this will keep increasing is a complete logical fallacy since you haze exactly zero evidence to support it unless you are somehow from the future or something else equally ridiculous let me be clear here i didnt support the man in any sense but making assumptions and pointing fingers will only worsen any problem it only serves to bolster people like this since they see your hostility and react in kind i get that youre upset but is this really the best way you can communicate that
ShitRedditSays,removed,ever read the book i am legend
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys talk about white people the way antisemites talk about the joos its pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt cool at all yes trump is absolute fucking scum but this is straight up victim blaming
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree that it certainly doesnt help but have you stopped to consider that the people who did this have probably always been shitty i highly doubt that they got that way overnight
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol kys maga
ShitRedditSays,removed,the importance of understanting the reason people do the things they do is important imagine people rioting and causing disturbs if we only see the end results we see criminals who should be stopped but if we see the reasons we could see people who are tired of being oppressed and are pissed off because of it so if we only see the outside of course all the people who voted for trump are sexist racist etc but when we see deep things might be different and so we avoid being hateful because again being hateful only makes the other side more hateful too which in turn makes you hate them even more and so on
ShitRedditSays,removed,im from chicago ashamed to say this but its true ive seen almost white people get mobbed in the last hours theres actually groups here running around and hunting lone white people its fucked up but true
ShitRedditSays,removed,dubbed job of keeping it real in the hood dog i dont fuck w that unbelievable heyday in general
ShitRedditSays,removed,bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,removed,cool glad you got it ill now stop right here and let you alone to self reflect
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes some do but you have to remember that these are simple farmers people of the land the common clay of the midwest you know morons
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know a gay man who voted trump after his many pro trump tweets i linked him an article about mike pence trumps vp im pretty sure that was the moment he realized there is a very serious chance he will lose his rights his only tweet since then has been the word sorry so many people whom voted for him dont actually understand what they just did and im sure they will regret it quickly
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill just leave this here
ShitRedditSays,removed,this dude deserved it
ShitRedditSays,removed,so basically clinton until very recently
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have to agree about the polarity as an independent i can afford to be objective and over the last couple of days i have found it impossible to reason with my blue team friends
ShitRedditSays,removed,black people who have a much lower rate of violent crime uhhh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt vote for trump i didnt want him to become president im just antihate anyway have a nice day
ShitRedditSays,removed,like clockwork i got a pm from that idiot sjw suck except that they didnt advocate eugenics eugenics refers to promoting greater rates of reproduction for people with good genetic characteristics and lower rates or even no reproduction at all for people with negative genetic characteristics for the purpose of improving the genetic quality of the human population thats literally what he advocated you fool god these people are stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,we dont use triggered to mock people yo
ShitRedditSays,removed,you shit heads call anyone that hates muslims racist lol we win you lose
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why no one likes liberals anymore we have people like you speaking too much
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay as gross as the pedophilia is im more offended by their lack of creativity i mean if you get one person from any point in time go for a legendary sex worker or something jesus saddlebacking christ
ShitRedditSays,removed,im counting on the heroin epidemic and the suicides to thin the herd of these trogs a bit at this point awful but those problems arent getting solved for a few years at least at this point
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay that one was a little much we didnt all vote for trump can you narrow it down to christian ones or something jeez
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am white i dont like avocados i like pretty much everything else in texmex as far as base ingredients and need to branch out into more fullup latinx food sometime
ShitRedditSays,removed,not for opposing him moron because shes a criminal
ShitRedditSays,removed,rapeimpregnate the women kill the men isnt that what happened in the first place eurospanish dudes rolled in killed up a bunch of the native dudes then started rapin all the ladies oh shit they want history to rhyme
ShitRedditSays,removed,dude stop trying to ban fat mexican chicks theyre fine as fuck that shouldnt be a crime
ShitRedditSays,removed,he won the election
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah probably why hes hiring as his tech advisor in dc gays must give him the heeby jeebies
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you read entire op he liked first she liked second then she chose not to send any message and wants people to laugh at his message i agree with that dudes response i receive one word opening messages and they are filtered out and not responded to i would not respond to such a lazy message either doesnt mean it wasnt a dumb post
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not sure winning the us presidential election counts as failing at every level of life though
ShitRedditSays,removed,trumpeteers love it
ShitRedditSays,removed,why did you ruin america was bored wanted to see what happened if we elected hitler
ShitRedditSays,removed,if thats the price to pay for other things yes i could accept that i dont believe it will happen though
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah clinton only lost because shes a woman and americans are sexist
ShitRedditSays,removed,clinton is a homophobic piece of garbage fuck trump he has no regard whatsoever for the wellbeing of gay people do not defend clinton a champion of gay oppression for decades
ShitRedditSays,removed,its funny to see a sub dedicated to ridiculing and shutting down real discussion ridicule a post claiming that real discussion is being shut down self awareness is going to be like the crash after a years long meth binge for you guys sure you can do another bump today to stave it off but your connect is going to dry up real soon and the rest of us are going to continue pointing and laughing as we have been since tuesday night
ShitRedditSays,removed,so the answer to the original question is there arent any
ShitRedditSays,removed,no the problem is calling everyone who voted for trump a bigot there was a lot more to this election than emails and pussy grabbing
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah okay buddy these rtheadolf users have the mental capacity of children but i have a hard time believing they cant remember a simple acronym much more likely this gentlesire thought he was being original™ and hilarious™
ShitRedditSays,removed,so im curious as to exactly what the current scientific consensus is even in this thread im seeing some disparity you cant say that in srs youll be labeled a bigot for even questioning them
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbf we need to make sure male victims have their voices heard on issues like dv and rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,freedom is best achieved with hellfire missiles launched from drones
ShitRedditSays,removed,the funny thing is cisgender kind of already means normal gender the prefix cis in latin means on this side of and trans means on the other side of across from
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs is the real bridge
ShitRedditSays,removed,cool so what exactly is this sub a sjw themed rroastme enlighten me please
ShitRedditSays,removed,no the equal of the sexes means feminism loses checkmate cuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,the real issue is that someone somewhere could complain about any of these succulent butts
ShitRedditSays,removed,he is pretty well spoken for a black person
ShitRedditSays,removed,i figured you needed a nice comment because youre such a miserable human being
ShitRedditSays,removed,despite all the modern definitions of trans and dysphoria and sources including the dsm and medical publications aplenty reddit maintains its aggressive ignorance isnt that all very new as in having gender identity issues were still considered a disorder until like four or five years ago if it took the professionals that long to say well i guess being transgender isnt a disorder in and of itself you gotta give the layperson some time to catch up cant have a trans thread without comparison to schizophrenia is there something wrong with schizophrenics
ShitRedditSays,removed,what has this got to do with the op he never said employment discrimination is not as bad as name calling also is white people not giving stuff to blacks racist cant they create jobs for themselves the richest black population in the world resides in the usa whites have provided better conditions for them than there own people could do
ShitRedditSays,removed,college education allows you to change the definition of words
ShitRedditSays,removed,you have to obey the rules of the institutions you go to
ShitRedditSays,removed,someones triggered hopefully i am getting ur heart rate up pretty high might help you loose weight
ShitRedditSays,removed,and i should rightfully be banned just like the muslims who refuse to follow the rules
ShitRedditSays,removed,im honoured lads first time ive made it to srs the downvote brigading while against reddits rules doesnt bug me too much its always a pleasure to provide you with a sense of justice keep fighting the good fight and never succumb to the horrors individuality or reasoned thought
ShitRedditSays,removed,its the fucking truth you judgmental dickhole you people are so fucking jaded
ShitRedditSays,removed,ahhh dont shout at me it hurts my ears
ShitRedditSays,removed,well at the very least you really should give that whole suicide thing a shot best thing you could do for the planet
ShitRedditSays,removed,then kill yourself faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,you already were you sackless piece of shit kill yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not the self hating sad sack i have no reason to you you are one sad and pathetic little faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,still here hours later mods are slow cmon mods people are triggered here
ShitRedditSays,removed,hate is a perfectly natural human emotion no need to run from it when you feel it embrace it then kill yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh no people asking questions and challengin other peoples opinions oh no the horror
ShitRedditSays,removed,of course not garbage like you never wants to contribute anything useful to society
ShitRedditSays,removed,id have guessed at least half of the posters in this thread are white well given reddit is about white
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a racist comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a racist comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,scientists
ShitRedditSays,removed,while continuing to deny that men ever do so why are you outright lying
ShitRedditSays,removed,nice reductio ad absurdum bro
ShitRedditSays,removed,most institutional sexism faded in the and were just dealing with the stragglers
ShitRedditSays,removed,not once but
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive never seen that
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow i thought srs was a meme you people are hateful vile fucks why not embody the change you want to be instead of becoming what you despise
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe because your a pussy and if your triggered by minor things you should grow up
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you guys actually look at the context or do you just see one line like this and get your pitchforks
ShitRedditSays,removed,protip its not trans people who are creating this bathroom drama its you cis fucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,and if you actually look at the context it refers to highway building anti cigarette campaigns etc not the holocaust or any war crimes no one was advocating that
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not the linked comment and its been downvoted
ShitRedditSays,removed,because most of the people that claim ptsd dont have it and are using triggering to avoid having to deal with whatever attention seeking bs they claim is a problem fuck those people as they are belittling and taking the piss out of people who legitimately have it oh and if you claim to have ptsd from reading comments on social media you are a cunt sincerly the rest of the world
ShitRedditSays,removed,i guess were all cuck libtards for caring about others being one has never felt so great
ShitRedditSays,removed,the fact that comics and games are so fucking stale should be more than enough reason for fans to rejoice about the industries branching out and exploring new narratives but fuck it why celebrate a broader more diverse rich and interesting media landscape when we can just bitch about it not just being all about us straight white men getting our egos stroked
ShitRedditSays,removed,the fact that comics and games are so fucking stale should be more than enough reason for fans to rejoice about the industries branching out and exploring new narratives but fuck it why celebrate a broader more diverse rich and interesting media landscape when we can just bitch about it not just being all about us straight white men getting our egos stroked
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think a lot of it is more frustration with people who self diagnose themselves with ptsd as an excuse for their behavior than a lack of empathy
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaahhaah we were talking about soccer you had to look for the example of speed skating to find any kind of facts relevant to your point
ShitRedditSays,removed,its like reddit finds the least intelligent person in the conversation on purpose or maybe theyre just giggling at the word retarded this demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the whole issue even the nonsensical arguments of transphobics who support the bathroom laws understand whats going on better than this they at least understand that trans people want to use a bathroom other than the one of the gender of their birth certificate this guy literally understands nothing about either side of the issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the gap will for sure get narrower and for some sports like shooting id say it should close as the talent pool as you said gets wider for women but we are a sexual dimorphic species and when one sees that the talent pool of high school boys in the us has better times at than the talent pool of all women runners in the world one sees that the physical differences between men and women are there if it wasnt obvious already
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is funny though
ShitRedditSays,removed,how were you able to type this after being diced to bits by this childs edge
ShitRedditSays,removed,they should try staying the fuck away from oxygen do the world a favor
ShitRedditSays,removed,op here what is so ridiculous about my stance you could have responded to it personally where you disagree but you took the cowards way out and posted it her for others to mock how brave
ShitRedditSays,removed,can you show me how much profit the womens soccer team brings in compared to the mens in general viewership for mens soccer is significantly greater than womens and the mens league makes much more money than the womens league the mens fifa world cup in reached billion viewers for the final compare that to the record breaking womens world cup that topped out at million the world cup mens made billion in revenue and turned a billion profit the latest womens world cup we have revenue figures on was in and it was a financial success by making a total revenue of million so simply by virtue of being in a league that makes significantly more money doesnt it stand to reason that the us mens team brings in more revenue than the us womens team even if the womens team is relatively better compared to the competition than the mens team i mean you dont expect wnba players to make as much money a nba players do you again i dont have figures for how much revenue the mens team brings in than the womens team does but i think the onus is on you to show that they bring in the same amount and have the same viewership
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank god they said it first hear that fellas these strong strapping lads wont mind pantsshittingly scary lumberjack men going over to their basements and giving them a good pounding because hey consent is fer nerdz hyuck hyuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey having your limbs ripped off one by one and being beaten to death with them cant be so bad no i havent had this experience in my life why do you ask
ShitRedditSays,removed,are we complaining about them talking about porn or the biotruffs are we complaining about them talking about porn are we complaining about them talking here here is the one true answer
ShitRedditSays,removed,what other possible reason can there be the world does revolve around us after all
ShitRedditSays,removed,as people who does this ungrateful bitch thinks she is mother theresa
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey dont you dare start insulting the box of sugaros this man child clearly learned his worldviews from
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes not wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub points out a lot of bullshit redditors write but this seems to me like getting too easily offended by a joke i mean the title is so misleading its about turkeys and not humans
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know the sarcasm is pretty obvious and satire of this issue is definitely valid
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you stay in this sub youll eventually get cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats racist sexist and cisphobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,especially this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you never heard a joke before its just a joke good lord
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this shitty theyre just laying out one possibility while not even passing judgement just telling his own experience it is possible and as he said its possible he did something horrible like ray rice think srs think with your brain
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah that sweet vengeance on other muslims sure showed those western imperialists at afghanistan today
ShitRedditSays,removed,them goddamn gooks are the ones who do it the most spicks are next in line what a shame that hitler didnt finish the job
ShitRedditSays,removed,hopefully donald trump becomes president so he can deport all these hitler enthusiasts
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound fat of the population finds you hideous the small percentage of men who dont find you hideous have fetishized your fatness because youre attainable to them and thus a more realistic fantasy like youd do whatever they want you to do because youd have to than a vs model its so crazy how fat women convince themselves that even a tiny fraction of men find them physically attractive we dont and we never will lose weight
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean what he going do massacre the jews congress wouldnt allow it
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha yeah they think you guys are selfaware at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,well this is new
ShitRedditSays,removed,she was getting angry because a fat woman sat next to her did you even watch the video i thought you people were against fat shaming
ShitRedditSays,removed,trump
ShitRedditSays,removed,kind of like how everyone on tumblr thinks their gender studies class makes them an expert on everything
ShitRedditSays,removed,i always tell the boys youre going to have a turn ─ and im like yeah when hell freezes over in my head the teacher seems like an asshole though
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is this on srs op of that thread is a muslim trolling in exmuslim slurring them as baconlovers and accusing them of supporting terrorism so they can use it against islam in other comments she uses slurs such as httpwwwthefreedictionarycomkuffaar the linked thread would be a mean thing to say to muslims out of the blue but in that sub in response to that op i think its spoton
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you not tell them beforehand whats a chaser are they really that violent im not being sarcastic im sincerely ignorant and dont know any trans people only time i think ive interacted or seen them was on dating sites and usually they say it right there
ShitRedditSays,removed,context is important if she had been truly sexually harassed in front of all these people of all shapes and sizes dont you think a single person would stand up for her literally everyone in the vicinity is laughing at her and not a single person is defending her they all saw the entire event unfold you didnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont worry thats the job of rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,this still seems like it could have been handled better with a station rotation system like the one we use at the daycare i work at this way everyone has a chance at breaking out of any gender stereotypes they have been effected by giving girls opportunities for block and boys opportunities for dress up
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have no idea what point that op is trying to make im just genuinely confused about what its saying protip its a shitpost not a dissertation cut down on the words and at least try to be funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,why does it disgust you
ShitRedditSays,removed,well hes not wrong but i would expect you tumblr whiners to understand that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i can see where hes coming from
ShitRedditSays,removed,context guys walking into the ocean of them wearing socks of the guys in the picture wear socks to walk into the ocean
ShitRedditSays,removed,can someone explain whats wrong with this im sorry but isnt this equality i dont know whats wrong with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not agreeing that they are referencing this but south park doesnt directly reference things for example when issues concerning mexicans arise they usually use canadians in the show as a substitute if they were referencing some kind of race war they would use a gender war in the show as an equivalent in the episode cartman even says to kyle dont know if youve noticed but race wars are back and now if we get gender wars too also in the same scene just prior to that he says i know that a war is coming between us and the girls i knew it as soon as they sat out of the national anthem if you look to whats going on in our current situation its black people sitting out of the national anthem so it seems they are gonna use the gender divide in the show as a substitute as a race divide some might say we are experiencing now
ShitRedditSays,removed,misandry can be a problem hating people for their sex just isnt justifiable the problem is that they just only care about that and none of the other ones of the list
ShitRedditSays,removed,it doesnt mean discrimination neither does misogyny themselves the words mean the hatred of men and the hatred of women there is not institutionalised discrimination against men but there are individual people who hate and are prejudiced against men bigots exist in every group and there are people who hate specific groups of people bigotry itself is an issue and we shouldnt accept or allow it in any form
ShitRedditSays,removed,so bakers should be allowed to only bake for straight couples
ShitRedditSays,removed,eloquent response
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont you know that there were blacks who sold blacks into slavery that absolves the american slave trade and jim crow and deny black people the right to vote go to school own real property to be honest that is a real humdinger for the argument for present reparations for black slavery which makes it such a relief that black lives matter is mostly about present day police brutality and not just a mindless mob that is trying to push for slaughter of all white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,and this is the problem with feminism because of feminism you have to come up with bullshit reasons like this to fit your feminist narrative that patriarchy which doesnt even exist is to blame for all of mens problems the men dont want to stop to ask for directions tropeand all other variations is just a trope it doesnt exist in the real world men arent ashamed to ask for help at all men are people toogasp and people just want to solve their problems asking for help is a common way to quickly solve problems which men use all the time you like most feminists have a twisted view on men id argue most of those problems are caused by feminism itself especially how boys are falling in school compared to girls
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not like anyone said hey guys go down vote this post your sub is just whineyannoying and more people realize it than your little echo chamber wants to believe
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously you are so fucking ignorant and up your own arse its unreal
ShitRedditSays,removed,im irish and my people were also sold as slaves hundreds of years ago dae think i should get free stuff too reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats wrong with banning misandry uh i think the op statement is as stupid as anyone but do you seriously have a problem with a subreddit banning bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can discriminate against white a lot and asian a bit too sat scores are reduced if you are white or asian points are added if you are a minority besides asian
ShitRedditSays,removed,uh did you not have sex education when you were in school men of all ages can get intermittent random erections although it happens less frequently as they get older it should also be noted that random erections positively correlate with good cardiovascular health
ShitRedditSays,removed,the truth hurts
ShitRedditSays,removed,yup unless your kissing someone elses ass your screwed if your white and even open your mouth
ShitRedditSays,removed,you block them because you know if you dont theyll be able to respond to the bullshit you spout
ShitRedditSays,removed,embrace it everything they do is just another nail in the coffin for these types of people after the revolution theyll be among the first lined up against the wall
ShitRedditSays,removed,good snark is an art
ShitRedditSays,removed,first other people will already suffer from the regressive hateful legislation and action that will come from trumps legislation second im not sure i consider them fellow americans anymore i consider them a threat to everyone around them and for that i hope we eradicate them and their shit ideas
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is no such thing as multitasking there is only doing multiple things at once shittily
ShitRedditSays,removed,but can you knit one
ShitRedditSays,removed,the majority of the cent wage gap is a myth though the number is between percent depending on which economist you believe no serious economist claims its cents on the dollar
ShitRedditSays,removed,arguing that women make cents on the dollar primarily due to a lack of equal pay for equal work is pretty stupid i dont understand hate but its a pretty silly argument thats universally rejected by the data
ShitRedditSays,removed,you cant argue that employers are paying women less though because of seism if the reason women are making less is that they are going into lower paying fields and not working as much
ShitRedditSays,removed,because it cedes the intellectual high ground the left has you have idiots like trump claiming global warming is fake and vaccines cause autism the right can point to the wage gap and say see liberals believe in unscientific stupid shit too just stop citing the cent statistic and look at the actual data
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you control for nonsexist behavior by employers the gap becomes incredibly narrow thats a perfectly legitimate argument no one is denying there is a gap the question is what is causing it
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets be honest you could probably kill million or so whites without anyone really noticing any real genetic loss
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive heard it multiple times so wtf are youj talking about
ShitRedditSays,removed,women that think they get paid less for the same work should get paid less
ShitRedditSays,removed,whos making up things
ShitRedditSays,removed,hows that
ShitRedditSays,removed,how can you call someone rural redneck scum and the lambast people for hypothetically referring to people as filthy mexicans dirty muslims isnt that hypocritical
ShitRedditSays,removed,in the ditch we put you in with the rest of you race traitors
ShitRedditSays,removed,already enlisted
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah stop viewing them as transactions the husband should totally pay up that alimony
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi heres a summary of what a strawman is a httprationalwikiorgwikistrawman is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater httprationalwikiorgwikiredherring their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance while their argument would still be fallacious they can be at least
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree hitler had better social programs brb washing hands forever
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you have to be convinced that the kkk has legit complaints youre definitely part of the problem they dont see it but this really isnt any different than the with all the blacks who kept saying deyr jus evil whitey keepin da black man down same shit different year
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just want to say when a white guy shot up a kindergarten classroom no one blamed white people you did
ShitRedditSays,removed,alllivesmatter
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have confirmed my ancestors owned slaves and i dont give a shit lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit its not nice to use gay to mean bad yes it is nice i love it kill all redditors
ShitRedditSays,removed,the protestors have less of a right to create a dangerous situation than the driver has to carefully edge forward through them my favorite is even if a car is very slowly edging through the idiots decide its a great idea to gang rush the car all that does is cause the person to floor it stupid people hurting their own cause
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh cmon i get wanting to be seen but there are plenty of better places to protest protesting on the highway is too irresponsible and risky because of the possible emergencies people have
ShitRedditSays,removed,proven fake multiple times
ShitRedditSays,removed,shit reddit says users are autistic sjw faggots
ShitRedditSays,removed,glad you enjoyed it shitcunt
ShitRedditSays,removed,im all for blm but i think blocking interstates is a bad tactic simply because it can cause a crash that could kill people
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does one become a user
ShitRedditSays,removed,are there any particular examples of white terrorism which you believe have been unduly attributed to mental illness or simply deemed inexplicable my impression is that large attacks bombings shootings etc in the united states are usually categorized based on who was targeted school shootings are not usually considered acts of terrorism because they arent directed towards any one group the killer is attacking the community they belong to in general in contrast attacks that target particular groups such as the oklahoma city bombing are considered acts of domestic terrorism overall i think the criteria are pretty consistent although i could be misinformed i havent really thought much about the question before so i dont have any strongly held opinions
ShitRedditSays,removed,just waiting for someone to post the old canard that neckbeard is totes insulting to autistic
ShitRedditSays,removed,the burden of the brutalized is not to comfort the bystander nor is it to potentially hinder emergency services that may in theory cost lives
ShitRedditSays,removed,but what about a traffic jam where emergency services arent even able to get close enough for the protesters to realize it ive seen this happen half a dozen times in toronto over the years
ShitRedditSays,removed,maga
ShitRedditSays,removed,im pretty sure everybody in the country called that attack an act of terrorism or equivalent language seriously not only did a parade of politicians call his actions terrorismhate crimes but he was even indicted for hate crimes i dont care if breitbart or other similar publications ignored the story or claimed he was just a garden variety lunatic that level of consensus is almost unheard in democratic societies at least in cases of deep set racial enmity is that seriously the worst incident you can name
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok i did a google search for planned parenthood bombing here are the headlines antiabortion violence wikipeida a brief history of antiabortion violence cnn violence statistics history national abortion federation colorado planned parenthood shooting is part of a frightening trend huff po of the worst terror attacks by extreme christians and farright alternet a history of attacks on planned parenthood global news violent attacks are nothing new for planned parenthood cbs a brief history of deadly attacks on abortion providers nyt most violent attacks on planned parenthood medical daily the new ugly surge in violence and threats against abortion providers mother jones wheres the effort to try to attribute the attacks to lone lunatics am i using the wrong search engine or something literally every single link contradicts what you are saying
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you mean the aurora shootings which was an indiscriminate attack on a cinema or the shooting of aura rosser the first seems to clearly be the work of a nonpolitical lunatic and the second was an incident of police brutality
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think anybody has every asked me that quite so directly before if you must know i have only posted on rthedonald once that i can remember and that was to tell them that they were wrong about something i think mra is a joke and have never even visited their communities i got almost all of my comment karma on rpoliticaldiscussion though i am far less active their than i was a few months ago other than that shitredditsays is actually the sub i have the second most comment karma on i like to try to make well reasoned posts here although i dont always end up aligning with the circlejerk or circlequeef you call it here of the sub in short i am here because i think reddit is pretty shitty and i like to browse through this sub to see what the latest outrage is i only interject when i think i have something useful to say so i dont have many the white men dae be evil amiright posts still i dont think i am advancing any particular agenda here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am here because i happen to like reading this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,also whats trp is that some other altright extremist bs
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh they are police tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,mayonnaise asses upvotes
ShitRedditSays,removed,like philidelphia
ShitRedditSays,removed,you silence rape victims and its sickening any other opinions you hold are invalid
ShitRedditSays,removed,you silence rape victims on rrape get off your high horse youre no better than a rape apologist
ShitRedditSays,removed,not wrong if they were also as a teenager i was attracted to other teens although i did and still keep my mastubatory fantasies to myself
ShitRedditSays,removed,makes one sex joke lol look at these losers cant go one second without treating all women like slots
ShitRedditSays,removed,i once banged eartha kitt in an airplane bathroom ama
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a straight white male
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you need to think of the whites try rpawg i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,it does apply i started learning japanese the next day i arrived to japan
ShitRedditSays,removed,boom roasted
ShitRedditSays,removed,the reply this sounds like some cuck fantasy shit they arent wrong a lot of the white supremacists who go on about cucks tend to be projecting
ShitRedditSays,removed,exactly a silverback gorilla has an average penis length of around one inch til i am a silverback gorilla
ShitRedditSays,removed,congrats on being a racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a person who lives in a city with a big population of hispanic people i am worriedbut my hispanic coworkers dont seem scared at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fuck is wrong with this person
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets see poles pakistani people middle eastern looking people arabs im not english who else am i missing
ShitRedditSays,removed,to say brexit is indicative of fascism is a little bit ridiculous honestly
ShitRedditSays,removed,all these racists think you arent racist unless youre calling black people the nword to their faces and actively trying to kill them its insane
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah were all on our yachts brah you fucking sjw dipshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know were supposed to be a circlejerk here but theres been instances of animals demonstrating racist behaviour without having been exposed to abuse or reason for their aggression towards specific races it isnt conclusive but its there also theres conclusive evidence of animals having social dispositions based on gender of a person so it isnt without precedent its quite possible the there could be biological groundings towards racist behaviour just like there is evidence of biological groundings for many personality traits it would be different from individual to individual but there are likely genetic markers we do not yet understand i say this not in defence of it but because we should always strive to understand it better in order to improve the situation
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah folks black on black crime isnt a problem at all srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes but especially between the sexes when considering free testosterone levelshttpwwwhealthlinecomhealthlowtestosteronetestosteronelevelsbyage cis male athletes will have a much higher levels of free testosterone even when pitted up against a trans male that supplements testosterone intravenously if the trt regimen is at prescribed levels trans males supplementing at safe levels simply cant compete with t levels in a cis male athlete
ShitRedditSays,removed,cis male athletes have considerably more testosterone than average cis males i can find a lot more articles that say the same thing if youd like its not really up for debate its a physiological truth
ShitRedditSays,removed,dae
ShitRedditSays,removed,are they wrong women are tiny babymakers who should sit around men should go out and do the work men are superior in every way id kill myself if i was a women its a sad life of machinegunning out fetuses like a tshirt cannon im not sexist just stating facts d rocketship away
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh nothing wrong with the unclean being wiped out its a necessary evil i even did it to my own brother he was a ugly sonuva looked like a goddamned catfish
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh it is kinda stupid after all the greatest country on earth america allows the kkk to exist and were are still great maybe europe should catch up to the times
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh women might as well make some toys for the kids while they pop em out like biscuit dough itll help the boys learn not to be women like them transgenders
ShitRedditSays,removed,those damn blacks are more savage theyre just less evolved they cant help it we just gotta deal with it and wipe their jeans out
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre just jealous
ShitRedditSays,removed,i do agree with what you are saying but it doesnt help the cause when a prominent clerics make comments about women dressing like pieces of meat which excuses the mens crimes old but ill never forget the absurdity of it
ShitRedditSays,removed,mate its not that big of a deal really what would you like to do with these people theyre not going to change their ways no matter how hard you criticize them im not saying you cant criticize them because obviously i dont like them but what will it accomplish
ShitRedditSays,removed,what was his race
ShitRedditSays,removed,the correct position to have is for identity to remain secret until conviction for all crimes not to do a weird carve out for rape specifically
ShitRedditSays,removed,link to the thread i need to see this self aware racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,kittens are better
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive never heard anyone say suck my penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,humans are a more intelligent species than chickens otherwise it wouldve been us that would be being served to our chicken lords and forced to fill complete their desires etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think theres a larger group of people that doesnt tolerate fat people because its different from race gender or sexuality what are your thoughts on this
ShitRedditSays,removed,no its just called racism sjws love to use the dictionary definition of feminism but not racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,if its such a small tiny itsybitsy minority of rape allegations are false how is it that i a normal person know of at least in my life and these were vetted by the police and many of them were found to be made over simple things like he was a jerk and i wanted to teach him a lesson
ShitRedditSays,removed,redditors empathise more readily with a rapist than with a rape survivor if an accusation is false then there is no rapist or survivor just a thought
ShitRedditSays,removed,this people accused of crimes need protection from labeling
ShitRedditSays,removed,do i even wow forget the woman who got raped here its the man who may or may not be the rapist whose livelihood is most at risk here so a man accused of this horrible thingand is innocent has his name destroyed forever while the real criminal is free to do what he wants protection of the accused that is all that is needed after hes found guilty thats a different story
ShitRedditSays,removed,if they fapped to transgender porn they wouldnt be straight just saying
ShitRedditSays,removed,a gay guy wouldnt be attracted to transwomen
ShitRedditSays,removed,this subreddit seems like secondlife
ShitRedditSays,removed,powerty
ShitRedditSays,removed,you cant identifying you as jewish does all it needs to no additional power is necessary
ShitRedditSays,removed,read the news because youve been under a rock it may fucking amaze you to know that not everybody lives in america
ShitRedditSays,removed,because guys get hit alot
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is a study linked comments down showing that females who abused male partners face virtually no consequences in fact when males called in a domestic violence report they were more likely to get arrested then there female partners
ShitRedditSays,removed,wiggling out of all the consequences of what is best case a mistake you have a big part in making doesnt sound very manly to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,but your right for bodily autonomy shouldnt mean that someone else has to keep paying money for the next years if you feel you cannot afford raising a child on your own then maybe you should reconsider abortion
ShitRedditSays,removed,you usually see people getting called neckbeards and ugly virgins in srs comments innit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have an idea wear a fucking condom
ShitRedditSays,removed,how was community college
ShitRedditSays,removed,i used to spend time on when i was a stupid edgy teenager even on pol the ammount of people admitting to msturbate to anime girls and boy traps fembois and transgender porn is surprising
ShitRedditSays,removed,but what about the situation thats named in thread like if a woman poked holes in a condom or what if the man was raped it shouldnt have to be his responsibility in those cases
ShitRedditSays,removed,a diffrence between teching nazi ideologi in school and letting people talk about it i dont care waht you guys say but indoctrination in school either left or right is wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats the concern troll comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,can someone explain the whole more than one gender issue to me i feel extremely ignorant on this subject yet ive no idea where to ask nor learn more about it i understand the concept of sexual identities and the transgender issue of society misunderstanding or being idiots towards them but all the time i see people saying there is only two genders or several posts a day on here usually along those lines on the subject matter what are they making fun of is there not two genders is there two genders but theyre just making some bullshit up just to be ignorant i dont get it
ShitRedditSays,removed,because sodais an addictive destructive substance on par with other drugs that shouldnt really be sold especially to children at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean welfare queens s
ShitRedditSays,removed,kinda like how black people cant be racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not homophobia homophobia is the fear of homosexuality all the guy said was that the gay accent is annoying and theres nothing wrong with him thinking that i personally dont understand it youre gay youre into guys why sound like a woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,this subreddit is cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,exactly we dont know nearly enough about this case to judge what action will be taken the year old could be manipulating the year old the teacher could still have sexually abused her or the year old could have lied about her age to the year old and manipulated the whole situation herself we simply dont know the facts and thankfully this poor girl wont be being tried in the court of reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,making assumptions about the year old is almost as bad as them making assumptions about the year old this very much could be the case but theres also a chance the year old lied about her age i used to at and manipulated the situation herself we simply dont know from the small bit of information contained in that post whatever the circumstances shes still a minor and the way they are talking about her in the linked post is disgraceful
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a real thing the poster is just using it wrong its typically used to refer to misguided attempts to prove that someones one of the good ciswhitesstraights like the safety pin campaign or when people say women and those who identify as women this is a response to a complaint and it has the tangible effect of reminding people that there are those who exist and dont fit into the ladies and gentlemen paradigm
ShitRedditSays,removed,all year olds are different by i thought i knew everything about sex and relationships i had a fake id went to bars told men i was and had relationships with them i honestly dont blame the men in those situations as there is no way they could have known my actual age i even had the id to prove i was older i wasnt going to school and was doing drugs i certainly wasnt behaving in a typical way for a year old its certainly not a time in my life that im proud of what im trying to say is we dont know this girls situation we dont know the details so we shouldnt judge any of the players involved without them from what other users have said its likely the whole story is fake anyway so all of this is merely speculation
ShitRedditSays,removed,im really not sure about this one regardless of how you feel about a year old dating and sleeping with a year old i think its at best questionable to not feel that lying to put an innocent person in jail for two months isnt shitty someone pointing that out doesnt seem like the kind of thing decent people point to and say how dare you the only way to get to that point seems to be if you think it acceptable for someone to lie to put an innocent person in jail
ShitRedditSays,removed,what are your thoughts on those who argue that race is a social construct too should they be able to freely choose who they are
ShitRedditSays,removed,u r one to talk lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,where was she raped
ShitRedditSays,removed,well no gender is also traditionally based on biological traits as well if were going to be openminded to alternative gender labels we also have to be accepting that someone might want to identify as african american even if theit pigment is white as snow
ShitRedditSays,removed,because the context was an answer to a question
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know ill get downvoted to hell here but you guys can give her some responsibility here yes the year old boyfriend needs punishment percent hes a piece of shit but shes not she is old enough to know what is right and wrong but i agree young enough that its possible the boyfriend convinced her to have sex with him however i also personally know many year olds who are oversexed legally she is a victim of statutory rape but it doesnt mean she was tricked the only victim we know for sure here is the teacher so how about everyone sticks up for him
ShitRedditSays,removed,and in this case the people who knew what they were taking about did sueing someone for filing false police reports and ruining your life is not victim blaming as in this case the girl is the one who did it disregarding all else as lawyers are supposed to do she committed a serious crime and should be punished appropriately nothing else is relevant legally speaking
ShitRedditSays,removed,im conflicted on this we were the home of the original pedocaust and i think we need to be careful if we want call out others who think they are fighting pedos just because they are wrong in this case doesnt mean the response to this wont have a chilling effect on pedo hunters
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not a real hoot if you just eat healthy
ShitRedditSays,removed,username is monkeymasher and his flair says roof korean
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you all for the upvotesdownvoteswhatevervotes
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes please do go to voat we dont need more crazies here
ShitRedditSays,removed,put your keys on and jingle them in front of a redditeur hours of giggles
ShitRedditSays,removed,i actually think a lot of crazy folk on reddit get themselves so worked up that they are under the impression a woman can accuse you of rape and you go to prison the volume of posts i read on here with guys seemingly terrified of womens rights is staggering and by that i mean if she shoves you then youre not allowed to punch her in the face this doesnt seem fair to certain groups on reddit i really think theres a secret fear theyll be arrested for rape and theyll have no way out cause all a woman needs to do is cry rape i read a lot of threads where this kind of shit comes out i know theres a lot of americans on reddit and i really dont know what kind of ship youre running over there guys but you got some messed up simple man in the street type posters
ShitRedditSays,removed,he has a point alot of very reasonable comments is getting downvoted because stupid feminists think their extremely left opinions are correct alot of right leaning realistic stuff is factually true especially about different cultures but feminists are so deep in the ideologies they dont want to see it d
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not targeting men its targeting boys at the same age or younger than these girls as its click bait the insane popularity of mine craft lets plays shows that kids are online clicking on everything regardless of how stupid why are all those click bait videos girls in bikinis because year old boys know if they go to a porn domain they might get caught but youtube is ok so they click away the older guys attracted to this stuff is probably in the minority as the rest of us would just go to a porn site as theres plenty with girls who look like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,he posts ironically on srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol no one in india gives a shit even in my parents home back in india the swastik symbol is displayed in a lot of places our car registration plate has a swastik symbol on it and so do the cars and motorcycles of a lot of our relatives
ShitRedditSays,removed,what would you say this meme is trying to communicate within the white nationalist movement
ShitRedditSays,removed,nothing could orbit around something so tiny
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit i think this is genuinely the worst ive ever seen on reddit how do some people have zero empathy i think a complete lack of empathy should be regarded as a mentall ilness and these people should be treated professionally ffs
ShitRedditSays,removed,the question is just how many of their animals are the equivalent of the legendary middle eastern goats being brought into focus to note those other people disrespect and hate women other religions and other races and have sex with goats instead of sheep therefore theyre hateful evil and actually very different from us
ShitRedditSays,removed,er dont fight transphobia with ableism please
ShitRedditSays,removed,a western woman converting to islam joining a radical patriarchal terrorist group of any faith or ideology is like a black guy joining the kkk for a bunch of pedants reddit sure loves to ignore vitally important differences in terminology
ShitRedditSays,removed,why should it even if that person does indeed kill themselves over an internet comment chances are they arent stable enough to benefit society aka who gives a fuck everybody kys
ShitRedditSays,removed,well you guys mascot is a dildo but dildos arent seen as communist neither are those silly goon emoticons you communicate in
ShitRedditSays,removed,no theyre saying that pepe was used by boards before being adopted by white nationalist groups
ShitRedditSays,removed,so if pol starts posting dragon porn does that mean you will abandon it as a nazi meme
ShitRedditSays,removed,the biggest brigaiding sub complaining about people brigaiding oh the hypocrisy
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do realize that women cant drive in saudi arabia right or go out on public without a man or legally be raped yes its illegal for a woman to go to saudi arabia and then get raped
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure hed love too but the srs thought police ban anyone that dares challenge their limited worldview or hurts their feelings
ShitRedditSays,removed,of course not only white people can do bad things and can be held accountable for their actions unless their last name is clinton or bush
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys pick some low hanging fruit grow up
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh i will add that the daycare center i used to work at had a policy that no male staff members were allowed to change diapers because supposedly some parents complained
ShitRedditSays,removed,equality can be achieved without unfairness like all good things it takes time
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks for the cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are straight up losers if you think this is offensive holy shit have a little fun in life stop letting everything upset you

ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck uspez
ShitRedditSays,removed,cant see beyond the boundaries of their sad little internet world you just described this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,while its an overused joke i dont see this offensive or wrong its just a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think my iq just plummeted into the negatives they arent seriously so far up their asses that they think other people talk and think the way they do right
ShitRedditSays,removed,can we just mass abort redditurds it would help the world
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just made that comment because i knew i would get karma if i added the upvote if you agree i see what you mean though about other people in the community
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean i made that comment just to make easy karma what i found more objectifying than what i had said were what the replies to that comment said
ShitRedditSays,removed,suck reddit dick thread chill out
ShitRedditSays,removed,kids
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love how you say this but everyone here hates srs but refuse to question yourselfs
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you pay attention to the pedophilic art on instagram and in the podestas homes
ShitRedditSays,removed,you really cant deny that there is a certain stigma around men and children in our society no not in all cases but theres enough stories of fathers hanging out at playground with their kids getting weird looks im not saying this is the fault of women or men or whatever in general but there is a double standard just like there are other double standards that are unfair against womenother groups why is that if a men says hey i feel unfairly treated on x because im a men is mostly received with lolno doesnt happen here lots of redditors are shitbags but thats not an argument to dismiss real worries and problems some men face i just really needed to say that no offense to you or anyone else here meant
ShitRedditSays,removed,how big is your dick dude and is does a power bottom
ShitRedditSays,removed,he went jogging and on his run he stopped and sat on a bench by a park to catch his breath and check his phone which is when it happened and he was only there for to minutes and i know he wasnt dressed creepy or acting weird hs said a few parents came over and were quite nasty towards him for no reason it upset him pretty badly and he ended up changing his jogging route
ShitRedditSays,removed,and whats wrong with that
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not saying it does happen every time im just pointing out it can happenespecially with lgbtq people just look at the whole trans bathroom bullshit what about the children men will try to go into womens restrooms to rape our daughter
ShitRedditSays,removed,equality cant be achieved without inequality
ShitRedditSays,removed,i reddit on the toilet often
ShitRedditSays,removed,like i work in corrections ive interacted with some hella fine convicted rapistschild molesters attractiveness doesnt prevent someone from being a rapistchomo it just makes it easier for them to get away with because attractive people tend to get the benefit of the doubt
ShitRedditSays,removed,it obviously doesnt happen every time thats just hyperbole but that doesnt mean it just happened once either i would say it happens enough to still be a problem just not to the same extent as it is often made out to be on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,its because they are off their rocker to begin with
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not a trump supporter but he would give speeches every day while he was campaigning sometimes in different states meanwhile hillary would give one every few weeks the dude at has more energy than most of the people on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,off their rocker i say
ShitRedditSays,removed,you insert pronoun here are so shit at baiting you and your pathetic sub need to try a little bit harder
ShitRedditSays,removed,personally believe hes right grew up in a very diverse environment im brown lived in hong kong with australians english chinese and cantonese people didnt know what racism was until i moved to canada where it was a real problem i feel like humans obviously arent racist and the racism that exists today is carries over from previous generations so maybe growing up in a society where the mere concept of racial division is blasphemous might prove to be more helpful
ShitRedditSays,removed,sources
ShitRedditSays,removed,tia
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is that even a joke shouldnt you only believe in something if you agree with what it stands for your logic is flawed sorry
ShitRedditSays,removed,quote from op was about birth control op equated the two that aside margaret sanger founder of pp had a stated purpose in supporting eugenics httpsenwikipediaorgwikimargaretsanger
ShitRedditSays,removed,this shouldnt be here he was simply providing a reason he believes it happens not justifying it he even admits later on in the thread that its a shitty thing to do and he sometimes calls his friends out on it even if you think his reasoning is wrong mocking people for simply providing a reason for this kind of thing is the wrong way to have a discussion about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont even worry bro im about that life im black and i wont tip if you suck when you give me the check i will take you aside and let you know precisely why you aint getting shit for a tip and then i will be about my business give good service and i will give a good tip
ShitRedditSays,removed,ppd is supposed to be about those women who go omg i cant do that im a girl or dont give me a ticket im a pretty girl which is annoying as fuck and those are the women that become the standard women in peoples mind which causes the women are weak and entitled and im not like other girls crap but now ppd is almost always just a random woman doing a random dumb thing she is a dumb woman though if she were a guy id say the same thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,curious wheres the racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,although im of the mind that fph was a dumpster fire made with the intent to hurt feelings and just be cruel self hatred and negative motivation was what made me start losing weight i realized that i didnt want to be depressed about being overweight anymore and trying to look in the mirror and tell myself im happy with what i see because harder to do everyday so i had my only friends harass me by calling me a fat piece of shit and whatever every day i failed to go to the gym i went from to currently and still working on myself im obviously not saying that it works for everyone its almost like people are dynamic and what works for some might not work for everyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope im not breaking the rules by replying but aside from the bad police do what theyre told argument were most people in srsd really defending cops some were just pointing out that the alternatives are basically vigilantes andor lynch mobs
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you know hes white a look at his comment history doesnt reveal anything about his race
ShitRedditSays,removed,kink shaming on srs lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,serious question not trying to be sarcastic or anything i find your comment really interesting because i honestly have never heard that you can be obese and healthy of course many different body sizes and shapes can be equally healthy but can you point me toward some sources or articles youve found that say clinical obesity is healthy
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha look at all the feminists triggered by the song made as a satire wwait nobody is offended mmuh narrative
ShitRedditSays,removed,scientifically a big ol pupper
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not a racial jab because asians not enunciating words good has never been a racist fixture in comedyportrayal of asian peoples in art amirite
ShitRedditSays,removed,im seriously confused ive heard of srs and have followed you guys for awhile but isnt forced covering of the female body because it might make men want to rape exactly the kind of thing you would be against im stupidly confused as to why this was posted here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i completely hear where youre coming from at the same time i think we can use some bothand thinking and acknowledge that shame is a powerful motivator for all kinds of behavior change bullying of any type is really immoral especially any kind of concerted trolling or street harassment that said i dropped lbs myself in large part because of discovering fph and experiencing a strong wake up call i still have some progress to make for athletic purposes reaching my ideal boxing weight class but ive come a long way obviously for some people shame is going to drive them further into depression and wont do them any good but we can also recognize that for some including myself it can work there are lots of people who share that experience and it while its an uncomfortable truth its also a little nonsensical to dismiss it completely just because its uncomfortable
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpnewsroomuclaedureleasesdontusebodymassindextodeterminewhetherpeoplearehealthyuclaledstudysays so of overweight people are healthy compared to of normal people and of very obese people and this shows that bmi doesnt affect longevity how am i missing something
ShitRedditSays,removed,salty chink
ShitRedditSays,removed,by saying that you are saying you dislike how over of the worlds population treats women thats called bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are indeed toronto held a pride parade over the weekend featuring muslim lgbt this year and they invited blm to participate in the parade during the event blm positioned their float to block the rest of the parade saying they would move if a series of demands were accepted and signed by the president of the pride parade more focus on black and native american lgbt members more focus on trans no police floats or police security detail attached to the parade now people find the whole hostage crises a tad bit immature and hypocritical but we are mainly upset over that last point about cop exclusion not only has the toronto pd really stepped up its support of the lgbt community over the past decade but they also employ people from the lgbt community people dont want cops to stop doing something we largely see as good awesome even as its important for people to know they can trust the cops rather than fear them of a cop in the ish pride httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvhvndipbvte of a police officer in this years parade from a gay toronto cop fearing not being able to attend the pride event so now you know the whole story as to why people are upset over blm on a side note there was also a lesser story a few months back of a blm activist claiming racism when her former employer university which are partially tax funded sued her for falsifying information to embezzle half a million in ot pay to give perspective on this one in order for her to have been eligible for that amount of money she would have had to have worked hour weeks from week to the week she quit thats about hours a day days a week for several continuous months
ShitRedditSays,removed,so shaming them for progress in a positive direction is good
ShitRedditSays,removed,gaming is a mental illness speedrunning is a particularly advanced form
ShitRedditSays,removed,people of colour
ShitRedditSays,removed,youve never used tinder have you right im sure she just wanted his help getting things down from the top shelf at the grocery store
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you wear flipflops in public you are consenting to me looking at your feet
ShitRedditSays,removed,not seen as inherently sexual every body part is inherently sexual we are sexual beings feet hands face butt breasts all fuckable
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats wrong with making a request people are too sensitive we arent puritans people have a right to ask and you have a right to say no btw can i see them soles
ShitRedditSays,removed,you hide it because youre overly sensitive there are plenty of people out there who like buttsthey write songs about it if there were songs out there called back them toes up and baby got soles people wouldnt find what i say creepy if id said i like seeing girls in bikini tops people would have agreed in spades and the comment would have gotten no attention get over that puritanical part of yourself man
ShitRedditSays,removed,what i do with the images in my brain is up to me its like photography i own the images i take in public
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok i usually ignore your little circle jerk forum here but you should be ashamed that you are feigning ignorance to get karma updoots on reddit use your brain and stop pretending to be stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,let me know when you find a way to punish thoughtcrimes orwell if you dont want to be fapped to buy yourself a nice burka and hijab and dont talk
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow i didnt give you consent to use sexual language at me i feel so dirty now and also kind of hot im kind of into it i guess im definitely going to go masturbate to this now thank you
ShitRedditSays,removed,well op of this thread specifically said forced so that is what i was going on for example in the fundamentalist countries like saudi arabia where women are forced to dress in a certain way in that case saying like the assumption that the woman is only dressed a certain way because the man that owns her said she has to is pretty misogynistic doesnt apply because the primary problem is that the patriarchy which are the very fundamental countries chose for the woman so she had no agency im also not crazy about the lackadaisical comparison with slavery theres a whole lot to dislike about this comment even if you are critical of the problematic elements of islam islam has some references to slavery so you are correct that comparing this to slavery is odd as that is a very different part of the quran no but my experience with reddit plus arguably the whole point of this queef right here makes me lean towards assuming this is a whole lot more about bashing muslims than it is about defending the rights of women two steps forward one step back
ShitRedditSays,removed,where does this idea even come from i can understand not realizing theres a difference but outright denying the difference because you feel like there isnt just doesnt make any sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,the guy in the pic was more than feet tall
ShitRedditSays,removed,because it wasnt a short guy being insecure and hostile lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,if thats not a hate crime to you you probably just dont believe in hate crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i have a question how much do you weigh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would isnt that the definition of cultural appropriation the dominant culture rejects something that a minority culture has built blames problems on that minority group because of that culture then they take that culture blandify it and call it better thats like literally what is happening here
ShitRedditSays,removed,no you had it right the first time without thes
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are fat girls so fucking insecure and hostile
ShitRedditSays,removed,literally nowhere in the comment you replied to is the phrase hate group mentioned or even alluded to
ShitRedditSays,removed,to a degree thats a true statement
ShitRedditSays,removed,i kind of have to disagree with that gender is a spectrum that doesnt exactly gel with this idea and just acknowledging that someones chromosomes dont match their gender doesnt devalue their identity sense when is genetics supposed to be real but identity isnt isnt the whole point that we shouldnt be judging each other based on either
ShitRedditSays,removed,ahaha sick joke ahah yeah thats the stuff girll oooh yeah cut those balls off just cut em off ahah jkjkjk just kill em ahah mmmmhmmm oooh yeah girl girl power
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not true though biological sex is a thing with the exception of intersexed people human biology is pretty rigid about us having binary sex organs i dont want to boil this down to a semantic argument but our sex does exist ignoring it is counterproductive we just have to embrace that it doesnt have to be a part of your identity the only context people should even be talking about biological sex is for medical reasons its incidental pretty much everywhere else your gender is the part of you you make your identity
ShitRedditSays,removed,you dont understand if you have xy chromosomes and are transgendered you are a woman but when you go to the doctor and get diagnosed with testicular cancer your sex is relevant to your doctor and you and no one else but still relevant im taking intersexed people out of the equation because its exceedingly rare and its not really relevant the medical stuff involving intersexuality is pretty complicated and not something i fully understand
ShitRedditSays,removed,rfatpeople hate inspired me to lose pounds and i have kept it off for over a year that is all
ShitRedditSays,removed,the black civil rights movement was the most admirable movement in human history as a result of that movement minorities are well represented in politics entertainment and professional sports and they have ample opportunities in education and business but these opportunities are seen as repugnant in most black communities if racism were still rampant i dont think a majority white population would be idolizing black athletes and entertainment figures i dont think neil degrasse tyson would be so adored and respected i agree there is still a problem with racism in america but it is not universal like the blm movement tries to portray it is isolated and rarely institutionalized did you hear institutionalized racism is illegal in the us denying someone a job because they speak poorly or dress like a gangster is not racism kids any white or asian person is just as likely to end up dead if they resist arrest while armed lets quit being delusional aye
ShitRedditSays,removed,you joke but there is a fairly large amount of post and website out there about how white south africans are being hunted by black south africans
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,ps im useless
ShitRedditSays,removed,which is irrelevant to the fact that islam is still terrible
ShitRedditSays,removed,privelages
ShitRedditSays,removed,how quaint the thought of a brown scientist having to exist for such an experiment
ShitRedditSays,removed,ghazi might have outlived its usefulness gamergate is long dead after all
ShitRedditSays,removed,two consenting adults having sex is disgusting this really says everything that needs to be said about srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would like you to tell me in plain english what you think the age of consent should be some sort of sliding arrangement describe it to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,stupid sexy children
ShitRedditSays,removed,they shouldnt be coming to our countries to begin with our countries are not charities they are not shelters for the poor they are organisms of strength and prosperity the more refugees you have the more the right is going to rise the more the right is going to rise the more anger and violence in your streets you cannot change hearts crime is drastically on the rise because of the refugees we should not sacrifice the cities that better men than you have built for misguided ideals
ShitRedditSays,removed,landmines would be amazing on the us mexican border illegal immigration is not a human right were going to end this madness
ShitRedditSays,removed,keith scott very may well have been pointing his gun straight at the officer we just dont know yet pig
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty sure when you commit hate crimes and loot it only helps reinforce your positive message
ShitRedditSays,removed,no because youre just into the same sex transsexuals believe in their minds that they are something they are not id love to be a dog but no matter how much i proclaim to society that i am a dog i am not a dog
ShitRedditSays,removed,what where did they compare poc to snakes
ShitRedditSays,removed,well hes probably right
ShitRedditSays,removed,the guy had a gun the police told him to drop it and he wouldnt they didnt shoot him just because hes black
ShitRedditSays,removed,i also used to not be racist and i used to be rooting for bernie until he got fucked by the dnc so i supported trump
ShitRedditSays,removed,le srs why no ben
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am a young man im a centrist by my own evaluation and every political test ive taken i like bernie for his authenticity he gave a shit same reason rand paul appealed to me i voted for trump because he appealed to some issues i liked why would i vote for hillary will all of the borderline illegal collusion between her campaign and the dnc and the mainstream media if the dnc wants to give bernie the middle finger i can do it right back
ShitRedditSays,removed,leah rowe leader of libreboot decided to leave gnu because of workplace could you call it that there isnt exactly a physical office or anything transphobia and everyones annoyed not to take away from your post but this sentence reeks of ignorance she did not leave gnu gnu is a software project owned by the httpswwwfsforg which of course have offices how do you run a company without an office httpslibrebootorggnuleahisnotanfsfemployee that is to say shes not the person in question that was fired what leah is doing is absolving libreboots connection with the gnu project does that mean theyll stop working on libreboot not necessarily it just wont have the brandingsponsorshipsupport etc of being a gnu project
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is the reason for this stupid subreddit whenever i see it the title is so negative hostile and destructive just awful
ShitRedditSays,removed,self preservation is not hatred
ShitRedditSays,removed,without whites there is no democracy in the world
ShitRedditSays,removed,that video single highhandedly has given so many people the excuse to be racist like you know youre fighting fire with fire right
ShitRedditSays,removed,wrong this requires the support of the mother as well why would a mother agree to throw away her meal ticket
ShitRedditSays,removed,having consensual unprotected sex is implicit consent to parenthood its called accepting the consequences of your actions
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair doesnt that usually require both parents permission anyway
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why ive learned as a man to pick a lane as it were if i want ladies to be willing to have fun cant be shaming them for doing so fairs fair
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would go where there is a lot of people and take everyones clothes off then when everyone was naked i would unfreeze time
ShitRedditSays,removed,you want to be oppressed so hard that you cling to every thread of evidence of your oppression no matter how farfetched or imaginary it is
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think if i could stop time id murder the entire human race just to make sure i get people like nevergetmarried
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,who in that thread was defending child pornographers they only said it wasnt as bad as child molestation which it isnt grand theft auto isnt as bad as murder but theyre both bad crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,dats racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys usually are
ShitRedditSays,removed,what pisses me off the most about all this deliberate hiring people because of their gender and race thing is that when america bombs in the future for it some asshole is gonna say see white men are superior when really you just dont fucking hire people just for their race and gender god damnit
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah they do i never said they didnt i said it wasnt bad as another worse crime you people are ridiculous
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree though only partially that among many other things is the whole purpose of experiencing a certain fantasy someone can have a feet fetish but it doesnt mean they go out and chop peoples feet off theres a good reason incest and loli hentai is so popular in japan although their government is constantly debating banning it all these things serve the purpose of release so i personally very much welcome any type of artistry work sketch painting written stories manga we that does present all kinds of fetishes precisely so that people can have a release based on their inner desires and not go out and bother people louis ck made a great joke about it in one of his stand up specials he mentioned that hed wish to establish a new kind of service for people beginning with his own death hed have his body be left alone in some room and people could pay to come in there for an hour and do whatever the heck is the thing they gotta do with his corpse like shitting in his mouth watching child porn however neah doesnt sit well with me after all this is a live human being youre looking at who has been raped against their own will and is likely traumatized forever will have a fucked up life in terms of establishing relationships not to mention themselves having a high chance to grow up with some fucked up fetishes if you really must bust a nut to child porn hentai was created specifically for you and its a handdrawn artist made piece of imagery that never hurt no one in real life
ShitRedditSays,removed,as an irishman id have to disagree with that
ShitRedditSays,removed,this comment is posted by the smoking hot girls son
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean jews
ShitRedditSays,removed,what do you think about meritocracy
ShitRedditSays,removed,because presumably he got hired because of his abilities and now others will be hired because of their gender and race
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah because diversity these days means nothing more than having a different shade of skin
ShitRedditSays,removed,pfft as if this creep has ever had a girlfriend
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you look at what y looks like now he kinda has a point tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,you got to have that success penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,alllivesmatter
ShitRedditSays,removed,one of the reasons i dislike columbus day is simply because i dont respect columbus that much for his accomplishment he was dumb his theories about the world being really small were wrong and he got lucky that he crashed into america before starving to death
ShitRedditSays,removed,white people are the majority of the population so its pretty expected that they will be pretty common everywhere you shouldnt feel unsafe or uncomfortable just because people of a different race are around you
ShitRedditSays,removed,its called affirmative action
ShitRedditSays,removed,blacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,blacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you are not a christian andor deny the trinity you still are not allowed to post in a christians only thread i dont understand how anyone can enjoy existing in that kind of selfcongratulatory echo chamber its the internet equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears and going nananana i cant hear you
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive heard people complain about gsm because of that to be fair though nonoffending pedophiles are oppressed including them would make pedophila seem like a legitimate sexual orientation though so i can understand the concern as for kinkstersidk im one and i wouldnt say were oppressed maybe stigmatized depending on what were into
ShitRedditSays,removed,sadly i fear that the internet is killing these emotions before the internet your circle of peers was made up of people in your day to day life we therefore got much more exposure to different people and ideals now people find an online community that fits their prejudices and dont even speak to their neighbors as wonderful as the internet can be i fear it will destroy our humanity
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean unless you nonkinksters are dead set on a working as a livein maid im not going to be taking jobs away from anyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does this interrupt the circlequeef tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people are vile
ShitRedditSays,removed,op has his facts straight wish i had figured this out before i was
ShitRedditSays,removed,for real doesnt he know theyre entitled to his money
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you have a source for this as all reports ive seen from the department of justice would seem to suggest this is not true
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a black guy this is so totally true i fear for my life every day whenever i walk down the street i worry about getting killed by one the millions of disgusting violent republican white people that inhabit this country
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you kidding
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol what he said was mean not mysogynistic do you always want peoples posts removed
ShitRedditSays,removed,the other day this white bitch was giving me crap just because i was buying alcohol with my ebt card and i drive a mercedes i guess i cant do these things just because im mexican white people are the worst when are decent people come to rise up and kill them
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont hate black people i hate black culture
ShitRedditSays,removed,duke case mattress girl rolling stone jackie who didnt go to court but everyone thought the frat was guilty in the court of public opinion
ShitRedditSays,removed,great rebuttal bravo
ShitRedditSays,removed,ooooh ad hominem such a good tactic
ShitRedditSays,removed,cant we all just burn all guns and white people and live peacefully ftfy
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol wow are you a real person so youre saying false rape allegations never happen idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,til wanting people who support genocide on a watch list is just engaging in political dissent and thats wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would be ok if they stopped testing for peds entirelyor created a separate untested olympics pretty much the entire nfl is on gear and its the most popular sport in america for a reason
ShitRedditSays,removed,any legitimate reasons as to why its dehumanizing theres no historical negative connotation associated with the word like there is for many derogatory terms i cant agree with people saying it makes them feel like an animal we are just like all the other animals i can only see the differential use of the word male female but its only something ive seen combined about on reddit and never seen people actually do
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats the one part i said i could see but have never seen people actually do that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i got an answer it didnt address the problem though why is it dehumanizing havent gotten a good one there
ShitRedditSays,removed,i fucking hate white women
ShitRedditSays,removed,so is what happened in
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a typical one like above but im sure id give the greeks any credence you can certainly use context to make it dehumanizing but you can do that with any word saying someone simply is a woman vs a female shouldnt illicit dehumanized feelings the greeks were unscientific and just made stuff up in their minds
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont even have a tinder you disgusting backwards trump supporting scumbag
ShitRedditSays,removed,i work i healthcare i see no distinction between saying a woman or a female when talking about a person the fact that some people apply their own derogatory association with the word where one really doesnt exist is mind boggling and some of the reasonings are just as so dehumanizing because it makes you feel like an animal give me a break the only reason ive seen so far is that people can use it in a sexist way and then some may carry that association to when ever it is used but it doesnt make the term itself derogatory whenever someone uses it
ShitRedditSays,removed,they couldve input wooooomen and you wouldve seen a difference
ShitRedditSays,removed,k
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was actually cool undercover thing we had going for a while but they ban to easy over there for it to gain traction
ShitRedditSays,removed,children lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,well it was posted on this sub so youre in fact offended by it
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are gonna be so butthurt when trump wins and fixes everything and you have to admit he was right all along

ShitRedditSays,removed,ayy
ShitRedditSays,removed,they assume every single white person is far better off than every single person of every single other denomination and skin color strawmanism
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet if his woman wanted to go to a male strip club he wouldnt be so understanding
ShitRedditSays,removed,every day i post an instance where rthedonald harassed or threatened violence against transgender individuals youre reading comprehension could use a bit of work im no fan of rthedonald but and are really the only ones that stand out as harassment or threatened violence i suppose as well but to me it comes off more as the usual dickishness that permeates that sub the rest are some pretty extreme reaches
ShitRedditSays,removed,it does make you a swerf
ShitRedditSays,removed,well yeah but getting a lap dance is at the very least polyamory adjacent is polyamory just swinging or does it include a marriage first necessity
ShitRedditSays,removed,im gonna go out on a limb and say we have no idea to know if the situation would be any different if the kid was white
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty hasty generalization there
ShitRedditSays,removed,black people where slaves for years some white dude was stuck in traffic due to blm youre right its crazy to think they are both equally victims it sounds like the white dude was actually inconvenienced not his long dead ancestors
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound awful
ShitRedditSays,removed,why d you hate white males

ShitRedditSays,removed,not all
ShitRedditSays,removed,how was his question vacuous
ShitRedditSays,removed,boohoo
ShitRedditSays,removed,being nice hitting on please explain
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is gibberish race is a concept invented by white people ever been to india or china deeply racist cultures no whites fucking grow up
ShitRedditSays,removed,the concept of race was created by the fact that there are different races you ignorant fucking lunatic
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand people that judge their partners based on their personality i prefer to date randoms off the street and love them regardless of whether i actually like them or not unless they are privileged shitlords shitlords should all literally die
ShitRedditSays,removed,japan is an absolutely filthy country for having an age of consent at any country besides america has absolutely no right to decide morality
ShitRedditSays,removed,just like in the ricci v destefano case absolutely disgusting how privileged people call racism when it should be the other way around
ShitRedditSays,removed,every man ever filthy pigs
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a weird irony with this post
ShitRedditSays,removed,well he did say one of
ShitRedditSays,removed,its an orwell quote you illiterate
ShitRedditSays,removed,i went to a gay club in houston tx called south beach one night last year with a guy i was dating and while there this really sweet deaf girl was talking to me well i brought the notepad on my phone out and we communicated like that while he was getting me a drink and she was saying how cute i am and asking for my phone number it was a really awkward situation like she was hitting on a guy at a gay night club why would someone do this look at this tryhard go because assuming there may be heteros at a gay club is something really weird but all the men out there who insist they can convert lesbians are not worth mentioning
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol this is nonsense anything starting with how ugly somebody else probably isnt going to delve anywhere worth going
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i actually dont disagree with this could help explain part of the regressive left
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh come on jokes can be made about any topic that can be funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,men literally hear this everyday from the time theyre years old its nothing shocking
ShitRedditSays,removed,uh what you realize the facts dont back that up right more domestic abuse cases are filed by men against women than the other way around
ShitRedditSays,removed,im here to chat what the fuck is up with this place every comment seems to be antimen this sub is odd
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats your solution then
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do people post nonsense like this the gap as defined is exceptionally misleading gross wages divided by hours worked is moronic and yields the oft cited incorrect statistic this ruins any discourse for examining the actual gap and its casual determinants example being that bls data show that women that dont get married have virtually no wage gap just north of unmarried young women actually outearn their male counterparts its not a black and white topic but it seems youre arguing that the cent raw number is somehow representative of reality which it demonstrably is not you say that no denier ever has a single source so im unsure how thats possible given that pretty much every single well done study pegs the adjusted gap to cents largest ive seen is or but this varies based on many things as well so im not sure what you qualify a denier to be goldin certainly discusses the gap but not the raw gap that is touted in the media and online she absolutely does not examine one single year in some random nonsensical profession with no context as for the consad report yes they discuss the reality of the gap but they do so after concluding that when factoring in those variables the gap narrows to between cents and cents on the dollar ill attach some random sources some are articles that i would go to their linkedcited studies rather than reading the article itself because well online writing is meh httpinequalitystanfordedumediapdfkeyissuesgenderresearchpdf httpfreakonomicscompodcastthetruestoryofthegenderpaygapanewfreakonomicsradiopodcast
ShitRedditSays,removed,what was the guy wearing anyway maybe he was showing off his body seemed like he was asking for it its probably wrong but i am half hoping that there will be a news about a guy who was raped just so i can use that line on selfrighteous pricks see how they feel
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly i see no issue with either rendition both comments are fine if you dont make any assumptions regarding narrative its the responses that bother me
ShitRedditSays,removed,yup i think the issue is people like to pretend the wage gap is only women get paid less for the same job so they dismiss it when people say well actually its a lot more than that men and women do get paid equally for the same jobs however women are encouraged to go after more acceptable jobs for women stuff like that you know pink and dolls are for girls teaching and part time work is for women
ShitRedditSays,removed,devils advocate sometimes you will get stuck with it or the mother will refuse i mean the fears are still insanely over blown its like saying a black guy will mug you sure criminals exist but for real the vast majority of people arent fucking psychopaths divorce can get ugly but i doubt anyone in that thread has been married much less had a real relationship beyond a week
ShitRedditSays,removed,privileged fing white male here i dont see anything wrong with what this man has said can some one please elaborate what he said was wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,what does that have to do with anything
ShitRedditSays,removed,personally i am shocked that theres an overlap of guys in mgtow and guys with small dicks shocked i tell ya
ShitRedditSays,removed,i seriously do not understand where do you see the issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,i masturbated into a banana peel then put the banana back in wrapped tape around it and fed it to a pheasant in reply to gsbadj on stop youre killing me at utc flgulf wrote i masturbated into a banana peel then put the banana back in wrapped tape around it and fed it to a pheasant
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are antifems so obsessed with manspreading like its a basic decency issure because of the endless clickbait published about the issue and other microagressions that promote this absurd patriarchy theory of course i believe these pop feminist media sites are mostly concerned about increasing ad revenue than actually promoting feminism the problem with modernpop feminism and identity politics in general is that it lacks a purpose once your identity group has achieved formal equality of opportunity which women have in the west its time to focus on things that affect all citizens increasing access to quality education healthcare job training so that they have a fair chance to compete against those born into better circumstances believing that women are limited by the patriarchy is to suggest women dont have agency even when women do things seen as antifeminist its because of their internalize misogyny rather then the independent decision of a freethinking empowered woman then theres the silencing tactics of many feminists banning shaming using ad hominems interrupting the gatherings of those they disagree with these illiberal authoritarian tactics are much like those used by the conservatives you claim to hate so yes theres a lot to disagree with modern pop feminism with manspreading a minor symptom of a larger problem and if i had to pick the most reasonable school of feminism itd probably be liberalequity feminism which doesnt treat women as perpetual victims now i await my ban from this subreddit have a nice day
ShitRedditSays,removed,virgins
ShitRedditSays,removed,innocent question why is this on shitredditsays i cannot find anything offensive or shitty about this summary of the events
ShitRedditSays,removed,its so horrifying that we have a candidate advocating sexual assault hes not advocating sexual assault in the past a number of women found themselves acting sexually submissive around a powerful billionaire and now a small number of them regret it so much they turn to the media to virtue signal over how pure they were in attempt to save face if america wasnt turning into such a safespace more people would be able to say that out loud without fearing persecution im voting for this man ban me from your crappy sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,women having children isnt a societal expectation its fucking biology not all women have to have kids but only women can have kids and all women have hormones that drive maternal instincts you cant address the problem if you dont acknowledge the facts around it
ShitRedditSays,removed,in fairness the shit that hillary did to bills rape victims is far worse than anything i have heard trump say asshole that he is its hard enough to step forward after a governor or president rapes you but then to have his wife ruining your life
ShitRedditSays,removed,fragcakes says if srs ran the country theyd tell the labourers to rise up against their capitalist masters and control the means of production making goods for use rather than for profit the first amendment would be in ruins because srss distain for free speech you may deny this but srss attitude speaks volumes to this fact noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo seriously free speech isnt the best thing ever it means that the state cant intervene because of the shit that you say and even now we dont have that free speech nor did we ever rightists think that free speech is more important that the right to privacy or the right to live thats why theyll throw a fit when people kick them out of their spaces or celebrate when somebody commits suicide because of verbal abuse if free speech means that hate speech should be allowed to flourish then it can and should be destroyed all you do by defending it uncritically is show that you see it like a religious icon the second amendment would be gone but you probably think its good thing to take away our right to defend ourselves dont yah maybe they do but get this the people whod have to defend theirselves would generally be doing so fromother gun owners oops i cant speak for an entire subreddit but i dont think that legally prohibiting anything is ever an effective measure if all guns were prohibited people would still find other ways to kill and even then there would be a few exceptions of people who obtained illegal firearms srs would probably agree that destroying toxic cultures and worthless social constructs would be far more effective at preventing violence in the long run employers would be burdened in proving that they pay women fair wages even though they done so in the beginning because the wage gap is a fucking myth heres a better idea tell employers to surrender their wealth and power and if they refuse terminate them then nobody would have to worry about wage gaps in the first place because there would be no wages business regulations piss off the owners because then they cant make as much money i say throw it all away nothing will be done against isis because islam is a protected group and it will be racist to anything to stop them even though they treat women far worse than we ever did and throw lgbts off of fucking roof tops any terror attacks will be censored and will be spun to fit your ass backwards logic i dont remember seeing anybody on srs defending isis most of isiss victims were and are muslims which you probably didnt learn from breitbart or conservapedia the fact that isis is destroying so many muslims doesnt usually get picked up by the mainstream media because it would damage the perception that most or all muslims are terrorists—or vice versa i mean if all terrorists are muslims as some rightists claim wouldnt that mean that any muslim is a potential terrorist nobody should get a free pass to oppress just because their discriminatory beliefs coincide with their religious ones oppression is wrong when judaists christians or anybody else does it and muslims arent an exception contrary to whatever tosh you may have been told oh you think sexism is a thing thats nothing compared to what will happen with a bunch or tumblr harpies start tipping everything to favor to women making the whole male gender second class citizens another hierarchy wouldnt help the only people whod desire this are maybe some female supremacists who are a tiny minority and intentionally dont identify as feminists precisely because its associated with equality need evidence young boys will have to take classes to tell them that they are nothing but sex crazed monsters must be told rape is bad you may think i am being hyperbolic here but i actually had to sit a fucking class like during my stint at a state university it was required thats funny because every time a lad sexually abuses or harasses a typical response would be they cant help it its their nature many of the people who say this are men but also some women whove surrendered to the status quo being sex crazed is definitely a staple of toxic masculinity everybody already knows that rape is wrong just like racism thats why they redefine rape to whatever is convenient donald trump for example sexually abused his wife but claimed that because they were married it wasnt rape people may know that rape is wrong but the dont seem to understand what rape is mens lives are destroyed because looking in a womans general direction can be called sexual assault stop making shit up men will be skipped over for promotions and raises because to satisfy insane diversity and equality regulations like i said no businesses are preferable and even if most or all of srs supports them they wouldnt tell you with a straight face that disadvantaging cismen would be a major improvement unless you think that theyre lying in that case i know a nice sub for you rconspiracy you are so lost in your delusions you lost all touch with reality you dont know even the slightest thing about the world outside of your little bubble you think know everything like some stupid suburban millennial shit who just spent his first year of indoctrination at whatever state or ivy league university wait is he implying that the state desires to create a dystopian matriarchy theyre doing an awful job if thats the case i have yet to attend any universities i have nonetheless been forced into a state school and later some quasi‐religious homeschooling and i dont think that any of them had significant effects on my political or anti‐political views i remember learning that communism was state control and maybe that anarchy was chaos but i looked at the perspectives of a wide variety of leftists including state socialists and eventually i transferred to anarchism schools didnt drive me that way my persistent curiosity did enlightened this shit isnt the renaissance a movement that takes actually pride in acting like sniveling children is far from enlightened this has done nothing to move us forward its funny how rightists like to ridicule progressives by calling them powerless children who cant affect reality then i see rightists ranting about teh sjws control everything like the media or websites so are they useless kids or do they have a huge influence on the media you cant have it both ways shkotzim the fact is youre not special stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself you dont know nearly as much as you think you do maybe i cant speak for uakulatheshark especially since he doesnt seem to be anarchist but it seems like hes at least on the right track however much progress he may need to make im not omniscient but at least i dont constantly reassure people that im telling the truth and to never question whatever they learn rightists or at least far‐rightists constantly assure people that theyre telling the truth they make things like feminism vs facts or liberal mugged by reality or the real sexism nobody should have to do this if theyre confident in their correction you should examine the conclusions and how they was obtained gringon of rosbifistan doesnt do that he glances at the conclusions and uses them to support his prescriptive view of reality he doesnt look at the backgrounds of them if you think you are the smartest person in the room spoiler alert youre not saying this person is smart is almost as meaningful as saying this painting is pretty except that paintings dont have lives theres no scientific consensus on what does or doesnt make somebody intelligent your opinions arent facts nobody cares reality is never simple trying to boil everything down two a couple of talking points just means youre a fool buying into snake oil maybe he did that but i dont know since his post was removed you are correct on the first point so ill give you that humility is good being a dismissive arrogant jackass is not what do you think that youre doing right now go back to your safe space kid no one wants what youre selling i love the irony of a rightist telling somebody to return to his safe space so that he doesnt have to view any leftist opinions just admit it gringos you have a safe space a space safe from anybody whod like to see you question how you view the world or yourselves i really dont understand the rights hatred for safe spaces since most communities have one and theres nothing wrong with that it seems like you enjoy violating the privacy of others and pestering them but hopefully im incorrect about that summary literally everything that this babykiller said is true in every way everybody get your sterilizers weve been compromised initiate operation straight white cismale genocide note im not even going to bother addressing this to him directly i just wanted to refute this people have better thing to do with their time than argue with brick walls
ShitRedditSays,removed,no but mocking me for not understanding it is funny right
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is factually wrong a white person do not have the same rights as a native in a country such as ksa or qatar they have worse rights solely because they are whites
ShitRedditSays,removed,god theyre stupid fat irrational cunts
ShitRedditSays,removed,girl posts cool videogame cosplay here are her boobs xray in reply to on i really dig how the artist did the cell shaded effectwho am i kidding boobs at utc wrote nsfw here are her boobs xray httpiimgurcomdfahamujpg
ShitRedditSays,removed,please explain whats wrong with posting that picture its not misogynistic or anything people just like boobs lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh i see why now lol i guess you do have a point haha
ShitRedditSays,removed,yah its not the best thing to do tbh but shes kinda dressed like that anyway i guess if i sent it to her you think shed have such a problem with it also and i know that this is controversial to say here but when that nude depiction of donald trump was floating around the internet everybody laughed and he doesnt even dress in such an exposed way so why cant we just laugh about this case here since shes basically nearly there anyways
ShitRedditSays,removed,its nigri who cares
ShitRedditSays,removed,well first id probably not let my daughter dress like that chick in the first place that would prevent pervs from sexualizing her even further
ShitRedditSays,removed,so nude depictions for sake of mockery good nude depictions for sake of fapping bad did i get that right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i believe this is a case of something making a dark joke making light of paedophillia not an admittment of actually being one
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a reason for that though there is an advantage of being born male over being born female same reason why theres and nba and a wnba
ShitRedditSays,removed,never said it didnt just that not paying attention to what youre even arguing against is not the smartest move
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt say it wasnt but not paying attention to what youre even advocating against is not the healthiest of decisions
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a bit of an immature response
ShitRedditSays,removed,you already replied to me on my reply to you earlier
ShitRedditSays,removed,pictured see before his parents pick him up from daycare
ShitRedditSays,removed,if israel did this it would be splattered over every tv screen on earth but thats because israel is a first world developed country and palestine is a third world pseudo nation held together only by a mutual love for killing jews at utc fuckfascists replied to if israel did this it would be splattered over every tv screen on earth but thats because israel is a first world developed country and palestine is a third world pseudo nation held together only by a mutual love for killing jews
ShitRedditSays,removed,every tv screen on earth might be a slight exaggeration but whats with this thread the person isnt actually wrong about any of what they said
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love it how everybody in this comment section thinks how much better they are in comparison to this scum who said a bad word you are bunch of narcissistic assholes patting each other on the back how progressive you are retard is a good insult i hope people will keep using it
ShitRedditSays,removed,disenfranchising ethnic groups and keeping them in apartheid breeds a lot of resentment much of which is justified this doesnt excuse a repugnant murder of a child but then again of palestinians would never dream of doing such a thing we shouldnt define a people by the worst among them can you imagine us being defined by redditors
ShitRedditSays,removed,capitalism ho
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey look an autist overanalzing reddit memes
ShitRedditSays,removed,this ignores context the post before his recommends dating younger than yourself t avoid problematic traits hes just exaggerating for comedic effect
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not at all surprised about ageism anymore especially after brexit when half the internet decided that uppity teenagers somehow magically knew more than older people days of nothing but fuck old people smh cant they just die smh fucking racist fucks smh they shouldnt be allowed to vote fuck old people omg cant i eat swiss cheese anymore wtf i am a teenage uppity college kid why dont old people agree i automatically know everything better than they do fuck democracy fuck old fucks smh
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats what we used to say about gays too as far as im concerned i have no problems with people attracted to kids who cares but if you take it into the real world and actually act out your fantasies on a child then holy shit you deserve punishment these fucking pieces of shit are basically crying and throwing a tantrum because they dont like the way a bunch of child rapists were brought to justice oh yeah i know you caught some actual child pornographers but what about me
ShitRedditSays,removed,still dont think pedophiles should be made into pariahs having a fetish shouldnt be illegal acting out a fetish in a way that hurts others however should its like people who have foot fetishes i dont personally get it you know but as long as you dont tackle women in the street force their shoes off and jack off on their feet i dont care if you decide to do that though i think the fbi or whoever should bring you to justice and fuck your private ip bullshit boo hoo foot fucker
ShitRedditSays,removed,as much as i would love to be a mod of this proactive highenergy community i am at odds with what i perceive to be a general lack of any real exposure or effectiveness in regards to the larger reddit body if i were running things reddit would have corrected its course or burned to the ground years ago that is because i am a god with a big penis so naturally i can operate at a significantly higher ability then the coach class archangelles as it stands the fempire™ stagnates while treading water which is an impressive feat in and of itself when viewed from a particular perspective but not conducive to the fempires overall success at bringing this problematic hub of vile misogyny and bigotry to its knees point of fact on the fempires watchokay you with me on the fempires watchyou know i mean check this out on the fempires watchno wait just listen to what im trying to say here on the fempires watchnow now hold on just so we can all land on the same page at once here on the fempires watch a vast an cancerous community of evil xenophobia homophobia misogyny and racism thrived on reddit it thrived so much that in the span of nine months a sub called the donald was able to eclipse srs in both sub count and traffic by magnitudes this is unacceptable team unacceptable looking ahead i am going to need to see vast improvements on the part of the fempire moderation team and the community at large before i throw my hat into the mod ring i need to feel confident that i will be getting at least some return on my time investment here until then i wish you luck in your future prospects and sincerely hope you are able to pull yourselves out of this slump regards gxf of the big penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,not really random when he actually did have a year old wife
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i mean in an ideal world they wouldnt have to hide their fantasies in shame just like a drug or alcohol addict shouldnt have to hide if they need help they should get it without fear of being labelled satan
ShitRedditSays,removed,the almighty phallus turns straight men gay and makes lesbians lose their gold star s
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is just a bad joke i dont even understand why people would get offended by it
ShitRedditSays,removed,hamas fired rockets at a preschool but for some reason we need to talk about how horrible israel is im jewish and i really wish i had a community i could go where people simultaneously dont demonize palestinians or israelis like i see plenty wrong with the stuff israel does but the fact is that hamas spits in their face any time they make an overture towards peace and in the meantime the israeli government has to protect its citizens from a group that is perfectly willing to kill as many civilians as possible and considers it justified the fact is as much as i like to stand with the underdog in a fight sometimes the underdog is the underdog because he is wrong the other proisrael person who commented is correct israel doesnt want to exterminate the palestinians they want to be left the hell alone hamas has the goal of killing the jews of israel in its charter hamas attacks civilian centers because they want to kill innocent victims israel attacks civilian centers because thats where hamas chooses to stage their attacks from israel warns people before bombing them hamas deliberately attacked a preschool because they thought it still had kids in it it doesnt matter when israel unilaterally withdraws from territory it wouldnt matter if they were to do everything that people say they should do to end the conflict hamas wants their people to be poor scared and angry and peace wont do that for them you cant force peace on a terrorist group that doesnt want it this is not apartheid its two nations in a conflict with each other that the loser refuses to allow to end and no israel clearly isnt overly concerned with the welfare of the palestinian people but its quite difficult to take responsibility for the welfare of a nation that considers itself in permanent war with you i mean jesus fuck how are you supposed to deal with that money invested in the region is used by hamas to buy weapons and build tunnels same with food and building materials what infrastructure they didnt destroy is used as launching points for more rockets because they know that when israel retaliates of the bad pr will be on israel do you guys not remember the and terrorists were putting bombs in nightclubs and buses they would set two bombs ten minutes apart in order to kill first responders as well they have to make these settlements because they need buffer areas around major cities and airports otherwise planes would be getting shot out of the sky i cant imagine having to live like that and the fact is that it can all end tomorrow if hamas were to disarm and disavow attacks on israeli cities and civilians people say things like i dont hate jews i just hate israel and the people who support it but the vast vast majority of us do support israel even when we criticize it and it makes me feel like im just sort of barely tolerated around here because open antisemitism that isnt couched in antiisrael vocabulary is verboten the rhetoric is so overthetop and exaggerated comparing us to apartheid south africa and nazi germany when theyre literally nothing alike that i cant help but read some actual antisemitism into it nobody here talks about the jews expelled from arab lands nobody here talks about the yemeni jews who were almost entirely driven out and whose remnants experience intense persecution daily do you know where those jews went to israel the one place in the world we have where we can be safe even if it means being demonized for not trying harder to negotiate with freaking hamas
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree with this
ShitRedditSays,removed,been getting some choice pms about this shit show got one about half an hour ago from a guy who wants me to take this post down because it might make rsanctionedsuicide look shitty when rsanctionedsuicide does and says shitty things go another from someone else who asked without a shred of irony quick question do you really think cunt is a sexist word i dont want to hop into the whirring mess that is that specific thread but ive been wondering for the last few hours whether or not you wereare being serious fucking hell reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get what youre saying and i absolutely agree that maledominated society is a real problem i just wish more people would realize that such a society affects many men negatively as well such as by placing certain expectations of greatness on us along with a slew of gender stereotypes not incomparable to those suffered by women i dont think this comment belongs on shitredditsays because it doesnt even mention women peoples problems are relative just because someones issues seem like a smaller deal to you doesnt make them any less real i see absolutely no reason to make fun of this comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,psst rule x is a thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,only one of those crimes has evidence the comparison is dishonest since most rape kits never get tested or are tried after the fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,my mom also worked very hard that doesnt change the fact that men statistically work more hours than women and are statistically more willing to sacrifice their health or comfort to advance their career im not talking about opinions or anecdotes here thats a good point about social class for sure a male aristocrat was born with inherent value as they were expected to fulfill a leading role in society unless youre a member of the however that does not apply to you
ShitRedditSays,removed,women and children first a random woman had higher societal value than a random man whether they could vote doesnt really reflect on that a parent might care more about their child than they do about their friends but when making day to day decisions they are more likely to ask their friends for advice than they are to ask their children for advice this is the attitude society took towards women paternalistic which i would say is all a result of womens inherent worth women are biologically valuable societies which protected them did better protected them even by limiting their choices no military service no hazardous work no engaging in dangerous politicking eventually women werent expected to do almost anything for themselves except make babies which from a biological standpoint is the most important thing that anyone can ever do they werent educated at the level of men they werent expected to hold public office or fight wars or learn a trade or explore or negotiate etc etc so why would their opinion be relevant this is the same reason that for a long time poor people couldnt vote they were uneducated and they werent expected to do much so who cares what they think of course women occasionally did all that shit anyway more and more leading up to womens lib but it wasnt what they were expected to do by society
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry if this is super ignorant but can you explain why you posted their comment isnt it true that transwomen dont menstruate
ShitRedditSays,removed,us bureau of labor statistics httpwwwblsgovnewsreleasepdfatuspdf university of berkeley
ShitRedditSays,removed,the second link suggests that men are more willing to sacrifice their relationships to further their career heres a ey global generations survey with more direct results yes women spend more time homemaking this ties into their traditional role i dont know about the blackwhite disparity but that doesnt reflect on the malefemale one since the govt data only included employed people and the discrepancy held even for people with full time employment men find social worth through career advancement something they must work for women find social worth through having babies something they are born able to do its either sexist or biologically obvious whichever you prefer but what you are saying isnt disagreeing with what i am saying
ShitRedditSays,removed,i amended my comment shortly after posting because i realized it could easily be misconstrued traditionally and to a great extent today women find social worth through having babies you say that society pushes women away from careers and into childcaring but you call me misogynist when i say that women find social worth through having babies were saying the same thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,excuse us were cherry picking data and extrapolating based on our own preconceived ideas about reddit here none of that examine the broader picture before passing judgement on the whole thinking here thank you very much
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont live in hamerica fucking roman with your bowling
ShitRedditSays,removed,eva lion
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fuck you say about my dear sweetheart geraldo you little bitch ill have you know i graduated at the top of my class in doxxing academy and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on srs with over confirmed triggerings
ShitRedditSays,removed,retourne doù tu vienslenfer féministe de merde
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe the gaming community is made up of all different kinds of people maybe the people whinging about feminists whinging and the no mans sky whingers were from completely different sets of whingers maybe we shouldnt judge a community as a whole based on comments made from its constituent parts did i use that properly lets resist the tribalism urge yeah not all gamers
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe not the same punishment but one close in severity false rape accusations can form hate mobs and persecution towards people who committed no crime and it should be punished severely
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,test comment please ignore
ShitRedditSays,removed,things are looking bad for damp nutlord
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people are beyond delusional holy fuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,so instead of making fun of an arabic guy we can make fun of the welsh
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol and this complaint is just as unoriginal but truly redditors are not meant to be trusted
ShitRedditSays,removed,kill yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,but thats censorship let people say there edgy jokes but dont censor them
ShitRedditSays,removed,one of their own im sorry but memers hate prank artists like joey salads but memers i mean the idubbz crowd everyone makes fun of this fuckwad who not to mentioned pissed in his own mouth
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think its kind of funny its mostly making fun of otherkin not trans gender people
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh to each there own everyone is a little racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you serious if so they probably feel the same as the french do when everyone is talking about removing baguette they dont give a shit because its a game at utc slayje replied to are you serious if so they probably feel the same as the french do when everyone is talking about removing baguette they dont give a shit because its a game
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry but i mostly agree that if you marry a pituitary case whos in the nba you should expect that hell cheat and probably not just once i feel similarly about the meathead nfl guys theyre serial cheaters i dont think its right or even that these guys have the right but i think its true i think that the majority of their wivesgirlfriends accept it or at least dont leave because of it id also add musicians to the serial cheater category i also think that a certain percentage of the women decide that the lifestyle is worth it worth staying despite the infidelity
ShitRedditSays,removed,downvoting shit is good here right
ShitRedditSays,removed,please call us gay homosexual sounds awkward and is sometimes used as a right wing dogwhistle dont pussyfoot around it please
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah no shit what are you like twelve who the fuck abuses ellipses like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,killallmen
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the person who said theres that fag talk again was merely referencing a movie he likes and the line hes referencing is again satirical so i suppose youre right the poster isnt really making fun of casual homophobia rather the user is just parroting lines but still that shouldnt implicate the user as being casually homophobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,in the context of the movie the line is spoken by complete dolts in a manner meant to exaggerate the way a lot of people talk
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub is beyond garbage and why do you type like that mocking someone on the internet because you dont like their joke so you write like a child
ShitRedditSays,removed,y chromosome was a mistake
ShitRedditSays,removed,even if theres evidence a woman is lying we should still believe her allegations like jackie or that duke stripper
ShitRedditSays,removed,ummm alan turing and charles babbage are men
ShitRedditSays,removed,im gay and i vote right
ShitRedditSays,removed,legit question why isnt this funny isnt it just poking harmless fun
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you not get humour this is clearly a joke and most people agree that it should be a thing this site is full of peoplle who will make jokes about everything
ShitRedditSays,removed,white people own most things you can claim ownership over so destruction of private property or lol public propertyproperty is sacred remember thats why we hate environmental activists toois literally white genocide jeez its like you arent reading our newsletter or something altright virgins
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought sex was chromosomedna and gender was social mental construct based on generalizationslabels of each sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,well look at this guy over here being the top authority on what is and isnt funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i gotta agree with the asians on this one
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah theyre entitled to the opinions even the absolute worst of the worst shit you can think of but you can still vocally protest them disagree etc just dont smash other peoples stuff thats no fun discourse everybody discourse
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,does the same go for the lynchings of the past pretty sure white people are heard pretty clearly nonviolence is important
ShitRedditSays,removed,im pretty sure it was made to be obscure satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,where is this coming from
ShitRedditSays,removed,like muslim migrants in europe s
ShitRedditSays,removed,im from caucasus and this applies to me too
ShitRedditSays,removed,if black people dont finish school get arrested dont find employment and dont pay bills then that is going to hurt them and guess what it should that isnt the fault of white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,its also impossible to have reasonable discourse when you believe it is appropriate to treat people like tyrannical oppressors based on their race and sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,man youre missing out if you havent had sex with a black chick dude
ShitRedditSays,removed,the instant you lay a hand on another student it ceases to be a protest and becomes assault under the definition of the law the definition of peaceful protest is objective and not open to interpretation and the instant they shoved andor physically restrained the first person trying to go through the line they were no longer peaceful i hope they all get kicked out of school
ShitRedditSays,removed,watimes is indeed borderline fascist but the youtube video speaks for itself lots of pushingshoving not peaceful by any stretch
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not an inconvenience it was assault if you are laying hands on another person without their consent including to physically restrain them or as shown in the video pushshove them you are a violent criminal zero subjectivity here if theyd stood on the bridge let students pass but shouted things at them itd have been fine this was not fine
ShitRedditSays,removed,when someone lays hands on someone else it goes from being a protest to being assault stand on the bridge and yell all you want wave all the signs you want but the instant you physically restrain another human youve committed assault i home one of the people on the video who got shoved back presses charges
ShitRedditSays,removed,and having more and more female engineers will probably go a long ways towards fixing this
ShitRedditSays,removed,at this point it would take a massive systemic polling error across multiple states for him to win with modern early voting hes basically already missed the bus even if there was some kind of truly seismic surprise it might not be enough
ShitRedditSays,removed,i like to think that theyll just keep on rallying forever like the japanese soldiers who hid in caves on okinawa for years after had ended i look forward to some trumpbro brag about turning the rust belt red in forever frozen in time
ShitRedditSays,removed,and its a glorious pedestal in a great neighborhood with really terrific schools and a whole foods
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill just leave this here
ShitRedditSays,removed,go fuck yourself with a rusty trowel
ShitRedditSays,removed,just watch the video you dont have to read the article to get that these protesters are out of line i dont get how you guys can defend these people
ShitRedditSays,removed,sup ama guy who made the comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this your genuine opinion or supposed to be satire i dont understand
ShitRedditSays,removed,true but some people fight hate with more hate and violence with violence abd thats what this poster meant imo
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i am aware of that but would you agree that if i made the same assumption most x race people have y point of wiev about people if color you would consider my comment srs worthy if so isnt your comment stereotypical towards people that think differently than majirity of their racewhite voting right wing in this case
ShitRedditSays,removed,the most accepted theory is simply life choices the wage game does exist but the cause is almost always personal choices in your career pregnancy is the main factor into why women are paid less since they miss out on nearly a year per child of work that a man wouldnt miss due to not having paternity leave thats a years worth of bonuss and experience missed out on because of a personal choice
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant think of a reason myself because my highschool and university never did anything to discriminate against women telling them to choose a different field or anything my exgirlfriend is currently a mechanical engineer and shes said theirs been no discrimination against her whatsoever what i do know about business though is that the primary cause of the wage gap has to do with personal choices the biggest one being pregnancy taking maternity leave takes away close to year out of your career per child thats a years worth of bonuss and experience that a man wouldnt be losing out on
ShitRedditSays,removed,rthepaygap
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would be hard pressed to find most people pressuring a women to get pregnant perhaps in some social circles like certain christian groups but i dont think most progressive people are telling ladies that they need to have a child if she so chooses then she should know that shes sacrificing money in return for that on the other note i do think its wrong that say paternity leave is so frowned upon or that if the women is the breadwinner she should still be the one to take the time off regardless both my mom and aunt are the breadwinners my mom just barely but my uncle definitely loses out in that department and he took paternity leave in absence of her maternity leave which i thought was an excellent move on their part
ShitRedditSays,removed,stherapygas chamber
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair she thought it was funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,its racial not racist if it was instead squares comparing obama and a bonobo chimp on top and on the bottom colin powell and a baboon and said i cant tell the difference that would be racist and actually comparing someone to chimp honestly i think the humor is that it is funny to make light of a gorilla being killed using the dealing people had of hopelessness that was portrayed in the film i swear you uberleft are far too sensitive
ShitRedditSays,removed,ignoring the whole theyre all wrong argument why even dignify something that has proven repeatedly to be a force of social regression nobody said we were going to dignify what is just an ideological symptom we can turn the churches into yearround haunted houses religion and its vacuous cousin spirituality which is really the same symptom is too slippery a category to be meaningful and more symptoms of late capitalistpostcolonial systems of knowledge which have taken a heavy lead from protestantism and that goes for atheism too any working definition you offer is going to apply to things that arent religion and exclude things that by commonsense are religion but thats a bigger discussion and really getting in the way the skeleton jerk warship tldr gulags for the worshippers gulags for the atheists who think we care what they dont care about gulags for the academics who insist on propping up this stupid concept
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,because i identify as negative space
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive been trying to bring awareness to rstarlettes so that maybe something can be done about it but my posts keep getting removed it appears to be a subreddit to post girls that are too young to post in rstarlets they even require you to list their age in the title so you are explicitly aware of how young the children are that they are sexualizing i dont even want to discuss to the comments on the posts there i dont see why this is allowed to exist on the site and why every subreddit ive tried to raise my concern on have removed me im hoping that this one can see my concern
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was obviously satire jesus christ
ShitRedditSays,removed,awesome more protestors should get squish squished
ShitRedditSays,removed,so basically racism dont real you brainless jobless monkeys or the classic lack of self awareness weve all come to loathe
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love how obvious it is that the person who did the video editing is so obviously on the guys side you have got to go down parent comments before you have someone saying uh this guy has people coming to his totallynotabusiness garage every day
ShitRedditSays,removed,technically he really didnt he merely told people to do the attrocities and they listened he personally never murdered anyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,well why is all black housing not racist even by institutional racism standards this is racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,hitler did nothing wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,this kids story is utterly ridiculous and completely unbelievable clearly they are just making things up for attention also the dads reply reflects my beliefs precisely and is wordforword what i would have said in that situation smug
ShitRedditSays,removed,no offense but i think you need to step back for a minute because you are coming off as extremely condescending someone liking sports or video game tournaments does not make them less intelligent or whatever else than you are
ShitRedditSays,removed,the stuff you cucks post here is best of reddit tbh fam
ShitRedditSays,removed,but men are superior to women i mean have you take a look at the world nearly everything done by men exclusively
ShitRedditSays,removed,what are you talking about freddie gray who inspired some of the largest blm protests was killed by black officers keep reading p
ShitRedditSays,removed,does that make the comment any less valid or truthful op is probs a racist how is that any better than hes black so hes probably a criminal comment above wanted to twist words into the victim is just a black despite that not being said theres plenty of actual racism out there why do we feel the need to twist the words of people and make up enemies that arent there you start fucking with a guy because hes black or asian or muslim ill get in the middle and shut your shit down but similarly if people want to twist words and deliberately make issues where there are none then ill tell them to go get fucked because it does nothing but diminish the plight of those who are actually disadvantaged by questioning the credibility of the entire argument
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey look its me
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i hope you dont end up eradicating trans women in that vendetta
ShitRedditSays,removed,men think with their tiny little dicks allthefuckingtime
ShitRedditSays,removed,gas the whites
ShitRedditSays,removed,imho this also belongs to shitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds more like he wanted to be considerate to the fact she may not have wanted him to cum inside her and so took a safer course of action ie not finishing inside her or on her face the terminology might be crude but his reasoning seems perfectly acceptable
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would you shame someone for their sexual preferences can a man not enjoy sex in silence without being judged for it
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh forgive me you morally superior entity xdd
ShitRedditSays,removed,he got a point
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey dont lump us all together that sort of thing is the go to fare of teen comedies
ShitRedditSays,removed,we should just enslave all males and only use their semen to reproduce
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think we should burn white people on crosses
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow those crackers should get raped with dragon dildos and beheaded
ShitRedditSays,removed,imo white people should not be allowed to become cops or any type of workers for that matter they should all be enslaved and work in farms
ShitRedditSays,removed,talking during sex referring to your comment is not pillow talk im indian although i fail to see what my race has to do with this
ShitRedditSays,removed,schumer was mediocre a few years ago before anyone really knew her specifically when she would make appearances on the opie anthony radio show she was also the polar opposite of what shes become now especially politically people tear her apart for absolutely everything but the fact that she is a woman is really the last thing on their minds shes a lying thief more than anything and the people that are involved in and care about comedy know it if she were a male with a very heavy political stance agenda it wouldnt be any different
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sent a screenshot of your usernameflair to my group chat im to impressed for words
ShitRedditSays,removed,racial slur aside how can you justify shaming a person for their sexual preferences
ShitRedditSays,removed,by force kill all white males imo
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you defending white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not white but i think games should be as accurate historically as possible even if it means removing certain races or reducing their higher prevalence
ShitRedditSays,removed,the key to ending racism is completely disregarding their race do not acknowledge someone by their race the colour of someones skin shouldnt matter when youre working with an individual
ShitRedditSays,removed,omg so
ShitRedditSays,removed,right now i am angry good we love salty sjw tears
ShitRedditSays,removed,youve already had a space reserved for you in the oven sincerly tired of jews
ShitRedditSays,removed,she is only white when its conveient she self idetifies as a jew
ShitRedditSays,removed,way to counteract the stereotype
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow how did i just know youd assume i was white way to stereotype dipshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,rshitliberalssay
ShitRedditSays,removed,hillary deserves anyones vote about as little as trump both of those imperialist warmongers can rot
ShitRedditSays,removed,me too every day i become less liberal and more tankie
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey look its something serious happening and someone used a word i dont like because it might be offensive djeez fucking christ at first i thought this subreddit was irony a parody but now i just look at this subreddit for fun but seriously this is happening a coup of the turkys government which has tried to make itself big on a geopolitic level and you are seriously butthurt about the fact that someone used mongoloid the worst thing of the whole article is that someone used the word mongoloid thats all you are getting at i really hope it is just karmawhoring that you are after and you found the right subreddit for it but please tell me at least it was for karma and you dont really care about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,so far the most racist people that ive ever met have all been black
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh madd and their dastardly plot to keep people from getting drunk and killing people in car accidents madd targets mothers at funerals of victims of drunk drivers these parents knowingly in a highly painful emotional state get a circle of friends and very very quickly put on a speakers circuit going from high school to high school telling their painful story this isnt a paying gig they dont even get hotel rooms in reality madd charges in excess of an hour for these talks at schools and these unfortunate mothers are simply used as crying props moved from city to city when they become burnt out they are replaced madd has a dreadful reputation in how they take advantage of the mothers they claim to represent it is important to realize that madd isnt the same organization it was in the when its founder left it has become a cult against drinking in general not against drinking and driving
ShitRedditSays,removed,damn you need to calm down reddit shouldnt be taken so seriously literally your entire life revolves around race baiting on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,dude this is like if hitler asked his supporters to take to the streets to stop the reichstag fire tayyip is indefensible from a leftwing perspective
ShitRedditSays,removed,iraq had a secular military dictator too good to see that srs is lining up with the politics of donald trump
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you really think this though you must have lead a very sheltered life to brandish a billion people a joke if you went out and took everyone at face value without making any presumptions based on unchangeable and inconsequential traits youd live a happier life
ShitRedditSays,removed,but if those statistics are legitimate
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks bro
ShitRedditSays,removed,i keep trying to comment in srsd threads then remembering im banned im pretty bummed out the mods never got back to me about why i was banned
ShitRedditSays,removed,weird wheres the srs hitlist again i havent ever seen it hello hi can anyone direct me to the list of names and doxx information that we keep on reddit users
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry for disrupting the circlequeef but what is the general stance of the nazi getting punched i dont think nazis should be debated they are a dangerous threat but i also do not condole any violence im kinda unsure about the whole situation
ShitRedditSays,removed,bludgeoning them to death no shootingbombingbayoneting them to death sure thats the golden age of american anti fascism what history classes did these dipshits skip to think that fascism was ever defeated with words
ShitRedditSays,removed,it funny how you put mens rights on the same level of the nazi alt right you must be an obese lesbian feminist with cat eye glasses
ShitRedditSays,removed,males come on idiocy is gender neutral youre giving srs a bad rap saying stuff like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,these people feel impotent and enraged a lot more than for a second
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit is one person
ShitRedditSays,removed,hmm i wonder why that shit is only allowed in the us its almost as if we have some kind of freedom of speech
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is wrong with this statement please enlighten me
ShitRedditSays,removed,christians from those countries cant enter the us too why do people care only about muslims are people that racists here
ShitRedditSays,removed,you are aware that being overweight has serious health implications right that its not just societal norms instead of using poor people women and minorities as comparisons here i think it would be much more accurate to compare it to being a smoker because being a smoker is a choice a person makes thats undeniably bad for their health whereas being a woman is not and as someone who lost and kept it off with great difficulty i can say unequivocally that it is a choice not an easy choice but then neither is giving up smoking
ShitRedditSays,removed,i understand your sentiment but ive literally neveri really dont think im that remarkable for never feeling the urge to blame an entire race for something that pissed me off
ShitRedditSays,removed,looks like the sarcasm in that post is going right over your heads
ShitRedditSays,removed,or just dont visit the sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,people are right when people call this sub the joke police
ShitRedditSays,removed,the joke isnt that the person is coming back from rehab the joke is that its a sign saying something that most people wouldnt exactly want to announce to the world
ShitRedditSays,removed,noted unisex name pablo definitely bears the same scrutiny
ShitRedditSays,removed,its mostly due to their high risk lifestyles
ShitRedditSays,removed,no i dont support that but i was talking solely about your statement about pushing the party leftward every time i see that i see red because it just means that were going to get eight years of donald trump its like a flimsier version of accelerationism in that were willing to sacrifice the underprivileged just to look as left as possible as for all of president obamas flaws i guess that everything hes done wrong seems like small peanuts compared to whats incoming so im more inclined to focus on what hes done right over eight years
ShitRedditSays,removed,the issue is that economically we have no choice but to shift rightward if we want a chance in obama ran to the right of john kerry who ran to the right of al gore who ran to the left of bill clinton does the lack of a real left option in the us suck absolutely but the fact of the matter is that the american voting populace also sucks and is mostly rightleaning
ShitRedditSays,removed,ansyn is just another name for communism ancom is the same thing you add anarchy on because you see that socialist systems always result in authoritarianism oh no but our communism is anarchic you been reading ocalan or something
ShitRedditSays,removed,is my reddit glitching or does every single comment here have massive down votes
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats meatspace it sounds really hot
ShitRedditSays,removed,eskimo is a slur
ShitRedditSays,removed,sing our hymens as we overate d y s p h o r i a g l o r i a in el chansey cheeto d y s p h o r i a g l o r i a in el chansey cheeto
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop being a baby jokes are jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,welcome to the fempire please feel free to chop off your penis and donate it to blm
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is an honor to be brigaded by you worthless sjw cuck scum d
ShitRedditSays,removed,the post was actually about people playing music too loud generally not about rap music in particular
ShitRedditSays,removed,they didnt tho commenters below did and then op responded in a rude way yes but he didnt make it about race in the first place
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe you should read my comment before down voting me and making easy but false allegations that i didnt read the article i correctly said that the article only makes a case that the word spade has been used as a racial slur and those quotes do not disprove that they never cite a single use of the expression call a spade a spade being used as a racist phrase im not looking for an argument here but if i had written that as an essay in college i would have gotten an f its just a sloppy thesis
ShitRedditSays,removed,lots of great victim shameblame in the comments
ShitRedditSays,removed,no the commenter clarified that as assumed by some comments the person was in fact black he didnt then say or imply that was the reason he was playing loud music at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh try again trans people are more likely to get into prostitution because they are discriminated against by actual jobs its not like people are taking shotguns and going hunting we as a countrynot government just need better services for people born with this condition and trans deaths would decline
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean thats a fair point but the guy in the video wasnt just stealing he was pointing a gun at people
ShitRedditSays,removed,well if someone is waving a gun around its a different kind of robbery isnt it
ShitRedditSays,removed,take a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry i wasnt aware trans people were being killed for simply being trans where i live the only ones being killed are prostitutes
ShitRedditSays,removed,describing reddit as a singular thing is just a futile effort
ShitRedditSays,removed,of course not i and many of my rdrama compatriots would not do such a thing but would happily call a white suspect cumskin mayo etc because it feels pretty nice to have a moral high ground to be an asshole to someone and no im not being sarcastic thats what im doing all the time you can check my comment history you have a powerful ally in rdrama too bad you dont realize it
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is no such thing as an actual revolution you are replacing one oligarchy with another to insert the word anarchy into your political ideology is disingenuous anarchic communism or syndicalismcentralization is a contradiction in terms now i get the conceit that syndicalism isnt collectivism but of course it is and cant function in any other way how else can a society without wages or private property function
ShitRedditSays,removed,wasnt srs actually doxxybrigadey some years ago i think i read some post by an old admin talking about how srs used to be a real pain in the ass until they bannedsubdued the ringleaders
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey thats me
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dunno not to break rulex but im a christian ancap and i tend to see a lot of generalizations of the overall ideology yea many adherents are pretty callous prejudice and borderline unsympathetic but ive also met many that are very into environmentalism and social justice it all comes down to the individual
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty sure its a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought the very nice short sentences easy to understand was funny and sounded pretty antitrump
ShitRedditSays,removed,good job its almost like youre completely sane in the head made some good points there s
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this subreddit satire you guys are really invested in making people think you are some weird sjw cult lmao keep it up fam
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean couldnt he just be referring to the fact that two guys produce more semen than one girl and one guy
ShitRedditSays,removed,but a lot of the vocal ones are very racist yeah it doesnt come with the horrors that black people had in the us in the etc but its still racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,you say that as if its a known truth which is simply not true
ShitRedditSays,removed,they didnt though are you completely unaware of the existence of context the senator used it to shut down conversation the commenter didnt and just like a history book describing racism in the us can use the n word its not wrong here either strawbird
ShitRedditSays,removed,this guy is completely sane
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpswwwgooglenlsearchtbmischqcoolimage
ShitRedditSays,removed,divisive politics go home
ShitRedditSays,removed,i never realized that reddit openly and actively supports a terrorist organization thats kind of scary you should all be ashamed of yourselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is a slur my friend and even if you claim it for yourself please dont use it as a blanket term for all lgbt people
ShitRedditSays,removed,racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a weak dull witted and self adsorbed white man its never not beneficial to grace others with my genius and charm ftfy gotta be specific nowadays because criticizing a white person means that you criticize the whole caucasian race we might trigger someone
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get the rape part but whats misogynistic about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,well it is a word that critisizes someone for not fitting neatly into the gender binary soooooo
ShitRedditSays,removed,ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh im not really a fan of this term and i dont think we should use it thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you folks not really understand satire south park is a comedy show not a news show how in the world does that fit into your narrative the guy took a shot at a joke not being an ass but im not sure how anyone would be offended on this one
ShitRedditSays,removed,just because redditors say something doesnt mean they cant be right in most cases they arent but how about the nobel prize winning economists that agree with them are they not experts enough for you peoples prejudices
ShitRedditSays,removed,doesnt post a single study
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a terrible sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,well as milton friedman once said im on your side the problem is that you arent in reference to women being less and the measures through which this can be corrected
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are multiple things wrong with this though it helps nobody and its just a bunch of people who need to feel superior to the average redditor and circle jerking over out of context statements the views held here are often extreme and if you disagree youre downvoted to oblivion because srs is a safe space want an example the recent south park post about south park being more factual at reporting the news than the news nobody actually believes this but the comments suggest every redditor gets their news off of south park in reality people feel so much mistrust from the media that theyre upvoting it to bring humour to the shit situation that the msm is currently in
ShitRedditSays,removed,heres a quote although additional research in this area is clearly needed this study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action indeed there may be nothing to correct the differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers
ShitRedditSays,removed,as long as i look like a man ill still get the job
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you just assume his qualifications
ShitRedditSays,removed,it must be so satisfying to win lawsuit after lawsuit against companies that dont hire you right right
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh come on srs it isnt apparent if op is correct or not as far as i know theres no data on this based on a perusal of muslim forums on this website it has at least a surface plausibility this hardly deserves mockery smug islamophilia much
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant honestly believe that you or anyone would take that much time responding to the content i made do you think this discourse that youve come up with means anything to me on a separate point you dont have to be rich to leave poor mexicans leave mexico all the time
ShitRedditSays,removed,male comics are significantly funnier than female ones
ShitRedditSays,removed,all he did was state his opinion goddamn
ShitRedditSays,removed,your analogy only works if the drunk person doesnt consent to sex anyway comparing sex to running someone over doesnt work because even when someone consents to being run over it isnt going to end well and will do harm to them whereas consenting to sex may lead to a nice time and because running someone over is illegal whereas having sex isnt a better analogy would be feeding someone a cupcake when theyre on a diet but dispite them being on a diet theyre drunk so they say theyre not on a diet hows the person who feeds it to them meant to know that they dont actually want the cupcake so they feed them the cupcake anyway the person who ate the cupcake when sober has no right to complain about the other person feeding them the cupcake
ShitRedditSays,removed,because he likes male comedians more than female comedians lots of people prefer different gendered comics actors singers
ShitRedditSays,removed,then the drunk driving analogy works perfectly if drunk people cannot consent if we dont expect people to make decisions while drunk or not to allow themselves to get so drunk that they cant make informed decisions for themselves then a drunk person is not at fault for getting behind the wheel while intoxicated
ShitRedditSays,removed,in other words i dont have an actual argument so im going to talk about eating poop in a cancerous subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,seems like a double standard to me we hold drunk drivers to account for getting drunk and choosing to drive a car but we dont hold people to account for getting drunk and choosing to consent to sex and you seem to assume that having sex with someone is always acting to harm them which it isnt thats the difference between running someone over and having sex with someone
ShitRedditSays,removed,then why respond
ShitRedditSays,removed,honest question what do you hope to gain by commenting the way that you do if you arent just trolling yourself that is
ShitRedditSays,removed,man i get called a lot of names here
ShitRedditSays,removed,then you bring me back to the fact that if you think consent only works if someone is sober because you cannot make that decision when drunk then drunk drivers cannot be held accountable for choosing to drive
ShitRedditSays,removed,one guy said why not just say dont call me that not much you uh coz thats a kinda weird way to put it im pretty sure the reason theyre all upset isnt her response its that it was a closed response and not an open one she basically rejected him for no reason what a bitch s
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats wrong with this
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes i have always thought that since paedophilia isnt something one can chose to have society should take pity on these people rather than hate them this argument of course does not apply to transgender individuals because theyre just attention seeking whores or something
ShitRedditSays,removed,but its a joke tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,fun is not allowed no fun rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats so bad about this
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is funny though thats why its being upvoted why dont you just learn to accept things like silly stereotypes and learn to laugh about them your life will be go much more smoothly
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys just sit here raging at jokes made on reddit that doesnt sound very fun or healthy i guess its better than just feeling powerless and frustrated that its only in this subreddit you can enforce your view of free speech which is really just selective censorship
ShitRedditSays,removed,its called a joke i know you people all have sticks unconsensually shoved in your asses but please learn to take a joke a joke is much easier to take than the stick
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,doesnt seem to be racist so much as a mockery of indias poverty and lack common lack of amenities that are considered essentials in the western world
ShitRedditSays,removed,kind of considering that comedy is considered a legitimate form of bringing awareness to a serious social issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is a joke more indians have mobiles than toilets its not that they cant make toilets a lot of them can but they wont the govt even paid for it but there are village leaders who destroyed it it is shameful that people chose to ignore the importance of cleanliness and be so entitled to not clean their crap and the comment was clearly a joke and more in clear sarcasm to add india would probably have the most toilets or amenities but it still has the largest number of people with them also posting on reddit or online isnt going to change it as those people dont have access to it so it is pointless to educate about it online india has a whole govt program for it you cant educate the stubborn though
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,well thats because its satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,never said it wasnt most of the posts people rage about on this sub are just low effort satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,uhuh sure in the right context that would be considered harassment or a crude joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean i want to relieve her body from her head as much as the next person but the sexism i hear from bernie and trump supporters makes me want to give myself a lobotomy
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you even revolutionary socialism bro
ShitRedditSays,removed,using a throwaway account to shitpost
ShitRedditSays,removed,dickhead pls dont use gendered insults im a gentle flower and dont like it
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt reddit has a large userbase who is still in hs and it is summer sooooo
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a shit hole because they thing people should be proved guilty before convicted are you all fucking insane
ShitRedditSays,removed,so i came across this post earlier and did find it funny and i dont usually post much on reddit but seeing it mentioned here made me want to get some more input given that all the users other posts are all similar id assume its kindve a running gag right obviously its pretty low hanging fruit but its just a novelty account that cashed in at the right time and in the right place its similar humour to a lot of american sitcom type shows right im thinking simpsons married with children everybody loves raymond i think this post is obviously on the extreme end of the spectrum and doesnt offer any redemption to the ops character but thats kindve the point in offensive humour
ShitRedditSays,removed,humor is subjective using fancy words doesnt make your solipsistic views on comedy legitimate triggering isnt a new concept to poke fun at something dates back long before online anonymity removed any downside of agitate humor the free market of opinions really disagrees with you
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes because you are so morally superior to all of reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,all of reddit yourself included this sub hates generalization and yet they allow such behavior to persist so long as it conforms to their beliefs
ShitRedditSays,removed,rather than have a thoughtful discussion you resort to silence not strange behavior considering the fallacy of your beliefs
ShitRedditSays,removed,can i get banned from this shithole of a subreddit i hate trump as much as you but ill vote for him if it means putting an end to this social justice shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,it says a lot when i would vote for someone who i despise and dont call me a fuckstick im getting triggered so hard
ShitRedditSays,removed,l
ShitRedditSays,removed,id totally go gay if the other dude had a vag and boobs a wider pelvis displayed a feminine build and female secondary sex characteristics lacked masculine traits had a generally higher voice and had a genotype including two x sex chromosomes only which expressed as usual phenotypically i think my wants are reasonable for a newlyminted gay man that was clearly meant to be a joke lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,are people actually upset over this comment or is this a new meme u dont get
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha i knew this thread would be linked here yall bitches are so salty its great of course the village did the right thing here triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,ayy lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can totally tell from the sound of someones voice right not in disagreement with you at all but had to interject on this point there is without a doubt a change in someones voice based on body weight pretty sure it has something to do with your vocal chords loosening up or something dont quite remember
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i didnt get linked and like you im here to watch why are you trying to start something
ShitRedditSays,removed,fat people breathe heavily this is a fact it is more likely for someone to be fat than to have a respiratory condition you can hear people breathe as they talk so someone can sound fat just as they can sound out of breath lastly heavy breathing is an annoying sound
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah this reddit person is a real asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,accusing someone of being fat isnt going to ruin their entire life
ShitRedditSays,removed,all i wanted to do was enjoy a cute puppy being petscratched without having someone shit on koreans just because youre signed into reddit does not mean you have to remind everyone using the site that youre capable of typing racist things rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,humans are animals ignoramus
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is a fact what is your problem animals can forcibly copulate they cannot rape they have no moral prohibitions they are not moral agents you are
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only way you can arrive at a wage gap is if you add all the earnings not wages of men and women together and do simple division men and women do not get paid differently for the same work thats a a crime and b grounds for a lawsuit if it were actually happening women make less than men because they choose to take feminist dance therapy instead of studying electrical engineering facts dont care about your feelings
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have a cousin whose boss was recently replaced by a woman and she promptly started firing all the male employees himself included creating a more diverse allfemale workforce
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait whats wrong with appreciating the female form we can appreciate the male form as
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think anyone was implying she should be let off the hook for her actions theyre just admiring the female form you can admire the male form as well if you
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get the rape joke is bad but whats wrong with noticing a nice ass here you can admire a nice ass too if you want
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats wrong with gawking at photographs the human form can be magnificent
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant stand queers or anyone who decides to make their sexual fetish the focal point of their existence nice quote mine if any of you bother to actually read the full comment this guy makes a reasonable point people who centre their identity around arbitrary characteristics they have no control over are dull people
ShitRedditSays,removed,your doctor needs to know if you are seeking prescription medicine or taking it without a prescription i never realized that was related to being transgender thanks for the info s
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre joking right you cant actually be that dumb where the name ash is upsetting you
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a crock of utter shit and lies source
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha really youre not sending your son to college and would prefer he be a waiter feel sorry for the kid
ShitRedditSays,removed,burn the coal pay the toll
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not familiar with this whole more than physical genders thing i assumed it was all satirical can someone explain to me the logic that there could possibly be more than two physical genders
ShitRedditSays,removed,the right to freeze peach is the most basic right constitutional right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am curious of srss opinion of rblackpeopletwitter i have always found it to be strangely racist mostly because i suspect its a bunch of white kids using it as an excuse to be well racist sort of like how i notice that way too many men post their irrelevant opinions in twox apologies if im being inappropriate or out of line
ShitRedditSays,removed,ah its fake got it
ShitRedditSays,removed,well thats racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds like something a crazy nazi cockroach will say
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt see cishet what does that mean
ShitRedditSays,removed,or you could initially put forth a valid argument as to why you believe that something is racist or misogynistic that puts your claim above the criticism of being baseless just a thought
ShitRedditSays,removed,the actions of one person years ago should dictate modern discourse are you guys even trying
ShitRedditSays,removed,buzzwords are buzzwords
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol you think so get a clue and stop generalizing people i defend everyone that i see being treated unfairly i dont perceive the world as a big game in which its us vs them depending on the body that i was born in the people who think its okay to shit all over someone because of their gender or skin color are my enemies and thats you
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh my fucking shit tits ive never spoken to this part of reddit before but you really are cliche as hell come on tell me a muh vagina joke next
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand why this comment drew flak i complimented the guy saying rude things to the person who is making a regressive ass of themselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not gonna say that israel is as bad as nazi germany because it objectively isnt but they are inching closer and closer very slowly
ShitRedditSays,removed,i like to look through post histories of people like this because usually youll find some racism or bigotry and you can laugh at their obvious twofaced bullshit comment this poster seems to spend a lot of time in tumblrinaction but was also vehemently antirape culture and wrote a big post about herself being a victim so i mean i guess i see why she would be mad at some ridiculously exaggerated sjw but that doesnt give her the right to demean others because she faced hardships sorry they havent suffered up to your standards lady oh and i did find some i wish gay people would just stop flaunting it and all american blacks are racist against white people in there too but thats neither here nor there
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh ffs this is just a joke there isnt even anything offensive about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,the blm movement has done much more violent things than just block traffic i cant see the context of the post now that its removed but i could see murdering people based on race being compared to the kkk i dont think blm is comparable against the kkk but as the quote in the post is saying race based murder is definitely making it closer to the kkk than almost any other american group
ShitRedditSays,removed,this entire sub is dedicated to doing that exact thing tho lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,but dont people on this sub often do the same thing about reddit like talking about how reddit is racist etc thats pretty much just doing the same thing but about reddit as opposed to the sj community obviously neither is true generalizing is almost always wrong but you can still get what someone is saying despite doing it
ShitRedditSays,removed,ayy this me
ShitRedditSays,removed,what i meant was this entire subreddit is dedicated to generalizing this website
ShitRedditSays,removed,when we do it its okay but when they do it its wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,what i mean is the op is saying sjw get treated as one homogeneous group and every post in this sub acts like some random poster represents reddit as whole which is hypocritical
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont put words in my mouth im not saying anyone needs to pitty reddit im saying you shouldnt chastise others for doing the exact same thing you are doing yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,i understand the rules and still say a racist statement with a few hu free people that agree still doesnt represent those website as a whole topics on rthedonald get into the hundreds easily but they are still a minority subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,again dont put words in my mouth not crying here at all just pointing out the fallacy of ops statement if you cant handle that without devolving into petty trolling thats your own personal shortcomings and not my problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,no hes pointing out a double standard you being deliberately obtuse or are you just stupid or a pussy i bet your just a pussy
ShitRedditSays,removed,bookcase example of being in the wrong and yet not having enough character to admit as much feel free to continue on with your farce but its clear im in the right and i feel no need to continue our conversation
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realize that straight is and i know this might be shocking but its the norm like omg i know right i was so surprised too
ShitRedditSays,removed,cries for substance on rshitreditsays now ive truly seen it all
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one is going to wank it in the middle of a gym im pretty sure if someone does that they might have some issues they need to deal with
ShitRedditSays,removed,some women over exaggerate though i used to go to a gym with of my other friends we were olds mostly lifting that is what we came there to do one time the manager asked us to leave for harassing a female we asked what we did and he said she did not specify and asked have someone talk to us to this day none of us know which of us harassed her or what we did because we were all together for the or so minutes we were working out canceled my membership and found a new gym
ShitRedditSays,removed,these fucking pervert freaks cant look at a photo of scantily clad women without thinking about sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,gang ledaers are not the boogyman but they are capable of some nasty shit google gangbanging if youre curious
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure if a man was wraring something comparably embarassing most people wouldnt point it out either and why didnt the women point it out to that woman sjws smh
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats assuming equal compentency also less women are in business etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,muslims have a worse suicide bombing strategy than dolphins
ShitRedditSays,removed,the ass is still good though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i absolutely hate white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,some of them lied and got it somehow source the teeth marks on my wang
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would this comment have him banned incompetent mod for those of those who are interested in the actual comment which is not even egregious
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one likes your incestual subreddit anyway benned
ShitRedditSays,removed,ronexchromosome
ShitRedditSays,removed,delete your account
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe you should have done some research like i did bigot
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont assault people dont harass people is probably a better way of putting it
ShitRedditSays,removed,get over it are you seriously going through life worried about what a stranger on the internet is making a joke about
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think an year old is mature enough to make a decision like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,happy first day
ShitRedditSays,removed,m e m e o f p e a c e e m e o f p e a c e
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre really confirming the points made in the essay with this fyi
ShitRedditSays,removed,some people need mental help
ShitRedditSays,removed,how many life saving drugs for rare diseases have you came up with
ShitRedditSays,removed,damn your sisters on goblin dick early
ShitRedditSays,removed,this boys been doing well in english class hes learnt to write seven letter words
ShitRedditSays,removed,i lived in china for five years this is an understatement the chinese will fuck over anybody outside their immediate family without batting an eye true story
ShitRedditSays,removed,that would imply we respect you enough to not want you to look like a dumbass
ShitRedditSays,removed,so the most recent south park episode had a very strong pro hillary rant and also showed that online trolling can have real consequences like suicide usually reddit has a few posts about south park every week but this week i havent seen anything looks like the trumpets might be upset and dont know how to handle it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think he meant real people could be wrong though
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realize srs has been accused of brigading long before the alt right were a thing right
ShitRedditSays,removed,til in the original good will hunting script there is a surprise gay sex scene between the two straight leads it was purposely put there as a test to see if studios actually read the script harvey weinstein was the only producer who mentioned the scene so his studio got the movie
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not a brigade this stuff just doesnt really belong here
ShitRedditSays,removed,id say that the sor is kinda fucked when a person can get on it for as little as drunkenly peeing in an alley the sor and sex crime laws dont just punish child molesters and other violent sex offenders
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not what he was talking about though he was talking about people getting in for public urination or walking naked with the curtains open
ShitRedditSays,removed,i laughed
ShitRedditSays,removed,he was defending people drunkenly pissing in alleys nit grown men who fuck children you are totally misrepresenting the conversation which is exactly the point people were making you cant defend anyone on the list without assholes like you saying we support child rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ youre fucking retarded
ShitRedditSays,removed,i find that attitude despicable bodyshaming should never be all right
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you look further down that thread they mention they want well funded an proper facilities not like the ones of the past
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know that peeing in your own backyard can land you on the registry right happened to a friend of mine
ShitRedditSays,removed,just be clear all of us here are in favor of treating a child sexual predator the same as someone who gets caught peeing behind a pub right
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmfao mods just deleting everyone who disagrees
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure this redditor spends lots of time dealing with special needs people read bitching about them on the internet
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true there are two genders
ShitRedditSays,removed,a good number not all of the special needs people i have interacted with either dont understand how to act in a normal environment or are huge jerks not that its their fault all the time no they shouldnt be mistreated but an institution that was up to par wouldnt be such a bad thing this is why reddit thinks you guys are complete fuckwads you cherrypick comments without reading the rest of the thread or very few do and twist the words granted some ignorant shit needs to be pointed out but most of the time you guys look like children
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,damn hopefully those sex offenders were black asian hispanic or slavic those denominations of people are the worst oh shit sorry for triggering you guys if only i would have replaced any of the races above with white then youd all be much more accepting of my post if only racism worked both ways like in the real world good thing nobody lives in the real world then am i right haha alright stay triggered you fucking nazi degenerate extremist scum have an awful day and make sure to write a tumblr post about me a man oppressing you via the almighty allpowerful patriarchy votetrump exxonmobil vegansarejews hitlerdidnothingwrong patriarchyforpresident
ShitRedditSays,removed,white privilege the worst did you know that white people can get into college at a lower cost than other races with a lower gpa satact score and a more poorlywritten essay what an abomination arent you outraged oops that was a typo there i meant to say that minorities can get into college at a lower cost without being as appealing to colleges its called affirmative action but where im from the real world people just called it bullshit liberals plaguing our country for no reason other than the fact that theyre offended at things that slightly inconvenience them trigger warning i used the word they ps niggers
ShitRedditSays,removed,not really
ShitRedditSays,removed,you say at a computer dying slowly
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people are so willfully ignorant that its pathetic just as bad as the hard right wing in some ways id tell you all to have a nice day but lets not kid ourselves none of you are happy
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre a fucking idiot good luck with your feelings
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol youre a fucking idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah writing a quick post on reddit definitely implies that someone really cares about something
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one outside of this lame ass identity politics circle jerk cares what you heard or really what you think about anything
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a black man and the first song i remember hearing was van halens you really got me which i just learned was a cover of the kinks at utc fcbaldur replied to personally i find the whole cultural appropriation angle really stupid especially when it comes to music im a black man and the first song i remember hearing was van halens you really got me which i just learned was a cover of the kinks i grew up on rock music found raphiphop in junior high rediscovered rock and metal in highschool metalcoredeathcore in college and now i listen to a mix of anything from outrun to indie post hardcoremidwest screamo the music i identify to is we i like there should not be anything that stops you from enjoying a genre of music especially not your skin color this is probably the most batshit insane crap i heard in a while and i really hope none of you had to deal with people blaming you with cultural appropriation enjoy we you listen to
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats hard to argue with
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do realize your comment is only supporting the argument that cultural appropriation is fucking retarded right
ShitRedditSays,removed,what makes you think that its the same people saying that at that point you are just assuming its very well possible that these people also take a critical stance on police violence against minorities
ShitRedditSays,removed,i meani get what youre sayingbut metalworking was not originated from anywhere near zimbabwe it is mostly accepted to be mediterraneanarabic in origin
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a very americacentric view whats with those european nations that never had colonies to this day have african americans and still were one of the first to develop vaccines this is something that annoys me a lot on reddit how every side always frames this discussion in a very americacentric view blaming the polish or the ukrainians or the danish for the actions of the british in the us is quite short sighted they did manage to invent several modern technologies without hurting african americans — or poc immigrants in their own countries
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys really need to start separate european and american this is an american stating this most europeans dont care about this sort of garbage so stop insulting europeans over retarded shit americans say
ShitRedditSays,removed,op here we dont have many blacks in canada but the few ive met were all decent hardworking people what was said is the undeniable truth nobody is arguing supremacy just pointing out that if you dont want john to talk quickly over music you should consider skipping that surgery dumping out your prescription and walking to work from now on
ShitRedditSays,removed,european culture white is a social construct
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was born in the i havent stolen anything regardless only a handful of european countries even engaged in colonialism
ShitRedditSays,removed,op here explain the difference between cultural exchange and cultural appropriation for me then i sure hope you dont make the determination based on race because that would be well racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know anything about history but since you made the claims youve got to provide the evidence
ShitRedditSays,removed,humans are animals
ShitRedditSays,removed,not reddit as a whole just us clearly this is something that annoys me a lot on reddit did you even read what i said not their need to circle jerk about how black people never contribute to anything keep reaching another nice strawman – which i never said which most people never say and which wasnt even said in the original post you comment on
ShitRedditSays,removed,well then you can surely show me how the polish people had colonies or discriminated against african americans
ShitRedditSays,removed,im bringing it up because some people in this thread claim that people should be treated worse or allowed less just because they are white i was thinking we were trying to push same rights and treatment for everyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill shut up when everyone no matter their skin color gender or culture ancestry or religion can do the same will be treated the same gets the same opportunities compared to their peers etc same rights for everyone black or white male or female german or american nothing less nothing more no discrimination no affirmative action based on race or gender do that for all poor families instead please but for everyone to be treated the same
ShitRedditSays,removed,its kind of ironic reading this comment in a sub dedicated to lumping all white men in a group and hating them
ShitRedditSays,removed,dammit we are supposed to downvote not to upvote idiots
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think what everyone agrees on is that if you tend to find x ethnicity attractive and rarely find y ethnicity attractive thats okay but to say something like i wouldnt date a y ethnicity is pretty fucking racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair i feel like whenever i end up reading a discussion about issues like this you see that behavior a lot from both sides one side calls the other a chauvinist or bigot and then they get called a stupid sjw or something people are very entrenched in their opinions on social issues like this and are unlikely to hear other perspectives
ShitRedditSays,removed,easily offended girls with no friends started making up genders to get attention
ShitRedditSays,removed,in blacks unlike human beings the cispeen not the brain is the seat of cognition left without empathy the black attempts to mimic sapient beings and can do so only poorly
ShitRedditSays,removed,you say that as if project management isnt a skill in and of itself
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre a man with a mental disorder
ShitRedditSays,removed,that was shitty and uncalled for however the comment it was replying to was just critiquing her work without any mention of how it was sub par work with no indication that it was because she was a woman both parties were in the wrong but the fact that the mainsplaining comment got as many downvotes as the response got upvotes is stupid both should have been downvoted
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know your using hyperbole but all this kind of thing does is incite more backlash youre not helping the cause
ShitRedditSays,removed,does it though i think thats pretty heavily debated some biased translations theres been
ShitRedditSays,removed,its probably the better alternative at least theres a chance for rational discourse if you dont go for the emotional gutshot like your op not trying to silence you or anything equality needs to be talked about and i think you should keep being outspoken i just think you should consider a more effective method to get your voice out there
ShitRedditSays,removed,not nice to call op a loser people can browse and post where they want
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think that was a joke but okay
ShitRedditSays,removed,those idiots look at them
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt hate
ShitRedditSays,removed,since when this subreddit is a feminist shithole
ShitRedditSays,removed,yep well im gay please tell me what discrimination is
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol calm your dense tits down youre acting like this sub is above any other babe
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont give a shit what color they are theyre getting run over
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wont be buying any toys anymore reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee yeah theyre totally childish
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are remakingrebooting ghostbusters with an all female main cast and reddit is pissed the trailer is currently the most disliked movie trailer on youtube and people are bitching about it constantly i would expect some negativity for a remake of a comedy classic but the detractors have really gone above and beyond and the only thing that you can really chalk it up to is misogyny the trailer with all the dislikes is not a great trailer and makes the movie look like a mediocre comedy but it is by no stretch of the imagination the worst trailer of all time the movie is getting pretty decent reviews but it looks like people are spamming imdb with one star reviews and if you go to rmovies the only reviews with any up votes are negative reviews
ShitRedditSays,removed,well yeah but in sports you dont pay to watch average joes so it normally compares athetles women player in the wnba would get dominated by most of the nba if not all
ShitRedditSays,removed,whaddup bitches thanks for reposting my factual and in no way sexist or offensive to any sane person comment here i knew when i posted it that some of you retards would get offended thanks for being so predictable anyways good luck in your continued fight against reality thanks again for the laughs diarrheaembargo out
ShitRedditSays,removed,it holds truth because it is true
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know what gap wont narrow
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not the argument though on the link they talk about two of the very best women tennis players they were young though against a man outside of the top and he won ronda rousey would kick most men asses brittney grimes would obliterate any average joe hell even most highschoolers like it wouldnt be close london olympics womens best time for is boy highschool flat the argument has always been one for one in average vs average men are normally better its not a bad thing average height and weight are smaller on women which give them a disadvantage for sports
ShitRedditSays,removed,no there is context your not getting the argument is men for the most part are better the women in sports it is not all men are better than all women noone makes that argument ever besides you now
ShitRedditSays,removed,its sarcasm yo
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a joke guys not a dick dont take it so hard
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are though
ShitRedditSays,removed,so only white people can be antisemtic
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,the problem is all these uppity nig i mean thugs reddit dot fucking com
ShitRedditSays,removed,iberians are white its just that for some redditeurs anyone who can get a tan is a filthy wog
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not literally nobody tells women that and theyre encouraged to compete in sport from a young age its not societys fault that many womens interests switch to fashion makeup and drinking once they hit their teens
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was part of an illegal baby fighting ring and i am literally shaking right now reddit is insensitive and should be burned down
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah thats how boycott is supposed to work
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is an emberassing thread for srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,obviously just an expression
ShitRedditSays,removed,ugh i wish there was a rule that you couldnt comment until at least years of agei think that would remove a lot of stupid from reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just find it hard to buy into the idea that it is a real functional choice people dont institute a policy that women need to cover their face for anything other than control over women people dont stop this kind of control without being forced to stop i dont think getting fired at the work place is going to make these women more free to show their faces but i completely understand banning them
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah but unfortunately that really isnt our place to make that choice i disagree if you live in a country you have to follow the rules of that country its not fair at all but there are going to be rules not having your face covered at all times in public is very reasonable now if this is something that youre going to choose to stay in your home and never come out over then i am right it is not a choice it is something being forced upon them i dont care what kind of group it is a government should not sit idly by and just let women get treated like second class citizens but forcing people to bend to your will because you think it will be good for them is a dangerous road that leads right to fascism thats how laws work in every nation i dont think every nation is on the road to fascism
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just dont believe you sorry i am not going to come around to agreeing that it is okay to put women as second class citizens thats what a forced face covering does
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is totally legal to walk around with a halloween mask or a ski mask this is not at all comparable to that people wear halloween costumes once a year i never see anyone wearing ski masks unless it is freezing out then that makes sense so if its about womens rights then the only correct option is to educate and provide services for those who want to change to be able to and not face too many harmful consequences so that in a a couple generations women will not be treated like second class citizens no thanks banning them from wearing a burqa isnt the answer its a great answer just get rid of the means of subjugation literally nothing bad is going to happen if women are not being forced to cover their faces they might actually enjoy being treated like human beings no laws are made because in theory they are for the betterment of the public at large well women are a part of the public protecting them from this kind of policy is a good thing i just disagree with allowing men the right to force women in their culture to wear a face covering i am never going to be okay with it i am perfectly fine with the government protecting these women from the people who want to subjugate them i guess we just wont agree on this
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes it is a thousand times better we should put a stop to the idea that women can be second class citizens
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly though it does suck
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is this on here its a classic joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,its actually pretty gun aha obviously meant in jest
ShitRedditSays,removed,we have to have laws to tell people what they cannot wear or what they have to wear i dont think people should be allowed to be nude in public and i dont think people should be allowed to go into places like a bank or a government institution with a full face mask on why is it that no matter which side youre on there are always people telling women what to wear agreed so i am going to be on the side that is not trying to force women into a faceless role in society
ShitRedditSays,removed,so if i seriously hold the religion of sith at heart its okay if i wear a darth revan mask everywhere i go and especially to work because its part of my religion youd feel totally comfortable staring at my faceless mask while i talk about the errors in your recent profit margins
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not the government restricting anything its the government giving private businesses the ability to decide who they want to hire
ShitRedditSays,removed,it could be my religion to wear batman pajamas as often as possible but i wouldnt wear them into work because its against dress code
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would indeed wearing religious iconography is a personal choice and one that can be left at home in a place of business if required by your employer otherwise you can find a job that allows it
ShitRedditSays,removed,did that trigger you
ShitRedditSays,removed,but gay menz are constantly horny and always want it up the ass amirite whats a top or a bottom
ShitRedditSays,removed,i read about this from a dark net blog warning graphic they had screen shots of a ukrainian surgeon who claimed to charge dollars for the child sex doll he would get a child surgical remove the bottom jaw and teeth remove the arms and legs then provide make a tube that runs through the stomach so he or she can be fed he said it could last for years and it would be your personal child sex doll i hope that post was a urban legend but based on what i read about the dark net it might be real
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry to queef on this circlejerk i am muslim in quotation marks because i am not sure anyone can really call themselves muslim since in the end i think thats only for the creator to decide i would argue that its an ultimate state and a high honour at most id say im a mumin and nothing more theres no doubt that legitimate cases of antiislamic fearmongering eg most examples of big media coverage of issues in the muslim world have lead to terrible things over the past few decades including unfair profiling of muslims but i want to focus on islamophobia which i interpret as the general fear of ideas and people having related to islam i think islamophobia a term meant to take advantage of antihomophobia rhetoric is perfectly justified because muslims hate airing their dirty laundry our dirtylaundry list is long very long and i think many muslims are afraid of addressing it because they think theyll end up attacking islam i think they think this way because they are far more familiar with the canonized books of hadith as it permeates our muslim life with much more ease than the quran does i wish i could convince people that examining our dirtylaundry list would end up attacking patriarchal imperialistic unquranic definitions of islam that coalesced into the orthodox over the centuries definitions of islam developed under regimes such as the umayyad caliphate not the rashidun whom the umayyads wrested power from by shedding muslim blood safavids and ottomans in the last millenium or the saudis and iranians in the last century the face veil is on the list of dirty laundry i would be totally happy with it if it was developed by muslim women for muslim women but the fact is that it was developed by muslim men for muslim women i am extremely proud of those muslim women who wear the veil and do well for themselves eg the grad student i work with but they are few and far between we both know that as muslims most women have to wear the veil because of cultural pressure from their family not because they really want to so no dont defend it and as long as we continue doing unquranic stuff lets not be surprised if we see the following people have been acting increasingly verbally as well as physically violent towards me and other friends of mine who are muslim i am genuinely worried about the future
ShitRedditSays,removed,that comment isnt that bad the post on the other hand
ShitRedditSays,removed,bonus hes also a chaser
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah bill clinton did it
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh noooo normal relationships are so offensive must conform to the sjw approved race mixing quota to be progressive
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats so offensive about this what he said is pretty much true
ShitRedditSays,removed,well the linked post itself didnt even mention interracial dating
ShitRedditSays,removed,meh even when talking about interracial dating when it comes to asians you cant deny that a lot of it is the product of the negative portrayal of asian guys in the west
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do you care
ShitRedditSays,removed,nothing wrong with that they just wont be a part of asian civilization anymore eurasian sure like kazakhstan or something but not asian by definition
ShitRedditSays,removed,and like rshitredditsays is about feminism
ShitRedditSays,removed,because redditers cant help but make fun of trans people narcissists and their intellectually bankrupt sjw useful idiot supporters at every opportunity ftfy
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you guys ever think maybe you are taking some of these comments too seriously
ShitRedditSays,removed,good luck trying to offend trolls lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,this asian civilization deserves to die maybe it does but not before europe devolves into islamafricanistan and murica breaks apart into a safricabrazil like balkanized mess lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,no actually its white men who think they own asian females and they are right of teenearly gen asian females in murica default to white guys as their natural partner the epidemic of asian females prefereing white guys over asian guys is so prevalent dat on the rare case that an asian girl tells a white guy that she prefers an asian guy dat white guys feel entitled to asian girls and when rejected their racism reveals itself just bc a white guy is willing to fuck u doesnt mean dat he aint racist towards u also tons of white guys think they own white women too httpnextsharkcomracistwhiteguygoesberserkgermangirlwontleaveasianbf
ShitRedditSays,removed,come on i was trolling at whitebeauty i posted a photo of a jewish woman they dont know yet
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey asians maybe black people dont like you because you are shooting them for no reason
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand how sjws can laugh at a woman cutting off her husbands dick and throwing it into a garbage disposal youre literally just mirroring what the other side thinks
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one in this sub talks about how racist and sexist the left can be sometimes but always rats on the right talk about hypocrisy not to mention this sub is just one giant circle jerk and echo chamber
ShitRedditSays,removed,ben yeah dont ben me please anyways you getting mods to ban me because i posted in mgtow thats funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,another thing is in mgtow you can make a post promoting the left but here if you even make a negative comment about the left you get banned
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean like mlk
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you seen this subreddit you are doing the exact same thing in almost every comment thread here there is at least one person calling out whiteys trying to be an advocate for antiracism cant be done if you are also racist thats not how that works
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fucking fuck did you just shitpost about me you sizechallenged neckbeard ill have you know i graduated in the middle of my class in womyns studies and ive been involved in numerous secret downvote brigades on radviceanimals and i have over confirmed bens i am trained in looking like a gorilla and im the top commenter in the entire feminist blogosphere you are nothing to me but just another target i will gripe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen upon this earth you mark my words you think you can get away with posting that funny shit to me over the internet think again privileged little penis as we speak i am contacting my vast network of legbeards across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better get ready for the jerk shitlord the jerk that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead sawcasm i can be anywhere anytime and i can ben you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare dildz not only am i extensively trained in feminism but i have access to the entire arsenal of the department of gender studies and i will use it to its full extent to wall of text your miserable ass off the face of the fempire you little shitlord if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little edgy comment was about to bring upon you maybe you would have checked your fucking privilege but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price cis scum i will loose the fury of my lunar flow all over you and you will drown in it what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little shitlord ill have you know i graduated top of my class in womens studies and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on rseduction and i have over confirmed bens i am trained in vote brigading and im the top archangelle in the entire fempire you are nothing to me but just another bigot i will ben you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over reddit think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of gynquisitors across the fempire and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that bens the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking benned kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can ben you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in moderation but i have access to the entire dildz arsenal of the fempire and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shitlord if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little shitty comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn sawcsm i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking benned shitlord
ShitRedditSays,removed,the wage gap is a myth though
ShitRedditSays,removed,except there is debate and there is definitive proof it is a myth
ShitRedditSays,removed,do u wanna meet ben
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a le women so its less bad amirite
ShitRedditSays,removed,this gets posted every thread but we made it so its le funny xd
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats what rape is for
ShitRedditSays,removed,obligatory calmdown
ShitRedditSays,removed,what are your preferred pronouns
ShitRedditSays,removed,nobody here is defending cp we all recognize it is wrong its more that they dont feel the proper response is being enacted the punishment must fit the crime whatever your views on that may be no beheadings for petty theft and no wristslapping for genocide
ShitRedditSays,removed,the ones severely oppressed and ostracised by their own communities those ones theyre a thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,how can they not see that looking at pics of child porn is just as bad as molesting a child by that logic anyone who has viewed rwatchpeopledie is also guilty of perpetrating murder and suicide which make up most of that subs content i get that viewing cp is bad a crime etc but your logic as to why is wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,its funny for one
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you actually take this from another persons posts and repost it here dude pathetic
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahahahahaha so you have a sub full of pathetic idiots like you as well are you guys just naturally born this stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,makes sense to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,and
ShitRedditSays,removed,id say the raping kids is worse because theres rapebut no excuse for the cp either both are bad but rape is worse
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh you mean the production of the child pornography yeah that has the rape in it too so its at least as bad if not eeking out a little worse because its rapeforprofit
ShitRedditSays,removed,right better get an office token who is just there for employee diversity
ShitRedditSays,removed,and still funny every time
ShitRedditSays,removed,the reply literally said they can be offended if they want just that posting that wont do anything about it freedom of speech doesnt mean you cant get downvoted to oblivion for saying something people dont agree with
ShitRedditSays,removed,the thread seems to be more prointersectionalism than antifeminism but maybe im just looking at it through rose colored glasses
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah it couldnt possibly be her fault the alcohol bottles in the car are irrelevant they were probably placed there by someone else too
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just saying theres no objectification in simply noticing something sexy about another human its perfectly fine for you to notice the same in a man or woman so the ass was fat comment really shouldnt be what you complain aboutmore the rape and other stuff
ShitRedditSays,removed,stalker much oh wait this is srs im not surprised
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,didnt even need to scroll through your comment history bruh justified you always gotta see where someone else stands before making an opinion of your own clearly im working against the fempire so everything i say can easily be written off using out of context quotes
ShitRedditSays,removed,the circlequeef part surely that doesnt mean youd let each other go as far as condemning human sexuality would it seems extreme to have no disagreements ever
ShitRedditSays,removed,clearly its not meant to be funny its just a beautiful image for people to take a break and admire i posted it so many times so that itd be more likely to get noticed you guys need to mix things up a little bit around here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet you consider other peoples opinions in real life to be just points too
ShitRedditSays,removed,comment obsessing right im obsessing anymore out of context quotes for me
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you implying that line cutters are always women
ShitRedditSays,removed,hows your marriage working out then
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit this is hilarious saving this image
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ youre judgmental but hey i guess thats probably why youre on srs making fun of normal people
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah its pretty funny when people say things that obviously arent true
ShitRedditSays,removed,actual science is a biotroof and banned from this forum the only science that reals is the science of womens feels
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought this subreddit was satire nope a bunch of folks with their panties in knots ban me please this shit is disgusting
ShitRedditSays,removed,still fuck hillary clinton
ShitRedditSays,removed,but isnt it illegal to pay women less for the same work
ShitRedditSays,removed,ehh hehe heh yeah you do that sweetbottom thats just what the liberals need to get elected a repeat of at the dnc
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a dumb stupid bitch cant go two seconds without opening her whore mouth why cant we criticize women without being labeled as sexist
ShitRedditSays,removed,loooool those were funny comments
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you good sirmaamxirxam
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you still think it happens i guess it does i dont know why else the gap could exist even when controlling for other factors it just seems hard to believe that so many companies are breaking the law but there is no public outrage about it if a woman who got paid less for the same work told the media about it i imagine it would be a huge news story so i wonder why that isnt happening
ShitRedditSays,removed,why not give some dosh to those families so that they can live more comfortably ooooh yes because that means that youll have less toffs should be ground into dogfood
ShitRedditSays,removed,i guess youre right i just thought that it would have come to someones attention during all this time like through some coworkers discussing their salaries for example i would think that is likely considering that this has apparently been happening for decades to millions of workers by the way if we know based on the statistics that companies pay women less for the same work i wonder why the government is not doing investigations to see which companies are breaking the law if we know for a fact that many of them are doing it
ShitRedditSays,removed,when has an influx of nonwhites ever improved an area
ShitRedditSays,removed,😅
ShitRedditSays,removed,k
ShitRedditSays,removed,til reddit is one person
ShitRedditSays,removed,but its only a real joke if men die duh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i suspect they might be making a light hearted joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,am i an idiot trying to handwave people who dont look like mes oppression yes do i have a fucking clue what im talking about no am i probably a white male typing this yes do i live in my mothers basement yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,and whats a black employer dumping a resume just cause the name sounds white or treating white staff like shit just cause theyre white
ShitRedditSays,removed,guys read the whole comment this is taken totally out of context
ShitRedditSays,removed,modern spin on a classic
ShitRedditSays,removed,preach it
ShitRedditSays,removed,why
ShitRedditSays,removed,saudi women and others promoting a petition online asking for some basic human rights for themselves are racist shitstains wow
ShitRedditSays,removed,its funnier every time
ShitRedditSays,removed,the same joke but with a twist its sofunny
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont forget the lusitania
ShitRedditSays,removed,has anyone ever actually been upset about white male jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont get offended by any jokes about privilege just as others shouldnt give a shit about the jokes said about themselves its all very childish and this generation needs to grow up
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha youre adorable sweetheart
ShitRedditSays,removed,aww look at you trying to be edgy
ShitRedditSays,removed,not everyone browses
ShitRedditSays,removed,by that logic we should all be afraid of black people since they commit a disproportionate amount of crime
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,well to be fair most people caught arent getting just months if that was the norm everyone would be raping
ShitRedditSays,removed,corrected for accuracy hateful protester accidentally brushed her own breast against the arm of a trump supporter inappropriately and unforgivably attacked him violently and got sprayed in selfdefense ftfy
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt gender fluid basically acting out stereotypes that surround both genders
ShitRedditSays,removed,key word is jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,sits at
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,mugabe smash
ShitRedditSays,removed,nonwhite genocide
ShitRedditSays,removed,i forgot la raza did nothing wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes we must silence these fools once we have taken the rights of the despicable rascist whites we can be rid of them
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly the linked post isnt nearly as bad as i expected it to be the comments replying to it are utter shit but the op seems to be coming from a place of genuine if misguided concern its a step up from the asshattery ive come to expect from reddit on trans issues
ShitRedditSays,removed,hmm fair enough i didnt read any hate in the post but rather an overprotective parent trying to keep his child from that which he doesnt understand as you said though different perspectives and i can see where youre coming from
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre pretty narrow minded then
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you are fighting yourself ironic really considering every single one of you pieces of trash envision the very definition of fascism
ShitRedditSays,removed,look lies no way liberal retards lying
ShitRedditSays,removed,well its really more like hitting a drunk guy who jumped in front of your car or asked you to hit them
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the only somewhat logical way to think about this is when one person is drunk and conscious consents to sex and gets the police involved
ShitRedditSays,removed,drunk people try to have sex with each other the only debatable thing here is when does an intoxicated person lose the ability to consent to sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah thats still a bad example i cant really think of an analogy that doesnt involve something directly related to sex or stuff or like that though how about this its like a person asked you to spray some of your cologne or perfume on them theyre drunk they get up the next morning and are upset that they have it on them quite reasonably
ShitRedditSays,removed,but in the moment it is not rape the person is there and happily participating in the event whether or not they later regret and have serious issues with it also im not talking about people who are black out drunk and are convinced to have sex im talking about normal drunk sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,im talking about someone who wakes up the next day and regrets the action not someone who doesnt remember it taking place
ShitRedditSays,removed,dafuq is srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes i think thats what the post is saying
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont you have the slightest sense of humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,can people not joke about anything tragic comedians make a living of it people use it to cope it doesnt detract from the situation it was just a funny quip
ShitRedditSays,removed,believe it or not some people possess something called a sense of humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,heh
ShitRedditSays,removed,well theyre right
ShitRedditSays,removed,every man
ShitRedditSays,removed,beating a disabled horse
ShitRedditSays,removed,and yet here you stand with that flair
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre retarded you landwhale go fuck yourself with a fire extinguisher
ShitRedditSays,removed,what are you denying that trumps protestors arent illustrating why he is winning people see thugs attack american citizens exercising their amendment police do nothing if you knew anything about americans you would know they hate to see people who are above the law that is why trump is gaining support and that is why he will win no matter how much whining you do about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,keep telling yourself that buddy
ShitRedditSays,removed,telling a racist joke doesnt necessarily make you racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes but theres also people who arent participants in these conflicts they see somebody say all lives matter and theyre like well duh and never think about it beyond that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree with you on your second point but how is this making fun of disabled people he made a joke saying he enjoys porn of disabled people i dont see how thats making fun of them
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is sexist
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is so weird they are not wrong better treatment for pedophiles and better routes for nonoffending pedophiles to seek treatment would be likely to decrease harm against children and would be likely to be a productive approach to take but every time they say it i get the feeling theyre more interested in this idea because its nicer for pedophiles not because its safer for children
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you sure theyre talking about the victim being drunk here and not the perpetrator it sounds a lot like he could be saying that alcohol is never an excuse to rape someone just like being drunk could never be an excuse for crashing a car this would make sense because the judge considered the rapists intoxication as a mitigating factor part of his fucked up reasoning for reducing the sentence the comment is quite ambiguous so it could either be that this is a daft twat saying the victim is at fault because she was drunk or theyre making the very good point that the judge is retarded for considering intoxication to be a mitigating factor in this case
ShitRedditSays,removed,then leave theres nothing really keeping you here
ShitRedditSays,removed,im white and i think this is pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i mean theres not exactly a rule in the sidebar saying you cant make stale jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt say it was valuable but theres also really no rules against contributing silly stuff its usually called shitposting id prolly go so far as to say almost nothing on reddit is valuable its just a silly little site
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true friends dont let friends fuck white men
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dunno if its quite that there are a fair amount of progressive commenters there many who are very up front about it if the topic comes up but i think theres also a lot of people who just go for a goofy indulgence in reddit drama and then some jokes in the comment section i dont think most of them are spending too long dissecting how the joke plays into existing power structures
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean certainly never the real thing but just like antiwhite stuff or joking about severe depression or a host of other things that are really serious in real life a lot of people get a laugh out of just trivializing them and making jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one questions that the hero the shining beacon of all that is good and right is always a white guy what a load of shit morpheus john shaft ellis red redding emil foley mammy john hancock mouse alexander idi amin dada sheriff bart malcolm x ezekial rawlins john coffey jules winnfield blade roger murtaugh agent jay storm ba baracus del spooner john wraith steve montogmery darwin frozone luther i mean the list can go on get over yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,lolololol kill yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you retarded most first world countries actually punish rapists and not the victims
ShitRedditSays,removed,and thats why youre an asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,bernie sanders really isnt a progrssive hes a reactionary populist on economic issues and oldschool liberal on social issues his antiimmigration and antifed rhetoric is painfully bad banking industry executives must no longer be allowed to serve on the feds boards and to handpick its members and staff board positions should instead include representatives from all walks of life — including labor consumers homeowners urban residents farmers and small businesses though i obviously think bernie is better than trump this might be dumber than any single thing trump has said this cycle it might be dumber than that senator saying the female body can shut down its reproductive system in case of rape all in all though i much much prefer bernies domestic and foreign policy to hillarys im glad shes the nominee bernie just has no fucking clue on some economic issues and i dont think hell be open to listening
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes an economic reactionary he opposes any movement towards free trade which includes open immigration policy im hardly what you would call a leftist and im more of an altfeminist id say libertarian feminist but christina hoff sommers hijacked that term despite being neither a feminist or libertarian im just calling bernie what he is
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet youre white or do you not self identify as white
ShitRedditSays,removed,a lot of you all mistake what a few rich elite snobs did for the deeds of all white people thats my biggest issue with you all you attack white people instead of the rich snobs who are working to ruin the lives of the everyday person in order to safeguard their wealth the majority of white people just want to live their lives
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,regardless of your perceptions statistic do not lie id like to point out that the poverty rate started dropping insanely fast in i wonder what ideology collapsed around that time
ShitRedditSays,removed,ahh yes a response as expected no substance to argument instead you have to resort to cursing and internet language im a feminist that being said i hate all these tumblr feminist who make modern day feminism a joke instead of educating themselves on the problems of the world modern day wage slavery in the near east the frequent plundering of the democratic republic of congo turkeys descent into a dictatoral state americas rising wage gap ect they just follow whatever their tumblr friends will tell them and instead of focusing on actual issues you all continue to attack minute issues and some nonissues like demanding more homosexual relationships in movies that is for the writers to decide not you thank you all for ruining a beautiful movement ban me i dont care just wanted to vent on how this skewed tumblr version of feminism is a joke and is being treated as such by the general public
ShitRedditSays,removed,or you can take the stick out of your arse
ShitRedditSays,removed,that doesnt say anything about hurting mexico the argument was that nafta did not return mexico to growth rates that ignores the fact that the growth in the was caused by an oil boom oil booms dont last forever
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a dirty neoliberal scum feminist sue me my bookshelf is full of milton friedman books
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys just sit here raging at jokes made on reddit that doesnt sound very fun or healthy i guess its better than just feeling powerless and frustrated that its only in this subreddit you can enforce your view of free speech which is really just selective censorship
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill bite im one of the pedophile defenders genuinely serious i stick up for them whenever i can and id be happy to explain my rationale if you have any questions but really its a shame that someone actively participating remotely in child rape is punished similarly to one participating in person thats the injustice this is the kind of statement that bothers me maybe i misunderstood this but it seemed like this was your summation of the phrase its a shame that in the us nonoffending pedophiles are treated with the same scorn as child molesters meaning that youre saying that if youre a pedophile you must have indulged in some form of child pornmolestation unless i misunderstood your argument i believe youve drawn a false equivalence here i defend nonoffending pedophiles only people that are sexually attracted to children but have not taken any steps to satisfy their urges if youve touched a kid or looked at child porn i have no defense or pity for you the only people that i defend are people that have never participated in child rape remotely or directly i think its telling that often people can only argue against the pedophile defense by ignoring the possibility of a pedophile wanting to or being successful in suppressing their urges a large part of the argument is drawing the distinction between child molester and pedophile its an integral part of our argument and by ignoring that distinction youre no longer debating my argument but some straw man that youve built and news fucking flash saying im horny and wanted to doesnt actually make whatever you do ok i absolutely agree and pretty much everyone ive seen that agrees with me would also agree with this there is no excuse for indulging in those urges no matter how hard your struggle has been no one is trying to defend anyone that has done something i acknowledge that there is a very small minority of people that honestly do show sympathy for actual offenders legitimate molesters i think a large portion of these people are trolls at least on reddit that people take seriously when they say stuff thats obviously ridiculous ive seen comments that were obviously sarcasticly supporting child molesters to make the argument seem ridiculous get downvoted to hell and the poster harassed until they add that s but im willing to concede that there is a small group that defend child molesters and i think those few people get conflated with people that honestly like me that just want to get help for pedophiles to keep them from becoming molesters lastly i just want to say that i am preaching about sympathy towards these people my main goal is to help stop molestation before it begins my main concern isnt the pedophiles its the kids
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is my minutes in fame
ShitRedditSays,removed,do yall enjoy being miserable all the time this movie is aimed squarely at people like you
ShitRedditSays,removed,yup wish id thought to screencap all of that shit to wave in tias face next time they try to argue with me about literally anything but the thread is still up as are pretty much all of the commnets just go screencap it it would be nicer if reddit would give you a whole view of the thread for the sake of the screencaps having to press continue this thread buttons and screencapping separate pages is a bit annoying also i recommend you use firefox inbuilt screenshot feature you can get a shell with and then just type screenshot fullpage filenamepng
ShitRedditSays,removed,he aint wrong niggers gonna nig
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt this the show where he fanbase bullied an artist to a suicide attempt because she drew some of the characters as slimmer than they appear on the show thats all ive ever heard about this show so i chose not to check it out as that seemed like a very toxic fanbase also i cant understand how someone can defend blackface by saying its not an issue in their culturelol what
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe i misunderstand the nuance of punch down but would bill hicks be an example of punching down im thinking specifically of his bit where hes in a southern diner reading and the server asks whatchu readin for which i found hilarious or is that phrase for something more specific like haha minorities do stereotypical stuff haha
ShitRedditSays,removed,well not just him but too braces for ban for interrupting the circlequeef
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive always wondered what shitredditsays is now i know its just an sjw circlejerk cesspool thanks for the quick intro guys
ShitRedditSays,removed,clearly got swerved by a lady boy in the streets of thailand
ShitRedditSays,removed,the full comment sheds light on the commenters mentality this is one extreme case they present dad ran over his own daughter felt guilty committed suicide and the commenter doesnt see the point in everyone across a country having to get a fancy rearview camera
ShitRedditSays,removed,man woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,read the post history in this sub and other is not joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,im discussing this user specifically
ShitRedditSays,removed,really like i get the bullshit but all white guys wow
ShitRedditSays,removed,these social injustice warriors have become even more annoying than the people theyre always whining about they have become what they hate just on the other side of the coin
ShitRedditSays,removed,cool ive been following this srs since sa i dont support trump at all i dont generalize by race im doing my best to get everyone i know to vote against him i already voted against him so are all the white dudes i hang out with you want to insult me ok so im only good because i dont rape and i am not racist im shit and im a fragile snowflake because i call you out on your bullshit and all this because of how i was born does that sound ok to you really so what is your solution exactly maybe kill all of us how the fuck do you not see you have decided to be what you hate
ShitRedditSays,removed,my fragility what would you do if i called everyone who looked like you shit would you just be happy with it im not and i stand up against it this is your example of fragility someone who stands up to you nice
ShitRedditSays,removed,how could you define what sex is because of their mental health issues being taken advantage of and which is not like if somebody is autistic can they not have sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,a therapist
ShitRedditSays,removed,forcibly silencing certain viewpoints only lends them credibility at least in modern america reactionary movements are fueled in part by the selfrighteous fury of rightwingers who feel they are being silenced one reason trump is so popular is because hes given a voice to rightwingers who feel like theyve been shut down by political correctness
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit this is the most harmless joke ever lighten up and lets focus on actually comments that are actuality shit like the loads of endless racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,downvote me to hell but i dont think that a positive comparison of any group to american evangelicals is much of a recommendation present day islam has an embarrassing litany of serious problems to deal with and they are not being called out on this enough but evangelical christianity in the us is fast becoming a genuine existential threat to civilization in any meaningful sense of that term
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a black man
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi id be grateful if you read me whole response its a long and im sorry about that i dont know how to be more succinct to start off with no im not shitting you it seems to me that theres a difference between making unfounded accusations and criticizing real problems most of what is occurring among the altright which is who i assume youre alluding to seems to be of the former sort assuming that a persons being muslims means that there might be good reason to assume they are probably a terrorist a sharia apologist or something comparably conspiratorial for example this is obviously an irrational and dangerous substitute for thought and youre right that it is the dominant kind of rhetoric coming from trump and his merry gang of miscreants but islams puritanical tendencies that you alluded to in the first sentence of your edit are quite pronounced and they are not being addressed consistently or clearly as far as i can see maybe ive missed something and i mean that sincerely but for example when i see my own selfproclaimed feminist head of state addressing a gender segregated mosque with nothing but a simper a part of me wonders why we are showing special privilege to this community i mean this particular mosque in this case i know for a fact that christian communities have been called out quite directly on comparable regressive practices and rightly so it would have been a scandal if they had not been so when i say that islams problems arent being called out enough i mean that people are not identifying these manifest unjust practices and expressing opposition to it in a way that is analytic and helpful i know that this is not the norm but i do think its the case that in university settings there is a pronounced tendency to refuse to distinguish between the thought and the thinker and both self proclaimed conservatives and liberals engage in this kind of identity politics in their own way and for their own ends and this makes it difficult in these contexts in universities to speak criticize an idea without it being perceived as an attack on the person who holds that idea and by extension their community this is all the more tragic because the first people to suffer from the perpetuation of many of these problems as you put it are the minorities within the muslim community i agree with you that trumps registry is a hugely worrying idea but there are already women in communities probably very close to you who are living in a kind of neurotic haze taught to think of themselves as sexual objects to obsess over their fathers notions of purity and either internalizing these oppressions or living in constant anxiety because of their private disagreement or reservations and their inability to express this note im of course not claiming that this is universally true we shouldnt be surprised by this every form of christianity has produced the same or similar effects on its adherents especially women this is a known and pretty well understood phenomena i dont know why you felt the need to lecture me about christianity at the end i already told you that i believe evangelical christianity in the us poses an existential threat how direct can i be your hypothetical about the wbc is oddly far fetched there is already a christian theocrat in the penultimate office of the most powerful nation on earth for fucks sake the whole gop is enthralled to a disgusting form of christianity that is reactionary flagrantly puritanical and ludicrously antiintellectual and it is celebrated for being these very things by its advocates you dont need the wbc youre already there but the difference is that the gop is castigated mercilessly everywhere outside of the foxsphere everyone from oliver to maher happily pisses on the insanity of the gop although more people need to follow bill in openly drawing attention to the role christianity plays in informing and enabling these kinds of beliefs and behaviors tldr christianity is a problem that is openly discussed when you arent watching fox islam much less so and when it is the people that do the talking seem to be the belligerent xenophobes who would rather implement a muslim registry than tell mosques that segregation and compelling your daughters to veil themselves are not okay in a tolerant culture that advocates personal autonomy and the equality of persons id appreciate it if you could be less rude in your future responses i apologize for the ambiguity in my first response and i hope this makes things clearer id like to hear your response ifwhen you care to right it
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay but if companies could pay women less wouldnt their be much much more women in the workforce
ShitRedditSays,removed,im actually curious but will probably get downvoted anyway how exactly does the wage gap affect you
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahha are you guys upset over someones clothing maybe you should write laws on what people are allowed and not allowed to wear xd
ShitRedditSays,removed,completely agree if you look at any surveys of muslims from the western world a large majority of them have incompatible views from western liberalismleftism
ShitRedditSays,removed,its sad but true rnews mods have had a track record of censoring news or islamic terror
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure these unfuckable hate nerds would have plenty of sympathy if he was a year old straight white guy that felt threatened by feminist womz and other spooky minorities
ShitRedditSays,removed,then theres a comment by emmastonelisps that carries a similar message i dont disagree with the downvoting but im just wondering why one opinion is so popular and a similar one is downvoted
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah we do great point by him glad this sub shared this so we can all healp
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i really hope people who disagree with me get banned and i never have to listen to opinions i dont like again they are literal nazis someone got the polite hitler comic handy
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ indian misogyny and rape culture is pretty damn high isnt it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i genuinly dont understand why the left thinks trying to equate a single bombing of an abortion clinic bombing that happened years ago with the treatment of women homosexuals free thinkers and public intellectuals in the muslim world today is some kind of solid argument
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought this sub doesnt find pedophilia to be bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,im scared of keeping rthedonald around because its a breeding place for poop however shutting it down may cause the poop to spread over everything quickly im scared of either one
ShitRedditSays,removed,its good for the young reddit leftists to be exposed to different ideas when they grow up and join adulthood the real world hits them like a ton of bricks my observations leave me troubled by how poorly they are handling this transition life is more than liberal echo chambers and dog pictures
ShitRedditSays,removed,going from safe spaces with playdoh and emotional support dogs to working a job where they dont tolerate such reaction to challenges criticisms and diversity ive noticed young people tend to shut down when faced with these obstacles and they dont know a healthy was to react and overcome also your boss and hr wont react to kindly to your discussing politics around the office or even on social media it should be kept to yourself and your private circles
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty sure he was mocking the first person
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a tie for with rpolitics and ratheism
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know this is a really old joke that doesnt actually express racist views right
ShitRedditSays,removed,minorities already have the same rights they want some imaginary privilege that they think white people have
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpswwwredditcomrsuckituppussy some cry baby reactionary made this sub take it over
ShitRedditSays,removed,their advertisers dont want to be associated with the quarantined subs and their content to avoid losing them as advertisers they just dont show them honestly the revenue lost on so few subreddits would be negligible compared to losing even one site wide it has nothing to do with the admins being racist so take off your tin foil hat
ShitRedditSays,removed,i gotcha he didnt actually say it while were on the topic i really dont like the defense of ygs video particularly given whats been happening recently what are your thoughts
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you are dedicated to this model minority shit huh
ShitRedditSays,removed,the full quote is dude if im a chinkwhat are you in response to being called a racial slur by someone who should know better nice editorializing troll
ShitRedditSays,removed,i guess youre into shitposting ive never seen vorpaleskimo post a single worthwhile thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,the dsm disagrees and you have no idea wtf you are talking about it is perfectly normal and healthy to be sexual attracted to postpubescent members of your species which pedophiles arent btw they are attracted to prepubescents by their very definition that is how our genes direct us sex with postpubescent individuals is purely a arbitrary legislative limit like the age of majority set to establish at which point that person has moral agency to engage in that behavior its why the age of consent varies from to all over the world just like the drinking age child support age voting age etc but you will find nowhere well maybe some shithole like somalia where laws dont exist where pederasty which is what you are really talking about here since you dont seem to know what a pedophile is is legal because its a universal norm natural law that sex with prepubescents is wrong just like incest murder rape and theft is universally illegal or condemned even in failed nations and under anarchist conditions
ShitRedditSays,removed,that doesnt mean that they dont deserve to feel the negative consequences of being imperialists the idea that they cant sustain the refugee population is absolute bullshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a bit from its always sunny in philadelphia
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats your bean situation
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt this a quote from a movie
ShitRedditSays,removed,man the underscore me irl has been on a roll lately what is it about that sub that attracts more degenerates
ShitRedditSays,removed,if i get banned from here does this sub stop showing up on rall or how does it work can you please ban me i dont like it here thanks in advance
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey srs we have a long standing tradition of making circlejerk threads with copypastas translated to hebrew in them i only chose this one because it plays along nicely in hebrew
ShitRedditSays,removed,israel is actually a very good place for gays in the middle east
ShitRedditSays,removed,like i said sounds good in hebrew nobody actually listens to what copypastas say you could say that the us marine belittles soldiers but it shouldnt really offend someone because it is clearly trolling and the author doesnt mean the things that are written in the copypasta the original meaning is lost out due to how i translated it anyway
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean it is not perfect but we are moving in the right direction
ShitRedditSays,removed,horsehock theory never heard that term google wasnt much help
ShitRedditSays,removed,just did man
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah like you
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not sure why i got banned for commenting is she hot lol im
ShitRedditSays,removed,k
ShitRedditSays,removed,context man posts that he had sex with his wife last night even though he didnt to and that he was okay with it on top of which they have a mutual prearranged consent in place
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am a heterosexual woman and i cannot stop staring at this womans lovely breasts long enough to see the actual trick from another comment in that thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,yay i made it
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahahaha you are an idiot even snopes will tell you otherwise
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are you pretending this is something only conservatives do i had to watch democrats deny facts and deflect questions the entire election its not party exclusive
ShitRedditSays,removed,funny ive read every single comment here and not a single one of you lunatics managed to provide the quoteproof that trump opposes the transsexuals you bash someone for claiming it doesnt exist while at the same time refusing to provide any evidence if does
ShitRedditSays,removed,this post is pretty legitimate imo but i guess its easier to mock than it is to make a genuine attempt at selfreflection
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get what youre going for and agree but id hardly call a woman a minority
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does it feel hes elected
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wonder how does a gay reconcile islams condemnation of homosexuality christians for that matter too
ShitRedditSays,removed,well did he i couldnt find it on this or that thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol like its an aa meeting
ShitRedditSays,removed,trigger me timbers
ShitRedditSays,removed,he has never said that he is blatantly anti homosexuality but he has never spoken in support of conversion therapy that misconception comes from a tenuously linked quote
ShitRedditSays,removed,implying that someone possesses negative personality traits based on their race is called racism friend
ShitRedditSays,removed,you moderators here sometimes have a really strange interpretation of how rules and guidelines are supposed to work your top post from the last ages is a moderator shitpost are you guys okay
ShitRedditSays,removed,logical fallacy alert
ShitRedditSays,removed,none of that is what i was commenting on though youre literally deflecting when my post was about how both sides deflect facts and questions
ShitRedditSays,removed,huehuehuehuehueh get it its a cum joke hurrrrrrrrrrrrrrr man shut up that wasnt even funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,muh triggerd rawr xd
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand this at all i was in the army we had openly gay people in my company we didnt care because we just viewed them as fellow soldiers maybe since we were a medical company we were more open idk to the majority of us a veteran is a veteran we were all on the second team
ShitRedditSays,removed,imo this is okay obviously its not the cleverest joke to ever exist but i dont really see an argument for it being bigoted in any way
ShitRedditSays,removed,but clinton was also mentored in her own words by an actual kkk leader
ShitRedditSays,removed,closing avenues of speech and debate is pretty though fine with calling them whatever but actively stopping the discussion of any topic in a university or place of higher learning is dangerous it should be possible to have a reasoned argument about the most uncomfortable of topics without silencing anyones voice
ShitRedditSays,removed,since they are such open and shut arguments why not allow them to be debated freely
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre actually a fucking moron
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair most experts on fascism agree trump is not a fascist why use a term that is debatable when there are plenty of legitimate ways to describe him sexist capitalist racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,google is trump a fascist and youll see although i use most rather generously based on what ive read theres a majority but not a consensus at any rate trump might lead to fascism and have many elements of fascism but were still a ways from it
ShitRedditSays,removed,women are a minority
ShitRedditSays,removed,unfriend them and let them know why show them youre above such petty divisions and that theyre racist scum
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean years
ShitRedditSays,removed,nonviolently lynch black people i guess s
ShitRedditSays,removed,who is they
ShitRedditSays,removed,this entire thread is fucking garbage i couldnt find any nontotallyshitty comment that wasnt downvoted is this sub this awful
ShitRedditSays,removed,liberalsminorities use them as a tool to attack white people i have noticed this for a while
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get where you are coming for and in your situation its completly rational to be against it of course it can be used to groom children and i am very sorry that something like that happened to you but i dont think there is a way to forbid simulated childrens pornography shitty disgusting himan beings exist shitty disgusting tase in porn exists that said i dont think that what happened to you could have been prevented if loli was not legal the person that groomed you would have found another way another excuse i really dont want you to think i want to invalidate your expierence or oppinion on and talking out of my ass about a subject you are clearly more attached to
ShitRedditSays,removed,well cutting off a dudes dick or a gals breast would be pretty close though you might have trouble defending that tactic
ShitRedditSays,removed,he should get promoted its good to here that teachers are spreading ideas of political tolerance
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would you even be watching south park its racist and racism is systemic like crime and crime is for minorities
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre truly enlightened people who believe in social darwinism so subhumans and fatties get flushed out quite fast
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol hes asian you racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive yet to find someone who hasnt had their arms cut off who truly understands what it feels like to have their arms cut off no matter how you try to explain it they just dont get it
ShitRedditSays,removed,native americans sought guns from the imperial colonizers to better slaughter other natives and take over their land but thats none of my business
ShitRedditSays,removed,until men are given the same opportunities as women we require job hiring quotas female candidates are now twice as likely to be chosen as equally qualified men
ShitRedditSays,removed,only idiots get their political ideas from cartoons like south park and stevens universe
ShitRedditSays,removed,or the blogs of angry suburban white liberal teenagers
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,fatpeoplehate is leaking dont fat shame people
ShitRedditSays,removed,therefor we must change our laws that prohibit discrimination to systemically discriminate against whites and men
ShitRedditSays,removed,my post
ShitRedditSays,removed,i do think the original joke is kind of funny at least its acknowledging a wage gap
ShitRedditSays,removed,hate to point this out but youre a redditor too
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know what they say the only good pedo
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah come on man one is doing an action and the other is the recording of someone else doing the same action its completely not the same thing jeez
ShitRedditSays,removed,fun fact youre a redditor
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres some trolling involved but id say im mostly sincere i really despise clinton and democrats and i think that the orange nazi is making yall forget that clinton is also a nazi and that she is going to betray everything you believe in once she has power
ShitRedditSays,removed,weve recognized the pattern for for quite some time now times change but some things are constant
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a socialist did the one million times i unironically typed amerikkka here not give it away
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi im a young white male im not a racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,so what your saying is this sub doesnt down vote brigade
ShitRedditSays,removed,the way reddit talks about pedophilia as if its a legitimate sexual orientation is breathtaking
ShitRedditSays,removed,that doesnt make any sense op wasnt talking about any of those things literally strawman no one talking about transition or bathrooms they talking about being tricked into having sex this happens all of the time
ShitRedditSays,removed,no its still a strawman
ShitRedditSays,removed,context person tricked another into having sex and got stabbed to death dont trick people into having sex dont get stabbed this makes total sense its a bummer but we
ShitRedditSays,removed,and if a white male tricks said people into having sex said persons might stab him
ShitRedditSays,removed,trans women arent actually women we just say they are to be nice they still dudes
ShitRedditSays,removed,asians are one of the smallest ethnic groups in us and make up for half of phds this just numbers
ShitRedditSays,removed,no people should take they bodies this aint a game aint no respawns and shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats completely accurate pepe just became a nazi recently
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a a muslim this is hilarious
ShitRedditSays,removed,yea violence against women gays trans and children is actually a serious issue for my peopel this aint racist just true
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah how dare they celebrate their religion
ShitRedditSays,removed,all right now youre being unfair everything he said is true we need to make it easier for people to seek help of they realise their attractions so that we as a society can support them in not offending id wager there already are a good number of not offending pedophiles out there no one is saying that this is an attraction that should be acted on ive read an ama on the german version of that subreddit recently the guy is young fully aware that his urges are not to be acted upon and he is seeking help which is how it should be if we make it harder for pedophiles to seek support we do the opposite of what we are trying to achieve fewer cases of child molestation
ShitRedditSays,removed,kill your masters kill your masters kill your masters
ShitRedditSays,removed,the context is about high school seniors dating freshmen
ShitRedditSays,removed,like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know any sort of pedophile apologia isnt cool here but i just gotta ask something does srs generally think theres a distinction worth making between those who have pedophilic attractionsphrasing but choose to never act on them and wish they didnt have them and those who do act on them i recognize bringing up the former group isnt super appropriate when talking about a massive child abuse ring that actually happened and reddit can be as dismissive of pedophilia as they are of rape but its a group i only learned about kinda recently and im wondering what opinions on that whole thing are
ShitRedditSays,removed,kinda disappointed in everyone for not actually adressing this comment in the context in which it was made the comment is about an year old who had sex with a year old thats totally still illegal but does it mean that he wants to have sex with children its a bit grayer and does actually pose good questions of when sex is and is not actually statutory rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,in context its about those acting on it year olds with year olds so a resounding yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes it is you are a complete moron
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt about pedophiles this was a response to a hypothetical question should high school seniors date highschool freshman what the fuck is wrong with people in this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just going to bounce off this top comment to add something in here clicked the link this comment was about year olds dating minors not pedophiles i do not believe an year old should be put on a list and put in prison for dating a year old this happens a lot and lists like that are ineffective do i think offenders and pedos should be locked up absolutely but this specific comment is about teens dating other teens
ShitRedditSays,removed,anita sarkesian hire a pedophile for feminist frequency to play some games to use footage from and moderate the chatroom his old accounts had little girls in bikinis in the favourites and everything
ShitRedditSays,removed,the problem is theyre too broad i dont think a child rapist needs to be on the same list as a year old who has sex with a year old but in general i am in favor of civil commitment for sexually violent offenders they actually cant be trusted
ShitRedditSays,removed,broadcasting the swastika isnt as bad as broadcasting the hammer and sickle which is disturbingly common among this subreddit lets not forget communism has led to the deaths of million people world wide
ShitRedditSays,removed,this seems incredibly unfair do you judge sufferers of other paraphilias similarly or just those whose paraphilia involves attraction to children nbsp obviously if someone acts on this attraction assaults a child purchases or produces child exploitation material etc then this is undoubtedly criminal and reprehensible but the condition itself is surely much more unfortunate than evil
ShitRedditSays,removed,im curious as to what part of that is untrue
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt racism a large problem in japan
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,the woman that is the subject of this post is literally treating men like objects everyone who is making fun of her are absolute savages though
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ what a convoluted and stupid fucking definition of humor youre basically saying because humor is capable of bringing people together it shuns everyone that it doesnt bring together humor goes a long way in bridging differences in race sex etc that clearly doesnt matter here though you guys would rather all keep those divisions by taking offense to everything anyone says
ShitRedditSays,removed,same could be said of anybody
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the quote tries to say that women when viewed sexually are interesting not that they only generate interest when viewed interest
ShitRedditSays,removed,gender dysphoria is a mental illness if and only if sadness is also one the difference between gender dysphoria a normative human response to certain external and internal stimuli and something like body dismorphic disorder an abnormal response in absence of real stimuli is exactly the same as the difference between sadness a normative human response to certain external and internal stimuli and clinical depression an abnormal response from in absence of real stimuli ergo if you can tell the difference between sadness and depression you can understand the difference between gender dysphoria and some other similarlooking mental illness
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol nice good to see some truth being repped on srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,look at that no true scotsman i cant tell whats worse the fact that people justify her behavior as being unfeminist or people agreeing with get behavior
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be honest she is right about being angry about some asshole telling her her dick is huge she over reacted but im no one for tone policing the disgusting thing is people like ethan saying lol he was just talking about how he is fat that shit was not a dad joke and not okay
ShitRedditSays,removed,linking to rgamerghazi whoa infighting
ShitRedditSays,removed,no no dont you get it if a white person breaks the law they lose whiteness points if they get shot by the cops their white status gets revoked immediately
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know this is a reference to a tv series right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think youre tipping your fedora quite hard enough
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre never just joking nobody is ever just joking i mean really is that really all thats going on no one is ever just joking like every terrible joke thread or rroastme or anything like that everyone is absolutely not joking ever
ShitRedditSays,removed,i guess good moral great historically influential
ShitRedditSays,removed,certainly not as harmful as it would have been had a man done something similar how does this work
ShitRedditSays,removed,hitler killed jews because they were jews churchill allowed the death of millions because he despised indians both equally c equally someone genuinely believes this
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah but for every inch under very feminist of her what a nasty person assuming its not satire and no that doesnt excuse the rape comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,source
ShitRedditSays,removed,and we will finish it with god as my witness
ShitRedditSays,removed,good god so not only women saying sexist shit is less offensive than men saying sexist shit but it reduces sexism in society do you offer memberships for the gym where you practice your mental gymnastics youre fucking crazy
ShitRedditSays,removed,does what she said reinforce a sexist society no because it destabilizes the gradient of power that actually does support sexism so the gradient of power flows from men to women so women can get away with obvious objectification and sexism because it doesnt reinforce a sexist society why not why would a woman acting like the troll in question not reinforce sexism in the minds of men and neutral women knee jerk ableism are you a person who believes in gender fluidity and accepts that people can be wolfkin
ShitRedditSays,removed,a timeout for what
ShitRedditSays,removed,she reacted in a shitty way to a shitty thing he did what shitty thing did he do
ShitRedditSays,removed,where did he blatantly say his dick is huge i always took it as a dad joke that was spun by someone looking for a fight and his interview kind of confirmed that idk if i ever saw the whole video but i think ive seen most of it
ShitRedditSays,removed,what he did was not a light hearted joke he blatantly told her his dick is huge i know this is not really the place for discussion and this will probably get removed but i am genuinely curious if you think from seeing the video its certain hes not referring to himself being fat instead of his penis she immediately assumes that but i dont think many people would interpret it that way i more or less agree with everything else you say other than that
ShitRedditSays,removed,hardly ableist mentally ill people can be feminists but its clear this lady has problems a lot deeper than that
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually i retract my last statement this woman isnt even a feminist shes just loco
ShitRedditSays,removed,cant see this on mobile did you write something
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was going to argue but instead im just going acknowledge that this hurts my feelings and move on
ShitRedditSays,removed,then stop going on reddit if you hate it so much
ShitRedditSays,removed,arent those two totally separate issues though i didnt see anyone in that thread advocating for the deportation of muslims surely its possible to be proconstitution and against the deportation of muslims
ShitRedditSays,removed,socialization begins in my balls
ShitRedditSays,removed,women or more specifically biological females have been systematically oppressed because of their biological features in the same way black people have been oppressed they werent oppressed because of how they felt on the inside its brash and inconsiderate to pretend that you can erase and muddy the identities of a people who have been second class citizens for centuries at least recognize that their is a group of people who can be called female or women differentiable from transwomen i sympathize with transwomen but its important to recognize cis females have a unique and very significant struggle different from transwomen gendercritical isnt hate speech
ShitRedditSays,removed,on the bright side after that jump err fall itmight be easier to achieve that
ShitRedditSays,removed,you cant make any money from the black community by pointing out that they are the problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,sugar doesnt dissolve in gas
ShitRedditSays,removed,its something blm needs to stop overlooking the fact is that black people die at the hands of other blacks at alarming rates but almost no attention is paid to those deaths thats the epitome of black lives not mattering the press ignores the loss of black life every day because it doesnt drive ratings
ShitRedditSays,removed,did those guys at least beat the shit out the rapist
ShitRedditSays,removed,the budget was like and they made only on opening weekend hundreds of theaters were literally empty on opening weekend too its a fucking alltogether shit movie idk what youre trying to argue just because it made money it means its good frozen isnt a great movie neither is minions neither is shrek or spiderman yet they are all in top best grossing movies does that magically make them amazing
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah but it still doesnt justify blocking roads what if a heavy vehicle ie wheelers are coming through he cant immediately stop and if they dont move because of there arrogance it leaves with deaths
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean i hate to agree with that guy but this is the internet were talking about rule is a thing here
ShitRedditSays,removed,adjusting for inflation the new movie also cost twice as much the difference between the movies seems correlate quite strongly with the population growth in the us during that timeframe meaning that both movies are basically equally successful even though the original had half the budget
ShitRedditSays,removed,guys that was literally a joke like a joke something someone says to be funny its not like the guy is actually trying to further an anti feminist agenda here
ShitRedditSays,removed,the funniest thing about this is that the fat retards on rshitredditsays will be the first to go when libtards open the door to glorious sharia law no more feminists no more privilege just a patriarchal nationalist racist ultrareactionary see the hazara and misogynist utopia as a occasionally bi cis white male i wiould be sparred and given wives though i wqouldnt accept them have fun with that thought next time you post notallmuslims landwhales
ShitRedditSays,removed,if everyone you know is a racist does it really mean that they are all truly racist or that your view on racism is skewed in a way that almost nobody can be not racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a false equivalency trans women are not real women they have cocks or mutilated cocks speaking the truth has nothing to do with fearing these mentally ill people
ShitRedditSays,removed,nothing wrong with being racist racism exists for a reason it doesnt materialize out of thin air for no reason if every negro you meet is a pants sagging ebonic slurring unintelligent thief that steals your grandmothers lawn mower you have many reasons to dislike that type of negro its funny how the most progressive liberals dont live within miles of a all black neighborhood
ShitRedditSays,removed,i made that commenti dont support ether of those things i dont know what you mean by production of meat so im not going to comment on that
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha you dug deep into my profile
ShitRedditSays,removed,as long as its humane not kept inside then i have problem with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,get a life
ShitRedditSays,removed,what about the black people that voted for him
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes a roof at least
ShitRedditSays,removed,as far as evolution is concerned id say thats fair
ShitRedditSays,removed,trans women are real women well uhh technically nah
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub sucks mongo dick
ShitRedditSays,removed,who are you
ShitRedditSays,removed,im drinkin heavily but fuck this guy he needs the fuckin chair who the fuck kills ppl in church goddam
ShitRedditSays,removed,he a fuckin dick
ShitRedditSays,removed,man spreading is a serious issue please consider donating to rmanspreadingisanissue
ShitRedditSays,removed,bosnians are white so what is wrong with making jokes about killing them or killing some of them for real white people cant experience racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,is it fair that this sub complains about people not using pronouncs not respecting the science behind gender identity and sexuality and then turning around and calling ephebophiles pedophiles seems kinda backwards to me this was always my biggest problem with this sub so ill use my one preban comment to ask you
ShitRedditSays,removed,well what he is saying certainly did play a role in the election
ShitRedditSays,removed,you are such a beautiful person i love you so much i would wash your feet with my hair i would kill myself to save your life
ShitRedditSays,removed,original poster here whats your quarrel you dont like equally for both genders i did not derail the conversation as the conversation is about domestic abuse and men can be domesically abused im not blind to women being abused but why not hit two birds with one stone and say stop domestic abuse on the sign instead by complaining about me hypothetically only talking about men youre the one coming off as short sighted and sexist while i just wanted equality for men who struggle with this issue as well
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you are anti white why dont you leave the western world are you some that much of a masochist that you have to hate yourself and the society you live in why not go live with the people you dont hate is it too scary for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,they dont offend whole groups of people you just think you speak for whole groups of people how can you not see that
ShitRedditSays,removed,islamophibia is fear of muslim people dislike of muslim people is different its a liberal thing to use fear and dislike as synonyms
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is a difference between being scared of something and disliking it i think thats where liberals and regular people have miscommunication he isnt afraid of trans people he doesnt like them fear and dislike are not the same thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this a sub reddit that believes that all white people are evil and racist ive been looking for one
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah not like all white people are racist is a stereotype how did they get that one
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know ill get banned but i would really really like to know how it is possible you think this way can you people really not see how horrible you are the whole world hates you sooooo much and with good reason sjws are what lost you off the top of my head state legislature seats like senate seats a dozen or so house seats and a huge number of governors like or some shit the vast majority of americans have no problem with other races or gays or trans people or anything and we are like state legislature away from a constitutional amendment legalizing recreational electric torture of gay teenagers that is how bad you are
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not racist but this is years old op
ShitRedditSays,removed,got off work to find out fidel castro was outlived by the god damn queen god dammit viva fidel
ShitRedditSays,removed,cucks cucks cucks everywhere in this thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,¡hasta la victoria siempre comandante
ShitRedditSays,removed,why cant you consider a trans woman as an artificial woman i think its perfectly reasonable to not consider them as real because they arent would you insist on a boob job being called real breasts or do you call them fake tits because they are silicone or whatever they used to alter the original breast i dont see the harm in labeling the obviously different as such as long as there is no discriminating action
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is a great argument you sure changed my mind and we can all get along now i was asking a serious question i do not see the harm in identifying a very obscure thing by clear definitions especially when it is trying to imitate a similar but different thing would you be upset if someone gave you diet cherry coke when you asked for regular would it anger you if they insisted it was regular even if you could taste the difference
ShitRedditSays,removed,technically its true a phobia is an irrational fear not a hatred
ShitRedditSays,removed,just kill him
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre not very smart uoratan
ShitRedditSays,removed,op is the only bigot here
ShitRedditSays,removed,go to your safe space johnny it will all be ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,see my first comment here
ShitRedditSays,removed,repeat
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont sim sjws hate men though
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not in a position to defend fidel and so i wont i am aware of his often harsh treatment towards the people of cuba i just meant that had he outlived the queen it would have been a metaphor for antiimperialism i dont know of a single person that approves of his treatment towards lgbt people especially
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you believe your god intended to convey more than one meaning and that muslims being unable to resolve their differences eternally was an intended consequence of this imprecision of communication the koran doesnt explicitly set rules for things outside its scope eg it doesnt tell you whether to buy an iphone or an android at some point islam will spread to places with technologies or behaviours that it adherents must make judgements on based on the limited information contained within religious texts evidently some muslims have decided that genital mutilation is congruent with islamic beliefs regarding the suppression of female sexuality
ShitRedditSays,removed,my point was there is no one interpretation and the many interpretations are evidence of that and that the lack of one interpretation is conducive to the disbelief of a god but putting that aside what are your thoughts on my second paragraph do you think that islam just hasnt had enough time to work its magic in getting rid of mutilation or do you think theres room for acceptance of mutilation in islam
ShitRedditSays,removed,cry srsters cry long and hard your salt sustains me

ShitRedditSays,removed,abusing power why you lost
ShitRedditSays,removed,i usually agree with this subreddit tbh but trump is objectively a better president than clinton despite his racist bigoted remarks sometimes you have to think about how the country will fare with an idiot rather than it being in the hands of a warmongering criminal who intended to go to war with iran while selling arms to afghanistan for her own personal benefit

ShitRedditSays,removed,i wandered in here from rall and consider myself a staunch moderate that leans mostly left but let me give the sjw side of reddit an explanation of what happened the polls were rigged they were obviously oversampling democrats and committing the same political pratfall that the antibrexit side did just recently and that karl rove and fox news did in when you oversample your polls and you have your candidate at points nationally youre only telling your viewers that they dont have to go out and vote this is why rove had a meltdown on election night the grandest political sin of the left is casting down aspersions of racism from on high from places where they have never had to worry about people that dont have to be paid workers comp or minimum wage taking their job or having it exported across the seas to the poor working class of america these are human beings that have legitimate complaints and feelings and worries to dismiss them and their concerns as purely racist is monumentally stupid and careless

ShitRedditSays,removed,roooooooooooooooflllllllllllllllrrrrrrrr fuck u
ShitRedditSays,removed,im confused cant he get a job with health insurance in the usa based on these skills even something part time where you work from home would qualify or make him earn enough for buying his own insurance it would be way faster than looking to immigrate somewhere else even if you could move to another country youd need a visa that allows you to work in europe things like cultural visas wont allow you to work at all and student visas will only allow you to work so many hours per month maybe as its only supposed to cover a take a part time job for a student this is very important because getting access to government services like healthcare will be contingent on having the right kind of visa in france or the uk for instance two countries with decent healthcare as long as youre a student or youre legally employed youll be eligible for healthcare unemployment retirement financial aid from the government so to immigrate with the right kind of paperwork the best way is to first find a job offer contact the employer and do the paperwork to immigrate with a work visa it will be easy in a field like programming where there are lots of job offers that arent getting filled might require someone to change specialties within their field to align with what is in high demand but then it would make getting into the country real easy some of these employers offer really low wages which is why they have a hard time filling those spots itll still be well above minimum wages and even minimum wages in europe are usually livable after some time you can either get temporary residency papers that you need to renew every to years its usually automatic which gives you the same rights as any citizen of your new country usually after some time theres also a way to get permanent resident status or maybe if youre in long term try to go for naturalization
ShitRedditSays,removed,ayy fuck you too

ShitRedditSays,removed,wew lad gonna need to start taking some vasodilators for all the salt in this thread before you ban me from your echo chamber just remember that it is the intolerant racist homophobic literal hitlers that are willing to offer an olive branch first while you continue to beat the drum of division and hate we dont want to deport anyone who has entered this country by legal means and we dont want to oppress or demean any of our fellow americans the only thing we ever wanted all of us was to make america great again if you take the time to get to know us on that common ground i believe you will find we share a lot alike if you ever decide you are ready to join your fellow americans in our endeavour you know where to find us
ShitRedditSays,removed,because millions of people have been shafted anally raped fucked in all holes gangbanged by their government people voted for change and they didnt get fuck all i in no way support trump but i can guarantee that a significant amount of votes were made by people basically saying fuck you to the establishment

ShitRedditSays,removed,see thats why we won god bless america one nation under god usa usa usa republican senate republican house republican white house god emperor in chief libcucks blown the fuck out httpsislimglmeyrdpng
ShitRedditSays,removed,i see maybe as a safety look into options for health insurance he could pay for on his own until the end of grad school it might mean racking up more debt i think a few thousands but in computer science he knows hell be able to repay it without major issues sure its not the best solution but i think it would be a convenient worst case scenario option also a year or two abroad as a student will have him fully covered in terms of health insurance at least in france which is the only place where i can tell for sure might have to pay a year more to not even get our equivalent of copays which mostly occur for smaller stuff like gp visits sure the year abroad will cost him might not be too much or even nothing more than what he already pays if his uni has an exchange program with a european institution but it looks good on a résumé and still beats paying the same thing just to get some insurance out of it instead of some international experience student visas are way easier to get dont allow you to work much and are limited in time so governments are less reluctant to issue these especially to people who are unlikely to turn into illegal immigrants
ShitRedditSays,removed,take it away spongebob
ShitRedditSays,removed,president trump president trump president trump
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am so glad i turned out this way maybe now the new age racists go a bit easier with the constant racism against white people the last months were eye opening in this regard from twitter to facebook to reddit to neogaf you had countless social justice fascist pretend or maybe even actually believe they fight against racism while almost constantly say stuff about one group of people whites that if they said the exact same thing to literally any other group they would be rightfully screamed down as racists this really obvious shit from these new age racists is also one reason why many people voted trump dont think no one notices this crap
ShitRedditSays,removed,in that case a long vacation or student exchange to europe is the best answer even counting cost of living for two people if you wanted to follow it would be cheaper than private insurance and he could get a job there out of university and move back to the usa whenever he finds a job there with good insurance
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys have no idea how smug i am right now down with liberal bigotry maga
ShitRedditSays,removed,ban me all you want but we have still won and you have still lost

ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahahahahahahahahhahaha
ShitRedditSays,removed,please share
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are you people so dramatic nothing will change and if it does it changes again in years for better
ShitRedditSays,removed,hhhnngggghh your tears are delicious
ShitRedditSays,removed,just one last thing if you go anywhere outside the uk double check which universities offer grad school programs with classes in english in the same country it might be standard in some universities and in others absolutely everything is in the local language usually the universities in the capital cities has classes in english but outside of it there is no guarantee dont hesitate to shoot an email to the person in charge of that specific grad school program which is too bad because the nicest places to live in most of europe are outside of those big cities and it can be half as expensive in terms of cost of life for a student ive seen international students being very frustrated in france since they didnt speak fluently by picking a well ranked university and assuming it would offer courses in several languages look for places offering things called a european master class or similar name its usually a grad school program where youre supposed to study between major european universities so since the students are from all over europe the classes tend to be taught exclusively in english
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just want to thank you all for being so salty i look forward to dragging you guys along kicking and screaming as we make america great again your welcome

ShitRedditSays,removed,no attacking someone because of their race would be hate
ShitRedditSays,removed,if hugs by noose is what you meant you are correct i hope bisexual latinas are first on the gallows
ShitRedditSays,removed,tumblr sounds perfect for ya bud
ShitRedditSays,removed,what specifically are you afraid of
ShitRedditSays,removed,so the other option is putting a man bill clinton back in the white house that used his power to sexually assault women and once stuck a cigar in a womans vagina oh yea talking about sexual assault is much worse
ShitRedditSays,removed,life is a joke as it is dont take it too seriously
ShitRedditSays,removed,they delusional basement dwellers ignore em

ShitRedditSays,removed,im white and i voted for trump your theory holds water
ShitRedditSays,removed,i came looking for salt and was not disappointed
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyone knows its because the polls dont show us anything worthwhile theyre always skewed to make it look like the party who they want to win is doing well people who think the polls are accurate in any way are fools
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh no poor you you poor thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,white supremacists lol sooooo dramatic

ShitRedditSays,removed,bye felicia
ShitRedditSays,removed,not an argument for accelerationism too late now accelerationism is here starting last night we are all accelerationists
ShitRedditSays,removed,who are you kidding we the masses are still gonna shit post make off color comments and youll still be here years from now to nitpick and nag its a bad codependent relationship all yall cant break out of
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah because a corrupt criminal only lost because of her gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,i doubt the main issue is sexism considering white women voted over for trump though im sure sexism did play a part i really do think hillary just isnt likeable to a lot of people i had a few womenwhite on my facebook post about how its time for a female president but why does it have to be her
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe people just dont like hillary
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao the polls were off cause they all say among likely voters at the end and they just assumed that the millions of new voters who turned out in the primaries wouldnt turn up for the general the polls were either apropaganda aimed at moderate republicans to hopefully lower turnout or bwishful thinking by left leaning pollsters as far as hiding support goes it wasnt pol or ledonald responsible for that it was the millions of unreasonable spiteful leftists who have been trying to make any trump supporters lives living hell
ShitRedditSays,removed,quotenobody is forgetting about mens problems while pointing out womenquote err back on planet earth there is almost no attention paid to male abuse victims canadas only male abuse shelter was shut down due to no government funding after the owner went into debt and hung himself the female abuse shelters and feminazis also sought to block any funding go to canadas only shelter for men iirc are you trying to claim male dimestic abuse victims get equal or even proportional treatmentsupportattentionfunding as do female domestic abuse victims because honestly your and other comnents in this thread are nothing short of risible
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty much yeah
ShitRedditSays,removed,sjws arent really the i support civil rights kind of people they are the im offended crowd that wants to change everything see laci green on youtube
ShitRedditSays,removed,well lets just say its no coincidence that in black men are are imprisoned whereas only in white men are imprisoned also why crime rates are so high in states where blacks are the majority
ShitRedditSays,removed,yea the problem is probably the way the were raised because they were raised by black parents
ShitRedditSays,removed,yep just like the mods and all you lot in this place
ShitRedditSays,removed,just like muslims are radicalized to become isis because they are discriminated against
ShitRedditSays,removed,it turns out that when you support a movement entirely based on the desire to shit on women who work on video games a desire to shit on women is a pathoscentered not a logoscentered standard so that political activists cant be held accountable to their own rules
ShitRedditSays,removed,le ebil bolshevik commie boogeyman mass murder and widespread environmental destruction are okay as long as they helps achieve the final state of history comrade
ShitRedditSays,removed,political centrist im color blind leftwing extremists literally a neonazi rightwing extremists jewish cuckservative tool they say that a good compromise position should make both parties miserable
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats bad about racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not that theyre defining things such that they are free to move the goal posts but rather that theyre not even defining things at all this is all a textbook exercise of psychological and rhetorical manipulation and i can prove it what is the problem seeking to be addressed by gamergate that women are being shit on by men this is a visual statement invoking in the readers imagination a visual of a woman laying prostrate as a hirstute massive donald trump white man squatting over her chest and proceeding to defacate this is infuriating to anyone who believes in womens rights and manipulates the sympathetic reader into a state of anger but nowhere in this visual is there something like an objective metric women are only x of programmers despite making up of the population or something like a proposed scientific or sociological mechanism described in clean positivist statements the extreme right does something very similar to the extreme left anyone who is not a racist is branded a cuckservative which is a visual statement of a petite white girl being penetrated by a black man who smacks his lips and breathes through his teeth but nowhere in this extremely offensive visual is there anything like an objective standard explaining how white people are in danger of being extinct
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you mean bill clinton
ShitRedditSays,removed,its for the same reason you cant even trash talk in any trump based sub and try to post in raskreddit a bunch of fuckin gaping pussies that cant be bothered to see why their nerfed out bots perma ban people for nearly nothing
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre like the kid who didnt read the book but has to write about it with a word count requirement the book is even worse according to actual intellectual leftie theory the source of all racism sexism etc is something called false consciousness which is an omnipotent omniscient ubiquitous eternal entity created by the forces of history which causes people to like what is opposite to their own interests you see it is impossible that women could actually want to support gamergate because they believe in it rather women have been fooled by reactionary forces into a kind of false consciousness into supporting it its completely nebulous and cannot be disproven by counter example
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes trump is awful to women and a step backward im not disagreeing to that in the slightest however hes hardly the first of his kind
ShitRedditSays,removed,hopefully we can catch him on the street with a trump hat and beat his ass or vandalize his car
ShitRedditSays,removed,this subreddit is a massive circle jerk or self righteous plebs i
ShitRedditSays,removed,for the most part people want change a family of five has to spend dollars a month of shitty ass obama care when last decade it was like dollars a month
ShitRedditSays,removed,this entire sub is satire right
ShitRedditSays,removed,can we sterilize all white men now or do we have to wait for further reason gathering
ShitRedditSays,removed,you probably want to elaborate on your perceived atrocities he committed for easier debunking
ShitRedditSays,removed,bash
ShitRedditSays,removed,what an idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,cuba and castro were actually huge allies to the international lgbtq movement despite what you may have heard
ShitRedditSays,removed,get a new account then
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit its the she has a vagina argument but you are completely serious yeah fuck off
ShitRedditSays,removed,ganymede
ShitRedditSays,removed,serious question is the sole fact of commenting somewhere damnable
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think its making fun of retarded people like the beginning of the word retard making them seem like pokemon like how pokemon can only say part of their name usually
ShitRedditSays,removed,the noise in this issue it getting too full of static if a man and a woman are both managers at walmart both are doing same work and should be getting same pay but noise makers come in and say that both men and women that work at walmart are not getting the same pay then neglect that the man is working management and the woman is working cashier
ShitRedditSays,removed,they dont get paid based on how popular they are among americans they get paid based upon how many worldwide views they receive it does not how many people care about the team what matters is the number of worldwide views they receive popularity is based upon how many worldwide views they get not by how much people want them to win this argument that you made is even less logically sound then the last one maybe if you did not always think through a feminist lens then you could make a rational argument
ShitRedditSays,removed,so who are you supposed to be the cool guy that points out the guy that pointed out the copy pasta gtfo
ShitRedditSays,removed,complete nonsense i never said that men should get paid more i said as they get more international views they this get more money you are repeating the same bullshit that you said before
ShitRedditSays,removed,such as
ShitRedditSays,removed,because the life of a human matters less than the life of two animals whose main purpose is to serve as attractions fuck you reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,takes one to know one i guess ¯ツ¯
ShitRedditSays,removed,cucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,as somebody with an advanced stem degree fuck these stemlords that think the only reason to get an education is so you can whore yourself out to industry for years and retire comfortably
ShitRedditSays,removed,eat a dick come at me
ShitRedditSays,removed,hillarys a cunt bag just a mess of a woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair their lives would only be wrecked for like another hours or so that said its usually considered normal to prefer emotionally meaningful sex not to mention fucking consent
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are you an asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,a mans life is over if hes convicted of a false rape do they play it up yes but that sex offender registry fucks your life up forever can you blame them for being terrified of it
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people are fucking crazy
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think its weird that im not banned from here after so long
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you label an entire group of millions and millions of people as bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao just leave people talk shit about tumblr all the time but at least theyre not on it themselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats pretty sad actually
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is the subreddit to call out racism hate phobias of all sorts no what kind of cognitive dissonance do you experience on the daily
ShitRedditSays,removed,any more so than the women who think all men are rapists
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you saying they arent absolutely terrible
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats pretty fucking racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,bigot a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions if you allow positives while barring negatives you show a clear bias
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao look at how pathetic you are fighting your whole life for social equality and now defending a bunch of racist white women hows that degree in gender studies working out for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,not a valued degree at all there is no labour market for it economics and the labour market dont care which genitals you havedont have you are all a net drag on the economy and society at large as a result hope we start putting you guys in political prisons lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,and now you guys dont arent you guys supposed to be better than the shit reddit tries to do
ShitRedditSays,removed,every alls
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree theres no problem with the lack of men in the picture but if the same picture was posted with a group of white men thered be definitely controversy created about it not necessarily by this sub but in general
ShitRedditSays,removed,the fact that they are practically advertising they dont have any male staff makes it a gender diversity problem no especially when huff post bangs on about diversity a lot
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just trying to know what is your thought process about this group of white men generates controversy about lack of diversity reddit makes some stupid shitty comments like theyre all there because they deserve to or some shit group of white women reddit tries to generate controversy about lack of diversity you criticise them for caring about diversity only when its about women isnt this just whataboutism from both sides
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh you mean the purpose of this entire subreddit i guess now i know why i fear the night hahaha love u
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh i dont actually care i just thought theyd have at least male editor i wonder if they have any muslims working for them tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,geologist hahahaah how pretty are your rocks homeboy would you like some fine greengreen to inhale so that the reflections are doper oh no my empty hollow existence llol gotchya tbh though i think you should just take one of those rocks and test the density of it with your forehead as a tool in this way you will actually contribute meaning full datainformation to society sorry i meant to say hey ur a chick and a geologist major whats a good pumice stone from wiping the dead skin off my feet thanks bb
ShitRedditSays,removed,a mod of a sub that targets hate groups with the username liberalparadise is calling me obtuse self awareness conscious knowledge of ones own character feelings motives and desires
ShitRedditSays,removed,dehumanizing but not really wrong you cant outexercise a bad diet
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this subreddit satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,as an anarchist i take issue with an allfemale corporate boardroom being praised as progress for womens rights it seems to ignore capitalism as a mode of oppression in my view seeing all these reactionaries getting riled up about it still makes me chuckle though
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would it have black women in it theyre fucking useless
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know if you ever met gb but i dont think hes intellectually capable of that
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok i couldnt follow all of that but what i learned is that there was a seriously homophobic idiot who i think believes all muslims are radical but when i replied to you it was because you said your opinion was controversial and i assumed you meant a large number of people disagreed with you
ShitRedditSays,removed,no bash the fash say i
ShitRedditSays,removed,in the uk would be the legal age of consent so there would be no issue here legally anyway
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know what is a surprise the term nerf as a verb is not gamer jargon and goes back at least as far as george carlin if not nerf itself
ShitRedditSays,removed,feminism is created by kikes to destroy the nuclear family unit
ShitRedditSays,removed,racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound like a racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry i am so far away i can barely hear you make a solid point
ShitRedditSays,removed,wonder why a nigger can call me a honky but i cant call a nigger a nigger makes you think
ShitRedditSays,removed,watch the clip lol she clearly has a crush on him
ShitRedditSays,removed,watch the clip lol she clearly has a crush on him
ShitRedditSays,removed,hate fuck aka rape thats not what hate fuck means
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets be racist to show that racism is wrong haha
ShitRedditSays,removed,because theyre the majority of the population
ShitRedditSays,removed,not to be intolerant
ShitRedditSays,removed,why you gotta bring up old shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,way to prove his point
ShitRedditSays,removed,mood
ShitRedditSays,removed,ban purple people they are ruining the economy and taking our jobs
ShitRedditSays,removed,david attenborough voice when under attack the conspirators make a high pitched squeal similar to that of a frog its not every effective david attenborough voice
ShitRedditSays,removed,my first thought was i bet mama got ass tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,where do these loser virgin nerds live where cellulite and body rolls arent things experienced by all women
ShitRedditSays,removed,get a sense of humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,male or female
ShitRedditSays,removed,because the whole concept is a fucking joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound a little flustered over this issue honestly this happens in real life but thats if you know the people so ill give you that
ShitRedditSays,removed,superfuckingwittyburnbro
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this an antitrans meme it all started when the wave feminists would attack someone questioning them when they use the gender specific term himher in passing it wasnt until someone said that they identify as an attack helicopter that feminists dropped it and try to claim did you just assume my gender was antitrans no no one gives a fuck if youre transgender in the sense that there are only two genders when these third wave feminists decide they are some made up gender because they act a little like the other gender while throwing in their sexual preference to their gender identity it makes me wonder when did transgendered become such a pointlessly broad term why do wave feminists have to make a distinction between themselves and others then give that distinction a name whats wrong with saying im a gay male and letting others that get closer to you figure out the rest
ShitRedditSays,removed,omg thats horrible are you okay though
ShitRedditSays,removed,f
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbf tumblr did have a problem for a while with using tw tags for nontriggers but thats why the content warningcw tag started
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt people ripping on a site theyre currently actively making use of
ShitRedditSays,removed,u just got urself hired as one of the teachers
ShitRedditSays,removed,in all fairness humor is subjective
ShitRedditSays,removed,but how could we stop them from seeing breakfast i agree with you but still
ShitRedditSays,removed,crazy feels sooo good until you hear the throwing knives thudding and rattling around you on your way to work in the morning because she doesnt want you to leave but yeah rational cant compete with crazy women in the sack
ShitRedditSays,removed,ah yellow rose good to see youre still being a consistent drain on the quality of reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,do they actually think civilization will collapse because of minor things that offend them you mean like most the pots calling the kettle black no weve got all these safe spaces and trigger warnings across college campuses because these little snowflakes cant handle hearing something that might be considered mildly upsetting but no cant possibly be the sjws being soft blame everyone else i now welcome my ban with open arms because disturbing the sjw echo chamber is a cardinal sin in triggerland
ShitRedditSays,removed,spoken like a dude whos sexually deprived and has no ability or selfawareness of his in ability to attract the ladies
ShitRedditSays,removed,may not agree with his whole statement but you must be able to recognize the ridiculousness of the woman in the video he was commenting to granted we dont know what the man with the truck exactly said but it seems by the womans own admission all he said was hello just sayin based on that video the woman looked crazy
ShitRedditSays,removed,im proud to have been a part of this and i hope my sadcringe colleague uformershitposter is proud of making it here well done sir well done
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy fuck your all neckbeard apologists look at the fucking context of the video he was robbed by a stereotypical hood black guy blame the fucking black guy for living up to the stereotype you fucking inbred idiots
ShitRedditSays,removed,its pretty ironic that these are the same people ridiculing sjws for safe spaces trigger warnings etc when the mere mention of the word black sends them into a paranoid panic
ShitRedditSays,removed,no thats reich
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be that guy even most white guys self included find these fuckers to be sick fucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,for fucks sake adult women are hotter seriously ashley graham is way cuter than some middle schooler all the pedophilic grossness aside and its entirely gross lets be real theyre not even factually correct
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you have sources on this id like to use this but i need help finding sources
ShitRedditSays,removed,dude saying whites are inferior is just as bad as saying blacks are inferior stop generalizing to an entire group of people
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats some pretty wide assumption making there wew
ShitRedditSays,removed,he was referring to this incident a guy said hello to a woman and she freaked out on him
ShitRedditSays,removed,he was referring to this incident a guy said hello to a woman and she freaked out on him
ShitRedditSays,removed,shouldnt white people be committing more crime to make it proportional
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you serious right now the post was removed because of the prison rape references and because you brought it up in modmail and in the comments yet youre still going to link the comments here which could potentially cause problems for us on our end
ShitRedditSays,removed,its baffling how educated you sound while destroying your own arguments wait i know throw in some sarcasm about muh statistics the bottom line from your own data is that white people are disproportionately less likely to commit crimes compared to the white population all of that says nothing of individuals judging any individual by actions of others is abhorrent ive lived in white areas black areas hispanic areas and various mixes of those three by far the worst statistically was the mixed black and white areas i base that off of renters insurance premiums as they were levied by zip code in my personal experience i was the victim of property crime most frequently while living in the wealthiest of white areas among my experience crime happens everywhere criminals come in all colors crime statistics however tend to support the damn racists
ShitRedditSays,removed,feel free to offer yourself for exploitation if more people like you do it one day well no longer have any problem eye for an eye right
ShitRedditSays,removed,one of the sine qua non aspects of anarchism if this confuses you is that authority is bullshit a transitional dictatorship of the proletariat every time yall implemented it turned out to neither be transitional or of the proletariat it was just dictatorship not wanting to be ruled over by some tyrannical jackass doesnt make me reactionary i dont want a new ruling class i want rulership to die
ShitRedditSays,removed,and because youre doing it with one more layer of irony its alright
ShitRedditSays,removed,but why is it called wage gap if its about society or whatever
ShitRedditSays,removed,just curious how is this comment any better than what the op posted the source of isnt saying all whites should have found another country racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,posting memes with this mods face which he shared publicly on it isnt doxxing so fuck off
ShitRedditSays,removed,because giving that land to black bourgeois landlords makes so much of a difference obviously
ShitRedditSays,removed,mugabe gave the land to his useless cronies who promptly ruined its agricultural capacity and left the common zimbabwean to suffer under miserable economic oppression just like before
ShitRedditSays,removed,im pretty sure this post is about protecting young muslim girls from genital mutilation or is that a problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,is free speech really that hard of a concept to grasp if you dont like you dont like it but a fairly large portion of the population hold it pretty dear
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a big difference between having an organised parade agreed with by the city and walking out into the middle of the freeway its the same reason you dont see people using those arguments for gay pride
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sexually identify as brd
ShitRedditSays,removed,are people who teach gender studies really academics though i feel like you should be contributing to human knowledge in some way and not just making shit up
ShitRedditSays,removed,physics
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean ive taken a look at some of things that have come out of gender studies like gender is a social construction and not managed to find any hard evidence of it even when searching academic journals im willing to change my mind about this but nothing ive seen so far would go to suggest that they have the same kind of rigor as in physics maths or philosophy
ShitRedditSays,removed,not australian but imho its okay to use as a nongendered insult i think that it has a time and place though and should be kept off the fempire im also from the deep south so standards may very
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah no one is denying that sjw theories and other nonsense come out of academia doesnt mean any of that shit holds water i know doctors that claim vaccines cause autism for fucks sake
ShitRedditSays,removed,this but unironically
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is just the best sub thank you all great work
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wish we could line up all white people and get a fucking firing squad on them
ShitRedditSays,removed,some people dont want to have sex with the opposite sex that needs to be respected some people dont want to have sex while theyre shitfaced drunk drugged up or unconscious that needs to be respected some people dont want to have sex with creepy dudes who prey on children that needs to be respected some people dont want to have sex with you even if you incessantly compliment them or try to buy them laced drinks at the club that needs to be respected wow weird how this all works huh
ShitRedditSays,removed,admittedly i have only meet irl a handful or well low teens of trans people and a few of them i got the gender wrong at first but i have never see actually people use this irl not really baiting but is this really all that common outside of maybe the person being an asshole to a trans person i just really dont get where reddit is getting the this totally happens to me all the time outside of the one or two online trolls spamming it and people thinking it is true
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay so im out of the loop here apparently could you please enlighten me on the ways of chopping peoples hands off because you dont agree with them or about that fempire youre talking about id seriously love to know
ShitRedditSays,removed,what does trump have to disclose hes not the long time politician and he doesnt have to be honest just more honest than clinton which is plausible considering the shit that hillary got up to over the years
ShitRedditSays,removed,because they can relate to the accused
ShitRedditSays,removed,it seems wrong to call something an illness if it doesnt actually cause a problem i guess gender dysphoria is a mental illness in that sense but gender itself is not
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you guys actually serious
ShitRedditSays,removed,its popular therefore it isnt bad but also fuck pop music and justin gaybear
ShitRedditSays,removed,but it was an askreddit thread someone asked for his opinion or am i wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,if free speech means tolerating nazis and pedophiles then fuck free speech acquaint their heads with the pavement its the only correct response
ShitRedditSays,removed,not like its particularly edgy either incest jokes are fairly common ground
ShitRedditSays,removed,that does happen sometimes though right i understand its rare but that does happen though and it is awful and the commenter later went on to condemn the assaulter
ShitRedditSays,removed,fascists never understand how they deserve to be treated they think they deserve to eat caviar when they should only be eating pavement
ShitRedditSays,removed,blah blah acquaint their head with the pavement
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is false and is victimblaming i cannot believe this attitude is being seen as acceptable
ShitRedditSays,removed,so if the protestors get shot its the fault of the person who shoots them but the people who are punching and throwing things arent at fault because trump supporters provoked them how do you deal with this huge gap in logic
ShitRedditSays,removed,she doesnt understand how women in slutty clothing deserve to be treated how the fuck can you support blatant victimblaming
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know who the fuck youre talking about you sound like a fag though
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a pretty clever joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are talking about shooting someone in self defence because these terrorists attack people
ShitRedditSays,removed,um no they didnt they actually may have damaged their ecosystem via their methods of firestick farming which involved burning down swathes of forests in order to hunt easily give credit where credit is due in this case being the inhabitants of the fertile crescent
ShitRedditSays,removed,commie scum like you deserve to be gassed
ShitRedditSays,removed,trump will be president bitches you cant censor this
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was reading that thread and i am certain that he was being sarcastic the context was that some idiot in slovakia blocked an ambulance and when questioned he claimed he was helping them
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know who wouldnt want trump as president
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty sure trump supporters have been getting it waaayyy worse for the past several months
ShitRedditSays,removed,but isnt it you who is relating the word thug to black people in this situation i think thats the most racist thing about this
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry i dont want to raise another mans child im sure there are plenty that do though everyone has their own preferences
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol you were rude to me so now i can justifiably be a bigot that makes sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am confident i am going to be instantly banned here for offering unwelcome opinions that being said i would still like to share my thoughts on thsee issues and hope to receive some sort of constructive criticism so that i may rid myself of false beliefs from my experience when a person says they are colorblind with respect to race it means that that they are aware of their own potential for bias and prejudice and try their best to not let a persons skin color affect the way they would treat that person it means not committing the injustice of applying broad sweeping trends to the individual it does not mean ignoring all societal problems that involve race american protestantism is a very tribalistic form of religion that is initially hostile to anything deemed as other this has happened throughout american history for instance with the italian catholic immigrants in the who were seen as brown people with a strange religion even today in the south people hate the catholics also because the mexicans are largely catholic although islam has taken its place as the primary strange religion that those brown people follow by the way islam is also a conquering faith the ottoman empire was an islamic empire that dominated a very large area of the world for hundreds of years and succeeded in conquering a significant portion of europe turkey west of the bosphorus spain bosnia etc i agree with you that going out of your way to wear clothing that you know will be viewed as offensive by some people is just bad taste and is dearning of scorn furthermore i am confused as to why anyone would ever put any effort at all into making a statement with their clothing except when such a statement would be for the purpose furthering their own position in life job interview etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks for proving my point in full
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get that sweet karma is what makes the world go round but this seems pretty tongue in cheek guys
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus fuck youre intent on being offended yes you do have a right to not be harassedstalkedsent death threats they are covered by law what you dont have a right to is controlling how your brain works none of us do and none of us can i could be petrified of being eaten by a dinosaur doesnt mean anyones going to give me dinosaur security guards no matter how much i whine about my rights crimes of all types in the usa have been in steady decline since and almost halved in that time to imply the government arent doing enough to make you safe is horseshit to say the government arent doing enough to make you feel safe is noones problem but your own go see a therapist
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha thats really funny cos thats basically the narrative of this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,threats of violence are generally to be treated just as harshly as actual for the most part at least within the libertarian branch however threats of violence arent what people are referring to when people are talking about people not feeling safe if someone is not causingintending or threatening to do you harm in any way and you still feel unsafe then thats a matter of personal responsibility and the fault lies on the one who doesnt feel safe in that instance
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive never understood why people in srs say burn it all down but then keep coming to the website
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you ever met a redditors with an atheist username who wasnt a giant moron
ShitRedditSays,removed,with a sense of humour its a difficult concept but im sure you can grasp it
ShitRedditSays,removed,huh its almost like theres different people with differing opinions which im sure cant be right last i checked we were all fat incel shebeasts that shared a common brain
ShitRedditSays,removed,its almost like you live in a world without causality or do you think that the same comment would get the same result in twox and trp youre upset at people having their own echo chambersafe space and heres something that might blow your fucking mind what if the majority of people using this site did see lgbt representation as pandering and they did sexualize every female they saw or do you disagree with democracy
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are really out of touch
ShitRedditSays,removed,because at its core a personthingwhatever wants to be special in some way by constantly correcting how society inadvertently addresses them in basic conversation it shows a level of arrogance most find detestable
ShitRedditSays,removed,im wondering if you understand how infuriating it is to have someone rename themselves just because i know its their right but honestly it is equally and totally my right to refuse to play the game you can say im insensitive fine but youre being equally as insensitive to have the expectation that i would play the persons game in the first place its a two way street i much like many other simply refuse to play you said its not arrogant to expect others well as a matter of fact the exact definition of arrogant is as follows having or revealing an exaggerated sense of ones own importance or abilities so im going to say yes it is arrogant well at least by my and other english speakers definition it as such
ShitRedditSays,removed,transphobic i just googled that holeshit im actually stunned this exists want some fun youtube time put transphobic into search let the special snowflakes flowwwww as for self righteous thats not entirely fair really it is a comment from me its really had to not come off as self righteous if you arent simply sharing a link to something else most comments come from the perspective of the person commenting they are at their core very self righteous at the essence of simply clicking commentreply you would be assuming people want to read what you have to say makes false equivalences not from my perspective makes the issue about themselves would you be happy if i spoke in the person about someone else says pompous shit like good day sir that was a joke on the topic of gender association calling them sir or madam get it
ShitRedditSays,removed,finally im famous thank you for your negative attention and thus validation
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not sure gender self association or whatever we are talking about right now would be considered common courtesy youre making a huge assumption that its common which let me tell you it isnt maybe in the safe zones of liberal collages this type of crap is commonplace but let me break it to you its not in rest of the world its weird strange and not accepted by most perhaps one day when it is accepted by more than a couple thousand social warriors it could be considered common when did simply saying no become being a dick no im not going to participate in this not playing the name game and its simply rude to consider that i should need to you can drop the sir or madam by the way nobody believes the facade of politeness youre putting on especially with your refusal to treat trans people properly and comparing their identities to games because it is a game its some sort of random social game that these people seem to think everyone who doesnt think their way should be a apart of do this call me this if you dont youre insensitive well fuck you how that for insensitive take your self opinion of whatever gender you happen to pick today and go fuck yourself with it the answer will be no had to hear that these days but simply telling someone no seems to make people crazy down voting me wont change shit it wont make me accept your stance on this crap just know that im in the majority on this topic and time is simply on my side gender identity recognition or whatever the hell we are talking about will one day be cataloged right next to flower children or people of the world take youre crazy and go home
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean the first joke was pretty funny though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know its a circlequeef but despite the horrifically depressing evidence to the contrary there are some white males who dont buy into their buckshot some
ShitRedditSays,removed,then go to fuckin tumblr where people will respect your safe spaces and wont trigger you with talk of there only being men and women and none of that other bullshit that people make up in their heads
ShitRedditSays,removed,then you must be a really fuckin sad person
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes but you seem like a feeeeeeeeeeemale to me therefore you are one
ShitRedditSays,removed,its pretty funny tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah but thats like your opinion man
ShitRedditSays,removed,you should move to africa
ShitRedditSays,removed,people make fun of the institution of racism by making obviously ridiculous jokes about it and stereotypesits sarcasm im sorry but if you cant see that then you might need to grow thicker skin that type of humor has been around for a while hell its not even specifically racism people can make fun of any stereotype by making a joke like that you have to view the situation with context if the person is constantly making racist remarks then yeah the joke is intended to be racist and demean others if the person has no history with racism or even supports movements or the premise of certain movements but not the movement itself that are in favor for equality then i dont see anything wrong with them making a sarcastic joke about it we should be able to live life and laugh at dark humor from time to time its really important to differentiate the two
ShitRedditSays,removed,no reason to explain anything to these people theyre all delusional
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think it all depends on who your audience is at that point if they understand that you dont mean what youre saying then its completely fine to use them for shock value just not in excess i mean look at louis ck the guy drops racial slurs occasionally in his shows because it adds to the value of his jokes almost all of the shit he says is obviously overexagerated or overtly prejudiced but he doesnt mean itand most of the world knows that our culture has conditioned us to not go near those words and the concepts theyre tied towhich is completely fine and makes perfect sensebut its not like saying it as part of a dark joke immediately makes you racist as i said before you should definitely make sure its a clever one and you know your audience understands that you dont mean it
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats probably why you dont get laid and lets be honest you definitely dont with that attitude if you had any kind of grasp on your own presumably female shudder anatomy you must be horrified to learn that any guy thats ever been unlucky enough to actually penetrate you has gotten your juices on him without his consent gasp jesus get a grip
ShitRedditSays,removed,recently on shittyreactiongifs mods have seen to remove all comments that dont end in blacklivesmatter thus we get this sort of protesting very biased to not include the blm hashtag in this posts title seeing as its probably the majority of the reason this redditor said what he said in the first place
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats really how the entire subs sees the whole forced blacklivesmatter hashtag yeah this is really proving blacklivesmatters top notch awareness true beacons of morality and leadership
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wrote this comment on my alt
ShitRedditSays,removed,the schizophrenia of redditors will never cease to amaze me like they say diversity is very important but they hate brown people and have white social circles wild
ShitRedditSays,removed,this shit is why nobody likes this sub i came looking for a tongueincheek forum of social justice and found an inverted tia
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry if i offended you dont be be proud that you made the sjws mad and keep triggering being linked here is better than gold
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not once you go beyond humor memes turn out to be a horrible way of communicating facilitating discussion those idiots consider memes a legitimate argument
ShitRedditSays,removed,easy hoss
ShitRedditSays,removed,well youre a srs poster and youre still here so you got that going for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,umailtears i like your posts and agree with them as i should as a male id like to ask if you think its ok for males to view porn with female nudity andor masturbate freely i dont want to do anything that would be disrespectful for women
ShitRedditSays,removed,go home gamer girl
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you he is white
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not that clearly cut tbh if i ever should get a severely crippling injury with no chance of recovery id be fine with getting euthanized to spare my loved ones from pain and hardship
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you ill try my best to follow your advice
ShitRedditSays,removed,shes referring to the inevitable demise of males not females
ShitRedditSays,removed,harambe didnt die for this
ShitRedditSays,removed,dae the blacks are gorillas
ShitRedditSays,removed,i like the meme and dont think anything about it is racist it started as a parody of those posts people make when celebrities die and is very animal rights centric
ShitRedditSays,removed,to claim the wage gap does not exist would be stupid but to claim that the wage gap is even in the top of american issues would be just as stupid as it is slowly closing itself when you adjust for the diferent jobs many men and women have that being said i and hopefully most others agree it is an issue that needs to be solved i just think as of now there are bigger fish to fry
ShitRedditSays,removed,rjokes does not care if you were offended
ShitRedditSays,removed,who ever complained about an animal meme being racist because of the irish indentured servants
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think theyre trying to make a comparison to when people were saying worse than the paris terrorist attacks is the fact that people predicted it might happen which is so true though those bigots predicted it would happen and thats pretty much the cause of why it happened by the way your flair is a little insensitive to those who were persecuted during crusades etc a paladin conjurs up images of rampaging crusaders killing peaceful muslims who didnt do anything please think about others feelings and consider changing it to something more friendly it may be a trigger word or trigger imagery for some
ShitRedditSays,removed,and you still havent
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahah its funny cuz muslims are terrorists get it
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you know hes a man do you know there areall types of women out there and they are allowed to gasp have different opinions
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just come here to find funny and true posts to upvote
ShitRedditSays,removed,was it in a lower comment the dude says there is between of a wage gap between men and women the problem here is someone saying women make less than men in this country is technically correct but its akin to my surgeons make more than burger king workers type metaphor that i hinted at earlier he literally says he believes there is a wage gap just the way its put forth often with those ridiculous statistics implying the same work less pay idea is a myth
ShitRedditSays,removed,well its the person from the top comment perhaps dishonest is a strong word but saying wage gap implies for example a difference in hourly pay from men to women in the same job working less hours is far less sinister of a situation because its something that more likely to be in the control of the worker i suppose im arguing a bit of semantics here but some of this stuff doesnt equate to a literal wage gap thanks for the suggestion
ShitRedditSays,removed,oddly enough white supremacists dont like him either
ShitRedditSays,removed,more of a life choice gap but that does not absolve men of their role in creating it
ShitRedditSays,removed,no kidding in fact thats what helped him win
ShitRedditSays,removed,one of the few west point cadets to ever graduate without a single demerit and he becomes a confederate general go fucking figure i bet he was a stem lord
ShitRedditSays,removed,that seems a little exclusionary towards the white people here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope you end up having to heal from degree burns over percent of your body
ShitRedditSays,removed,we need a safe space from the oppression
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes i do
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah wtf why is that orange faced pile of crap the usas president
ShitRedditSays,removed,calling out injustice does not entail breaking windows punching people stealing other peoples property and lighting peoples hair on fire it seems like the ends justify the means with the left except the ends are nowhere to be seen since these protests changed nothing
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one remembers the white people who get shot do they because they dont matter they dont fit the narrative even though there are more white dead bodies than black ones
ShitRedditSays,removed,til critique of power rioting and death threats
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyone remembers the civil war and slavery just ask my white friends dad he was a confederate general who owned slaves wait what what do you mean the civil war and slavery very ended over years ago every confederate and slave owner died centuries ago and public opinion has shifted to the point that even suspicion of racism can get you fired and socially ostracized when did all this happen i thought this was amerikkka
ShitRedditSays,removed,i believe the word that describes this situation is hypocrisy calling white people mayonnaise is okay because some white people and antiblm minorities accused blm supporters who are not all black of being thugs after multiple protests turned into riots baltimore and portland i am secure in my selfrighteousnesss
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpwwwcheapsexynightgirlscom
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know what else has been irritating the amount of liberals complaining you cant fight hate with hate like no i get it not all trump supporters are racist but the ones that are openly white supremacists need a crowbar to the face
ShitRedditSays,removed,they only understand the punchy punchy
ShitRedditSays,removed,more troubling than the ku klux klan is the white moderate who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another mans freedom mlkjr in his letter from birmingham jail the problem with violent protest is that it becomes a lot harder to justify and a lot easier to malign if someone smashes a window during a peaceful protest they can be dismissed as agitators the age old plague of any cause but during a violent or just non nonviolent protest these people turn the whole crowd from protesters to rioters also one must consider the collateral of nonpacifist protest if we are protesting a clinic of sorts and start lobbing rocks when the police show up what is the policeman supposed to say when his son asks daddy how did you break your shoulder we want freedom by any means necessary we want justice by any means necessary we want equality by any means necessary yes but then one must ask at what cost
ShitRedditSays,removed,for comparison on one occasion i got hit in the balls from a pitch from a pitching machine set to mph the pain is less like period cramps and more like having a cyst on your fallopian tubes
ShitRedditSays,removed,the most significant reason why trump won is because of the radicalization of the left that is not to say that everyone who is on the left or leans left is a whack job but you cant ignore the behavior from a lot of people on the left any fair minded person would agree that assaults calling for the death of police officers vandalism and general chaos that has occurred over the past year has been way over the top and it really turned people off the real crazy thing is that there are legitimate arguments and concerns that people on the left have and they should be addressed all of those points were overshadowed by the insane behavior that has occurred both candidates were flawed this election cycle both have outstanding problems that were never really investigated to compleation again because priorities shifted toward activism rather than getting to the bottom of these things but this is where we are now donald trump is the president of the united states and will be for at least the next four years i am not saying that people shouldnt speak out about policies they disagree with or protest please have robust and fact based debate please protest if you feel the need to just do so in a civilized way regardless of your political beliefs we all want what is best for our country make your points honestly and back them up with facts if the facts are on your side and you articulate them in a clear logical and convincing way you will have an impact sure there are ideologs who just will not listen but there are far more rational people who care less about left vs right and care more about improving our nation
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh boy this sub condones violence against trump supporters edgy
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually the male body as ways of shutting that down to prevent them getting a woman pregnant
ShitRedditSays,removed,i could see it being literally impossible to perform sexually in that situation so im not too worried
ShitRedditSays,removed,its like he says its okay to judge a man on his height but not okay to judge the ability of a woman to keep a proper diet
ShitRedditSays,removed,because it doesnt men will always pay for some shit for women so it all balances out ofcourse we focus on the wage gaps which are alot more controlled than the typical car dealerships who can make a woman believe anything and pay alot more for repairs that are fictional versus a man who knows when a car dealership is bullshitting him thats a dollar difference already right there in some cases electronics same shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think he was referring to what is colloquially known as whiskey dick
ShitRedditSays,removed,every time i see a man with a child i pepper spray him and call the cops
ShitRedditSays,removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikicollaborationwiththeaxispowersduringworldwarii helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
ShitRedditSays,removed,seems like news to you but most scientists at least the ones who work for governments usually have contracts impeding their right to free speech sometimes its worded in a way that gives them an obligation to be honest towards the public but also to respect their government and hierarchy meaning that even if they are right or at least not breaking the law you can always find an excuse to fuck with their careers or lock them in a legal battle against government entities if they become inconvenient and thats in countries that dont outright jail or murder them
ShitRedditSays,removed,buuuuut im doing it wrong i know
ShitRedditSays,removed,u and ur invisible hand can frig off
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh i hate the stemlord circle jerk as much as any other film major but this isnt too srsy
ShitRedditSays,removed,probably a legit psychopath considering how much effort they put into it
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is this autism
ShitRedditSays,removed,yep go ahead and read the rest and youll be on your way to bulimia in no time
ShitRedditSays,removed,kinky
ShitRedditSays,removed,unrelated but i sit on my hand for minutes until its numb so it feels like someone else is doing things to me in reply to sertroop on unrelated but with my friends we used to put our arms together meeting at the fist and someone else would put their arms around the ones of the first person then the one with the arms inside would try as hard as he could to free himself by pushing to the sides against the outer arms this would last seconds the person would be released and would feel like his arms floated for a while at utc toragnarok wrote unrelated but i sit on my hand for minutes until its numb so it feels like someone else is doing things to me httpiimgurcomueqglafpng
ShitRedditSays,removed,well she got nice tits though so im not complaining
ShitRedditSays,removed,of course its white people what did you expect
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i totally mistake year olds for year olds on the reg secondly this also makes it likely that she was drunk and therefore also not consenting
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait he didnt ask for a nude what are you talking about
ShitRedditSays,removed,committing genocide against your own citizens doesnt really help boost productivity either they confiscated lots of private property from the jews thus gained free labour for the consentration camps thats pretty productive if you ask me
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre overestimating reddit most of them are
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think its pretty established racial stereotype that jews are attracted to money but making fun of that in this context is not cool
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought that stuff about americans sucking at geography was all a stereotype but wtf lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey you feminists liberal cunts lets hear about why batman should be a black woman fucking idiots every single person in here
ShitRedditSays,removed,notice how you said prominent actors most of the actors with degrees in fine arts dont live in hollywood and make millions
ShitRedditSays,removed,right but not ones that are iconic characters in an established series with a passionate fan base
ShitRedditSays,removed,consider wiping your old comments with a tool like this one
ShitRedditSays,removed,because i didnt buy the game niggers in space
ShitRedditSays,removed,listenandbelieve
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait are we really calling the most iconic picture from the end of wwii sexual assault
ShitRedditSays,removed,women couldnt be funny this sub sorta proves that
ShitRedditSays,removed,meanwhile transgenders are delusional snowflakes
ShitRedditSays,removed,meanwhile transgenders are delusional snowflakes
ShitRedditSays,removed,i call bullshit me and my friends they are real i swear once had a conversation on marry rich anyone who says that and is for real he is a shit person no matter the gender u dont know much abot srs but from this thread i see a lot of hate towards men because they are hypocrits because of two comments from some dumbasses all men are the same is hurtful to men as all woman are the same sorry for my grammar i am tired and english is not my main language
ShitRedditSays,removed,just a genuine question its ok for people to hate fascists and nazis outright without having any deep knowledge of the ideology or having read mussolinis works or mein kampf just knowing the repressive notion of those ideologies their disregard for personal liberties freedom of speech womens rights the rights of minorities and general dissaproval of liberalism and liberal democracy is enough but when the same attitude is expressed towards islam arguable an ideology with almost identical approach towards the above you suddenly need to be an expert on the quran otherwise you know nothing about it and are racist sure many are just racist but isnt generalizing everyone who oppose the ideology of islam actually in a way defending a clearly oppressive illiberal and pretty much protofascist ideology which ends up being a huge irony when coming from the liberal side which ought to oppose the tennants of islam the most
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey reddit fascist people are fellow human beings just a friendly reminder that they are not what fear mongering folks want you to believe would i ever hear that from you
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop dehumanizing they are human beings fucking stop with this nazi mindset reddit fucking stop its extremely dangerous
ShitRedditSays,removed,rare occasion lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,more so thats the only side of tumblr that redditors are exposed to racist tumblr users dont make the rounds in the media the way the sjwtype crowd does
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh shit a game with millions of players houses a wide variety of people
ShitRedditSays,removed,brigade like what op is doing to the guy who wrote the comment regardless op should just report and move on instead of brigading the comment op is also being overdramatic because of a few comments relative to the number of people following the sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes like the girl who claimed some lady yelled at her in the bathroom for having short hair she gave a speech on social media using sjw language thats just the most recent one i remember
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets also conveniently ignore the fact that the only part of her body besides the head outside of her clothes the neck is very thin suggesting that the plumpness comes from the thick fur clothing its not like she needs warm clothes right
ShitRedditSays,removed,she looks big because she wears a very httpiimgurcomqikpunejpg she isnt nearly as big as she looks in the
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,executing nazis is always morally justifiable
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe its because the speech of these people is not under legal threat
ShitRedditSays,removed,liberland sounds like the shittiest theme park imaginable
ShitRedditSays,removed,fash are for bashing
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a washingtonian i will say i am pretty fucking pissed about the vandalism why fuck up my city what purpose does that serve and as someone who is antitrump protesting his rallies at the march today etc im also pretty fucking pissed about the vandalism grow the fuck up seriously how selfish can out get white privilege under a different banner in my opinion
ShitRedditSays,removed,horseshoe does apply here to a degree
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a fat person with a vagina who has read andrea dworkins insightful treatises i would just like to say cis males need to die
ShitRedditSays,removed,pol pot mao north korea i wouldnt say the majority
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank god you delusional morons have been outrageous in your antiscience fantasies maga
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i have seen it today lots of hysteria end of world behaviour he is there for years give it a month or and it will all calm down
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope you still voted for her
ShitRedditSays,removed,everything women have right now is due to men men created this peaceful western society where women can sit in and cry about the most inane shit men carry the burdens of society so women can cry so yes that march couldnt have happened without the permission of men
ShitRedditSays,removed,who would have built all the cities in which all the marches took place
ShitRedditSays,removed,only weak men suck up to women to get laid
ShitRedditSays,removed,white people are oppressed
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol my grandparents had to flee india because it was unsafe for muslims
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is rindia being linked here
ShitRedditSays,removed,the comment author is nonwhite
ShitRedditSays,removed,did they go be whiny motherfuckers in dc tho i wonder whos more upset its you
ShitRedditSays,removed,im glad ive seen mostly positive reactions even here on reddit as much hate flinging as there is on some boards most people seem to either agree or be able to respect truly non violent protests even if they dont agree
ShitRedditSays,removed,yese
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know all the history all i know is my grandparents moved to pakistan to flee violence against muslims in amritsar
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah they are punjabi and no worries it didnt come across that way
ShitRedditSays,removed,the op is indian though
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont worry im sure the women got a participation trophy even if they achieved fuck all
ShitRedditSays,removed,ever consider theres a reason women dont like you kid
ShitRedditSays,removed,watchmojocom top genders
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is meirl not shit crazy that people move subs when they get banned for nonsense like using the word bitch
ShitRedditSays,removed,he said in srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh if its his opinion its fine experiences facts and statistics cant be racist but how you gather them and how you interpret them can be
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck those who glorify violence yeah and kill all the white men this but unironically
ShitRedditSays,removed,does that count as creeping he took a photo of a tshirt not of any part of her body that can be sexualized if the person was a guy would it still be creeping
ShitRedditSays,removed,huh if you put it that way it makes sense but seeing it from a different angle it is supposed to be humour albeit a bit shitty so whats the line between humour and being a creepassholeracisthomophobe im kind of new to srs and i dont always agree with the opinions on here since the offendingracistetc comments are usually humour i could say a racist joke but that doesnt mean i am racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow this sub sucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,the kittens arent fucking wtf theyre just retarded
ShitRedditSays,removed,please tell me you are just poking fun with that statement and are not serious
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is nothing virtuous about getting mad about words on the internet thats just pettiness
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realise you are a redditor
ShitRedditSays,removed,glad to know there are some of you that understand the ridiculousness of it i at least hope you are joking back at me with that
ShitRedditSays,removed,man you should post yourself in that furthest removed from reality askreddit thread because you win
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh redditors probably do have caveman brains
ShitRedditSays,removed,the picutre that was deleted for referns httpimgurcompxhrqrj
ShitRedditSays,removed,so the middleeast
ShitRedditSays,removed,ew
ShitRedditSays,removed,slow day huh
ShitRedditSays,removed,talking out of your arse there mate
ShitRedditSays,removed,sexist let me post it on rshitleftiessays
ShitRedditSays,removed,hang all pedophiles
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks for not checking the context but still enlightening us with a wrong opinion
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand the comment didnt say anything about the kids race sex or religious beliefs just that the kid couldnt hack it which he count evidence of that being that he jumped non of that is any where near bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,except he was weak boot camp hits everybody different and the article states that the recruit jumped after waking up from passing out on the drill field immediately running and jumping he just couldnt hack it suicide attempts are nothing new for boot camp and usually med guys catch it fast they let this guy go back into training after threatning suicide on the first day so this guy was weak from the get go the fault was transferd to whoever let me resume training after threatening suicide
ShitRedditSays,removed,you deleted that post pussy fuck off boot
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre all pussies
ShitRedditSays,removed,mind linking me to where they implied that what the rapist did was ok and not just saying she had a bad idea
ShitRedditSays,removed,brdbrdbrdbrdbrdbrd
ShitRedditSays,removed,my experience says it didnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,an alternate term for that which is making its way around reddit is called a chad meaning a stereotypical frat bro ive used the term basic to refer to women and men but women get more of it because while my evidence is anecdotal ive never seen more of a uniform than a group of year olds on a college campus than with basic girls even some guy groups dont have the same version of similar than yoga pants uggs and a north face im not against it i dont care at all just find it interesting
ShitRedditSays,removed,ban me from your shit sub please
ShitRedditSays,removed,exactly the reason hillary lost elections thanks for helping trump win please do not change at all i want him to win in too
ShitRedditSays,removed,well if you stopped showing the great depression people starving to death people as they died from holocaustno they didnt they died from starvation just like germans then it would be more believable sorry but if you knew the history only a little bit you would know that not enough evidence has been gathered to prove holocaust yet
ShitRedditSays,removed,the london science museum and london zoo previously had policies prohibiting adult males from accompanying girls on sleepover events adult women were allowed to accompany boys though thanks to campaigns by mras but they existed for a while and were based on stereotypes about men being sexual predators several airlines used to have policies that adult men were not able to sit next to children that werent there own if this happened the man was told he had to switch seats with a woman and there have been many news stories of men being harassed or having the police called just for being men in the proximity of children you should leave your bubble some time and learn about how the world works
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you kidding me srs this is a fucking quote from the italian job
ShitRedditSays,removed,because those two groups contain exclusively the exact same people give me a break
ShitRedditSays,removed,and this is why you lost the election
ShitRedditSays,removed,like i know hes overeacting but men being misstrusted this way is a thing and no its not because they act suspicious what do you even base that on
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi i made that comment care to explain whats wrong with my reasoning i believe that the racist bigots who supported trump were delighted when a man who speaks his mind came to the fore they felt they were justified in their reasonings they felt they were right branding trump as a racist sexist bogot and labeling his supporters the same isolated them i think ignoring their ridiculous campaign kept them in a bubble that resulted in their growth and the eventual election of their figure they were right and they slapped each other on the back reaffirming this i think its mine and your duty to confront bigots entering discussion with them so that they and we have a chance to see their not always right casting them off only reinforces their ideology
ShitRedditSays,removed,well hes right that they need to be confronted preferably with the business end of a firearm
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think the counselor was saying that everyone who says theyre fine is not more that people often interpret it that way which is true
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds like a plan
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why castration was invented
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are not pineapples
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are not pineapples
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are not pineapples
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are not pineapples
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,redditors are not cnts they lack warmth and depth
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is it okay to hit someone with your car on purpose when they surround your vehicle and threaten you that is when it is literally okay legally and ethically to hit people with your car there arent many other instances where this is the case
ShitRedditSays,removed,id like to see what happens if it was reversed the cars protest and block the sidewalks
ShitRedditSays,removed,perceived according to the us national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes almost all men are stronger than almost all women based on combined grip strength the fact that almost all women are weaker than almost all men is the precise reason why female cops shoot more suspects than male cops they are not physically threatening because almost every male knows he can overpower her if cornered so they have to resort to shooting way more often men basically do those kinds of jobs out of necessity considering the average contributes a net loss in taxes over the course of her lifetime the least you could do is show some respect that is according this study done of new zealand households
ShitRedditSays,removed,clearly a tiny person can subdue criminals just as well as a huge person there is literally no physical advantage to being larger even though the laws of physics disagree with me clearly the poster was evil and bigoted for suggesting that the laws of physics apply to police officers
ShitRedditSays,removed,i troll them almost as hard as i troll sjws try reading more than the sub titles next time lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,menslib is a real mrm organization that isnt shit op is probably not referring to menslib
ShitRedditSays,removed,ugh this is why you hate jokes youre terrible at them pick a more offensive stereotype white guy school shooter is played out for example associate white people with bestiality
ShitRedditSays,removed,wellthere certainly are cases where men are discriminated and their rights need to be fought for its just that people who do activism for this generally stick to one thing so there are groups supporting fathers supporting male rape victims etc there never was a need for group thats covers all the issues the way feminism does since areas where mens issues do exist are exceptions from their overall position mras mostly seem like using the issues as excuse for trolling instead of actually trying to help other men
ShitRedditSays,removed,let me rephrase its a movement for mens rights that is legitimately about mens rights
ShitRedditSays,removed,rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,the actors happen to be black you fucking mouthbreathers
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair the skin colour has no relevance in the comic
ShitRedditSays,removed,ummno in case of parental rights the laws are supposed to be equal the discrimination comes almost exclusiviely from bias of judges which are mostly women in this type of courts and pleaselets not pretent feminism is fighting for actual equality of genders theyre fighting for women rights and thats noble but every we also fight for men argument is just dishonest mental gymnastics aimed solely at killing any competition while doing nothing
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought socialliberalism was all about equality for everyone am i wrong about that
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs is a trash subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs is a trash subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,be careful ukewlbuttz the jews also control reddit if they catch you they will brainwash you to be a gay satanist who likes hiphop music wake up sheeple
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you so much for the recognition its a lot of hard work being such a righteous bad ass and its nice to see its finally starting to pay off for me god bless
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre not making any sense perhaps your parents should have you checked for autism pm me and ill be happy to provide a list of clinics in your area that you can get tested at keep your chin up sport
ShitRedditSays,removed,or its a reference to the five burglars initially arrested in the watergate scandal
ShitRedditSays,removed,which changes
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh i get it shes a girl and is probably a massive slut right guys haha i bet she likes cocks fingers get more sweaty as he types
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people who do you mean gators im definitely not that but whats more likely a nintendo game has a reference to a piece of infamous controversial internet drama or a nintendo game has a reference to a famous american political scandal with an additional obscure reference to me the latter seems far more likely
ShitRedditSays,removed,its even more stupid the guy didnt even give her game a good review he mentioned it in an article about indie games to check out
ShitRedditSays,removed,from what ive been reading these screenshots are from portions of the game that are separated by a lot of gameplay they literally do not occur in tandem its only by taking the two screenshots and putting them together that makes it seem like its part of the same scene
ShitRedditSays,removed,totally agree i constantly get told off for wearing dreadlocks and my tupac tshirt just because im white like you said i should be able to dress how i want
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeh because this comic seems to paint itself in a real world when superman did that he got a lot of hate
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol ok way to be a cunt
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you let anyone in the chances that some fucked up stranger sticking two fingers in is pretty high i think she knew that this could happen im pretty sure its completely expected when you invite a bunch of strangers to come touch your junk in reply to papajee on damn at the end one guy went two fingers deep immediately at utc ringelreddit wrote if you let anyone in the chances that some fucked up stranger sticking two fingers in is pretty high i think she knew that this could happen
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit still doesnt understand the concept of consent more at
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit understands consent like a year old understands quantum physics
ShitRedditSays,removed,gotta love that its the womens fault even though its a performance art which showed that some guys would seriously not hesitate for one moment to do that
ShitRedditSays,removed,rthathappened also she wants the d
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbf and correct me if im wrong but it looks like she didnt mind or at the very least knew that people were going to do that if she did she wouldnt have done it three separate times in three separate cities so she was doing it when it was completely expected theres so much more itt to be upset about
ShitRedditSays,removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha this place is a shit hole
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,im glad you cleared up whether its funny or not ill make sure to note it down in the book of truths
ShitRedditSays,removed,cool story bro
ShitRedditSays,removed,openly admitting brigading again cool
ShitRedditSays,removed,but they were mocking people who think like that how is that disturbing
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats true tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,u r stronger than me
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does it work
ShitRedditSays,removed,hell ya sistah
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol ya sistah
ShitRedditSays,removed,peaked sistah
ShitRedditSays,removed,tell em sistah did you look
ShitRedditSays,removed,were you given leave to speak you worthless illegal crawl back to your little friends where you belong
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh ffs reddit they should all be castrated with a chainsaw
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think something is mentally wrong with white folks its unnatural
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes it was very nice very modern and well overall clean however i once saw a kid jumping around in his own piss but hey i am sure it was promptly cleaned up afterwards i also lived in guangzhou and the subway there was also very nice modern and clean i dont recall any issues with bo in either
ShitRedditSays,removed,ugh a cis man what have cis men ever accomplished
ShitRedditSays,removed,unjerk im a chinese person myself and let me tell you that the dirty chinese that most of these people refer to is not the people in beijing but the people from mainland china who were most heavily affected by maos reign and lost many cultural values and practices many of these mainlander chinese lost thousand year old mannerisms and it can be seen today in the last generation of people who lived through mao there are some chinese that are straight up disgusting but it isnt their fault rejerk youre on a subway deal with it you racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,always finding a method to look down on others as expected
ShitRedditSays,removed,true though
ShitRedditSays,removed,my unpopular reddit opinion is that women coloreds and trannies are just whiny its so hard being a white man unpopular
ShitRedditSays,removed,i need some encouragement guys im coming out to my parents ive always felt like im trapped in a body thats not mine like my soul was snatched from my body and trapped into someone elses thats why ive wanted to come out to you as an abrams tank i really dont know how my fundie parents are going to react to this
ShitRedditSays,removed,in what fucking world does mma ability to win a fight equate to being able to lift more than her fucking dipshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think men cumming inside you weekly is enough for any noticeable effects
ShitRedditSays,removed,its silly to say that everything is normal it isnt but it is ok its just fine for a transgender to not only feel that way but to also pursue a body appearance to match its fine but something isnt normal thats very clear do you not find that sensible in the slightest
ShitRedditSays,removed,very well said op
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the user seemed to be making fun of all lives matter which im cool with
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the good thing the woman wasnt driving comment makes a lot of sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,so on average people that work longer hours take less vacations and work harder jobs earn more money thats shocking
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you trying to be a exist or autistic
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit is progressive
ShitRedditSays,removed,racial joke triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a black woman he lied even if his anecdote is true black people dont even tip other black people well black people view tipping the same way foreigners do sure you might get a few who go against the grain but its very much true
ShitRedditSays,removed,awww i missed the little white boy what did he say
ShitRedditSays,removed,why not
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair if i woke up in the morning and had literally turned black i would be seeking immediate medical attention
ShitRedditSays,removed,does that apply to both images
ShitRedditSays,removed,nothat was base off a moive character fun fact a lot of girl are like that before you get all pissy im a girl and i play dnd
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is my new account still cant believe you banned me
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a month old
ShitRedditSays,removed,we have a rule here that post have to have upvotes
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know how dare people look at her body after she willingly posed in the magazine espn the body issue along side male athletes that are also nude this is definitely proof of the patriarchy sjw attack
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats mean but its still a month old
ShitRedditSays,removed,thought id jump in to provide some context for the argument i dont frequent here at all disclaimer how the fuck does sleeping around increase crime rates this is a heavy oversimplification of the issue the issue is that the extremely high wedlock rate in black communities leads to a larger number of singleparent households with mothers usually dealing with the kids its been proven time and time again through every race that a fatherless home will tend to develop more violent hypermasculine and uncontrollable boys as they have no male figure to look up to in their daily lives this inevitably leads to more focus on the basic things like sex and entertainment and less on things like career prospects the sleeping around doesnt increase crime rates its the extremely high number of hit and run instances that leave so many boys fatherless contributing to a hypermasculine and uncontrollable culture among young blacks similar things happen in poor fatherless white households however these are much less common and therefore higher rates of crime so its more of the indirect effect of the sleeping around more than just sleeping around black fathers are also the most likely be involved with their kids this may be completely true but black households still have an alarmingly high singleparent household rate black fathers that live with their kids may very well spend more time with them than other families but theyre also in a much much smaller minority than fathers of other races that stuck around the argument of slavery and such is a topic for another time but i figured id include that its not as much as an effect as i originally though i can share what ive seen but only if youd be interested hopefully this helped clear some stuff up its a topic i enjoy talking about but dont really get the chance to discuss often
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is no extremely high number of out of wedlock children heres a politifact to address that using fbi data more importantly it implies that single mothers are incapable of raising a child it also goes into gay couples in which there are two fathers or two mothers and for you to be correct would mean gay people are also incapable of raising children i didnt mean to imply that if thats what youre getting from it i said that boys raised without fathers tend to develop more unpredictable violent and prone to urges this would not be an issue when a boy has two fathers the key factor here is a masculine figure i cant speak to girls growing up without mothers but i would assume fathers would be less capable with them just as mothers are less capable with sons heres a collection of some stats regarding fatherless homes to back it up httpwwwfatherscomstatisticsandresearchtheconsequencesoffatherlessness a single parent household has nothing to do with parent involvement as i showed with my statistics black fathers spend more time with their kids than white fathers including out of wedlock and single parent households yes your statistic showed that black fathers are more likely to spend time with their kids not that numberstonumbers more black fathers are spending time with their kids and what i mean by this is that you can have black fathers and white fathers if you have of black fathers spending time with their kids and of white fathers spending time with their kids you can definitely say black fathers are more likely to do so but that doesnt mean that there are just as many fathers for both demographics all it means is that a black father is more likely to spend time with his kids it doesnt address the far lower frequency of black fathers actually living with their families unless you can provide evidence which shows having a single mother creates violent behavior in children then there is no argument to be made again not exactly what i said it isnt the mothers fault the kids grow up this way its the lack of a father that does this ive provided substantial evidence at this point that a fatherless home does indeed create rather large issues nonracespecific i definitely think there is an argument to be made though
ShitRedditSays,removed,this nude picture was posted to reddit months ago and was top post i dont think theres anything wrong with this picture at all its very classy and was taken with the subjects permission can someone explain why this is so upsetting
ShitRedditSays,removed,not having a father doesnt make a child hypermasculine again you need to provide a source for these very extreme claims im pretty sure there is a least one academic source that completely proves you wrong and here it is unbiased and from canada so you know enjoy
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpprospectorgarticleconsequencessinglemotherhood you posted your article about how black fathers spend the most time with their kids thats fantastic but these are about why being a single parent is bad this is not directed towards any particular race it just specifies how kids raised in single parent homes are at a disadvantage now i live in a city where there are really really bad areas with lots of kids living in single parent homes with their parents working either incredibly hard and long hours or they are just completely absent all together leading the child to seek out other alternatives usually associating with bad people ive seen a generation of kids grow up hit obtain firearms and shoot each other shit some of them dont even wait until they are and then i hear stories about a year old girl in a bad part of town getting hit by a ricochet and dying because some kids wearing different color bandanas are going at it do you think any of this is okay the whole system needs an overhaul to remove inequity but at the same time there are also other changes that can be made on the other end
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is no extremely high number of out of wedlock children from a huffington post article detailing the same material you posted
ShitRedditSays,removed,people are referring to this i have no antiwhatever agenda that link is from an article commending black fathers for being more present than other racial counterparts found however these are actual problems our country is facing ive posted a lot of other material in this thread detailing why its a problem using a nonracial bias so please read before writing others off as racist for saying something you dont like
ShitRedditSays,removed,alanis
ShitRedditSays,removed,omg i cant believe he said that lolz
ShitRedditSays,removed,in the way that the sub is satirical
ShitRedditSays,removed,because its a degree with little market value youre contributing to the wage gap by taking such a cop out degree
ShitRedditSays,removed,hp has published a lot of articles calling out businesses for lack of diveristy as well as preaching the need for diversity in tech and many government areas that pic shows a sad case of do as we say not as we do great deal of hyprocity in that one picture
ShitRedditSays,removed,communism capitalism sorry but are they related to this
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub needs to be nuked from orbit brigading little shits
ShitRedditSays,removed,idc
ShitRedditSays,removed,vous beaucoup va vraiment obtenir offensé par quoi que ce soit
ShitRedditSays,removed,idc just report n ban me already
ShitRedditSays,removed,well the nig thing ruins knight which is a pretty common name
ShitRedditSays,removed,still cant tell if satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,this
ShitRedditSays,removed,really i havent seen any examples of that i have however seen the complete opposite of that with all male environments being criticized and all female ones getting praise maybe you misunderstood what i said
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,except it was in reply to a sarcastic post
ShitRedditSays,removed,erm isnt this very obviously a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,not sure what it was in reply to tbh but i assumed it was the guy that said men have it the worst and someone below said i think they missed your s on mobile
ShitRedditSays,removed,muh holocaust
ShitRedditSays,removed,the confederate army was full of whores racists and shitbags
ShitRedditSays,removed,poor little delicate korean boys it just tells you how naive and mentally weak these sods are i found these two pictures theyre from hong dae httpiimgurcomxnhlchbpng its hilarious how offended and butthurt korean boys get when women are just simply highlighting the toxic sexist misogynistic culture in this country mentally fragile korean boys are taking in all these like as if women are saying all korean men are rapists lol you have to understand that these boys are in shock like for once women who have been oppressed by this society and culture to act pure and virginal submissive and passive are standing up for themselves and actually fucking talking about the issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,that dude is triggered as fuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,i noticed you avoided pronouns is it a boy or a girl even you cant tell
ShitRedditSays,removed,we dont give a fuck about fake internet points
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre not wrong youre just an idiot and racist for thinking diversity is bad for white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,much like after every islamic terrorist attack muslims and liberals flood social media with not all muslims but somehow thats an okay thing to do
ShitRedditSays,removed,the reason why fetishes are put beyond criticism is because liberals have argued that homosexuality is okay because they cant help it having fetishes is largely out of ones control so people have adopted that defense for homosexuality for all fetishes even incredibly dangerous ones like pedophilia its disgusting and based on a false idea anyway fetishes and sexuality can be altered to an extent those with harmful fetishes should be taken into therapy if they cannot change then suppression and imprisonment is the only ethical choice
ShitRedditSays,removed,hah thats nothing you should see this subreddit rshitredditsays they brigade everyone who disagrees with them and spend all day circlejerking in their echo chambers
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was an eternal fight for those looking to end slavery too
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think thats the opinion of two different people
ShitRedditSays,removed,the what
ShitRedditSays,removed,trump won because a guy is masturbating to pics of his daughter
ShitRedditSays,removed,freeze frame yep thats me now i know what youre thinking how did you get to that point in your life well it all started when i discovered what hentai was
ShitRedditSays,removed,you want a revolution donate to the clinton foundation theyll have their israeli and european friends bankroll the revolution and their saudi friends will provide the jihadists i mean protesters to fight it for you all transactions will be done a private server so you dont have to worry about getting caught disclaimer only success rate libya syria may result in offshoot extremist terrorist groups and millions of refugees
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you actually just assume their identity
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh so you can judge fuck off why is homosexuality okay but incest not if both participants are willing and there is no coercion
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you know he was white
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh okay totally not racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,nsfw help remind me of the usual fate of fascists
ShitRedditSays,removed,how can you support womens rights yet still hold islam in a positive light mental gymnastics overload
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait whats bad about this
ShitRedditSays,removed,its coming to terms of the reality that youre an adult
ShitRedditSays,removed,and even funnier when hillary was awarded more delegates in states during the primary despite losing to bernie in those states muh majority vote only matters when its not in my favor montana rhode island wyoming indiana and michigan
ShitRedditSays,removed,doesnt the term alt right literally do the opposite of this id imagine so assuming left is still the opposite of right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wonder if she knows this is how he feels about her
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the original drop the soap joke was actually because the person was just washing them selves and dropped the soap by accident causing them to bend over thus giving the opportunity for them to be raped not because people use soap as lube this guy is justidk
ShitRedditSays,removed,but thats funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe this guy should consider booking a surgery
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is an old chris rock bit
ShitRedditSays,removed,im in a relationship with someone who is post op but that doesnt matter at all you want to swap your gendersex id go for it hope his girlfriend cuts his dick off
ShitRedditSays,removed,not trying to defend these guys but the thread is suppose to be a roast of the teamfans these guys obviously dont believe this stuff
ShitRedditSays,removed,aha this is cathartic to read
ShitRedditSays,removed,inclined to agree
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not a gun nut but would definitely mow down a golliwog if they blocked a highway are great lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey thanks for the shoutout im glad people are agreeing with me but i would prefer this link get remove i have been getting a lot of hate mail from trolls and stuff reading through this sub i appreciate what you guys are doing but i use this siteaccount mainly for my hobbies i used to be a regular user of this sub on an alt account but i ended up arguing with lists of people and it wasnt great for my mental state i just got a bit mad and called someone out thank you
ShitRedditSays,removed,there should be racists in canada we kept the niggers here and you got your rep of being a nice country thats over with
ShitRedditSays,removed,i actually agree with this guy if someone is on the freeway where youre supposed to be going like sixty miles an hour if not faster and someone is blocking it someone is literally walking on the freeway then what the hell you thinking youre going to get run over
ShitRedditSays,removed,people who block highways prevent emergency services from being able to do their jobs now who doesnt give a fuck about peoples lives
ShitRedditSays,removed,good white male pick one
ShitRedditSays,removed,anyone notice how the alt left wines about everything without really getting anything accomplished i mean who takes emotions and argues against facts
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty sure its fair game thanks again for proving my point
ShitRedditSays,removed,really comic book nerds those are the worst individuals not nazis or serial killers not terrorists comic book nerds who i have to say before you generalize come in multiple colors the dudebro section is awful but even they most of the time arent murderers some of us are quite happy about he new changes being made
ShitRedditSays,removed,its annoying yes its clearly an exaggeration but its not especially clever and im not sure what sense of humor finds it funny its still a massive generalization about a large group with a small annoying vocal minority why not say these douchebags are the worst people ever or even better those fans are the worst people ever i would have skipped right over that comic but when people are dicks and make blanket statements the size of football fields i feel the need to point it out
ShitRedditSays,removed,honkey is our word our word
ShitRedditSays,removed,im basically against shooting police officers in cold blood in acts of terrorism but i totally understand why rioters turn violent theres only so much police brutality you can endure before striking back violence in selfdefence is quite understandable and basically inevitable
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah how about no you made my point yourself your not funny its not clever you just use it as an excuse to be a dick
ShitRedditSays,removed,by the way bolded text your so edgy its impressive at least it wasnt in all caps
ShitRedditSays,removed,why i like this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah the point wasnt that white males are oppressed and i dont think white males have lost much privilege if any although sounds like you disagree its that people have a green light to say shitty and unfair things about them this isnt an erosion of power its just individuals being mean without purpose you dont achieve social justice by tearing other people down and if you approach it that way itll take a longer time for society to improve
ShitRedditSays,removed,im the op im not a victim i just think society should not be accepting of people who are shitty to others based on their racegender
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey look its me im the op i had to use an alt because i see you guys hide comments from ops but ill be nice i promise i dont think being a white male is socially unacceptable and i dont think white males are victims i think that saying shitty and unfair things about white males has become more socially acceptable and its not about egalitarianism i never used that word you did i believe in improving the conditions for disadvantaged groups but having a society where its acceptable to be shitty and unfair to white males does not achieve that one way to help see that is to look for white males in society who are less privileged than you and consider the fact that when you talk about white males you are talking directly to them as well for example a mentally ill homeless white male
ShitRedditSays,removed,not to be malicious at all but i reported this comment bc snotfan asked that it be removedaltered a while ago and you didnt respond to a u summon id prefer he not take any abuse bc of something he was only a part of in passing and he did ask nicely
ShitRedditSays,removed,good white males exist wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,please stop being crime factories minorities
ShitRedditSays,removed,neuter all straight men
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly i do the same but theres a line and this just crossed it yeah tasteless jokes are kind of what a roast is supposed to be about and id let it slide for the other jokes in this thread but when youre effectively laughing over a guy who got murdered by the police just went too far theres a reason that too soon exists even though its cliché at this point
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive yet to see a street with mlks name on it that would prove this quote wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,how can you seriously think someone can be more equal than another equal is an absolute it means exactly the same
ShitRedditSays,removed,i feel for people who have a disgusting floppy meat tendril between their legs
ShitRedditSays,removed,male culture you mean culture all culture is male culture
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you just assume my
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are times better
ShitRedditSays,removed,no thats actually quite accurate with a lot of things ive seen on tumblr just by existing as a nonminority in whatever capacity youre oppressing somebody in some way
ShitRedditSays,removed,its an analogy i come to this subreddit to enjoy stupid shit americans say not see people fail to grasp simple concepts
ShitRedditSays,removed,your fat shocking
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sure i mean you did laugh at his joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,i feel like it needs to be bolded when it was clearly missed in the first comment that got to for saying that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet youre fun at parties
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i laughed sure its a horrible thing to say still funny though
ShitRedditSays,removed,its hillarious ahahahaha
ShitRedditSays,removed,only a skinny white boy would find this funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,people against social justice are literal trash and should be curb stomped in the street like the shit they are ◡‿◡✿ be sure to arm yourself so that if you are attacked or you see these fucks on the street you can do your part in making society better ◡‿◡✿ unless you feel like hurting yourself then you should practice self care and wait until you feel better dont worry you are strong and worthy even if you never do feel better ◡‿◡✿ also subscribers we did it brdz
ShitRedditSays,removed,bruh come on yo the subreddit is literally rjokes how can you get mad at s fucking joke its supposed to be offensive just dont look at it this is the internet
ShitRedditSays,removed,how many of you guys have watched friends that line from the show how you doin is the character joeys pickup line and its supposed to work wonders as a running gag in the show those redditors are just perpetuating that gag not saying that just because she laughed she wants to fuck him jesus christ you people are far too sensitive and culturally ignorance
ShitRedditSays,removed,blehhh sooo disgusting wow so who actually got raped it was a joke on reddit and you guys are acting like you saw a dog get hit my a semi truck you all need to chill and stop getting so offended by the mildest of offensive jokes sincerely sexually molested fat guy
ShitRedditSays,removed,highly jealous of rsoccer and our superiority its natural to be
ShitRedditSays,removed,oppurtunities shouldnt just be given out to a person because they are born a certain color they should be given out to everyone by the same standards what was that mlk said about judging people by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin
ShitRedditSays,removed,but it doesnt even help all people of color an asian person is less likely to be accepted into a college than a black person with the exact same sat scores and gpa its wrong also i fail to see how i cherry picked what mlk said
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are missing the point this isnt just some joke this is his flirty pick up line from the show if it were just a normal joke then this persons comment would be way more inappropriate
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyones a fan of vaporizing fascists
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was probably a false flag done by the government we really need a site to start coralling all this stuff we could call it like databattlescom
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a white guy i find this offensive
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you dont care
ShitRedditSays,removed,so do you have an angry opposition to racial generalizations except those directed at whites it sure sounds like it you generalized how a cracker would say something thats offensive and on top of that cracker is a slur am i really offended nah but get your head out of your ass racism towards whites isnt treated seriously in this community
ShitRedditSays,removed,gotta throw in some derogatory terms for good measure literally no better than the guy from the post
ShitRedditSays,removed,mind if i ask you your race
ShitRedditSays,removed,its largely agreed that the suffering comes from societal and external forces you know what thats not true if it was transition wouldnt be the recommended course of action by just about every legitimate modern medical source in the world transition is a requirement for trans people it doesnt matter how nice people are if a trans person cant get the medication andor surgery that they need they will suffer period and that doesnt mean that all trans people need the same medical treatment or the same extent of treatment but the reality is transition is not a choice it is a real immediate medical need it has been proven by every expert to be essential to trans peoples survival stop saying that the medical needs of transgender people dont exist stop reducing the medical needs of transgender people to a cosmetic choice stop it you are hurting us you are part of the problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not so much bullshit as it is just unbridled mental illness
ShitRedditSays,removed,what was the kids answer
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol how uptight do you have to be to not think that is at least a little bit funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think theres a pretty big difference between violent protest and escalation on paper escalating means doing worse than what was previously done eg attacking two white people for being white because one white person attacked a minority for being a minority i understand the need for violent protest against those who commit violent acts but not escalation escalation gets innocent people in the crossfire if the initial act is against innocents an escalation that act means only that more innocents will be hurt and im not really okay with that
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh my god i didnt realize what this sub was until now you are all regressive leftists fuck your silly safe space bye 👋 its just a word people intent vs content
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont get it
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt whoosh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i saw that video too op
ShitRedditSays,removed,umbut it kinda is
ShitRedditSays,removed,the point wasnt that there isnt enough white people in the movie its that the tweet was saying the cast is hella diverse when there was of the cast is african or african americans
ShitRedditSays,removed,those people are so white that even their i have african friends is white or maybe what they said was right i know two africans guess what theyre both white africa doesnt consist entirely of black people and well yes i guess to people surrounded by that reality diversity must equate to nonwhite this reference was to the twitter post which clearly did mean nonwhite by their use of the term diversity
ShitRedditSays,removed,who is the girl youre correct i dont have the right to decide how this impacted her as an observer so im not going to call it rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,feel free to change my title
ShitRedditSays,removed,no i dont im ready to get banned im sorry for causing you to be literally shaking with my racist sentences above
ShitRedditSays,removed,rapes someone you just got pranked in reply to turdmogrol on rape is trolling at utc wrote rapes someone you just got pranked httpiimgurcombrhcdlypng
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope theyre being sarcastic to mock this mindset i mean it is comedy cemetery where of reddit belongs
ShitRedditSays,removed,in reddit dot cock one sjw speaks for everyone who dislikes oppression and discrimination based on ethnicity sexuality culture class or gender i mean this works for black men transsexuals etc as long as they say something stupid that reddit can either ridicule or something that allows them to justify their shit eating colonial century discriminating ways rasabrownman i believe that we shouldnt let any muslims into the glorious ancestral home of the white man america rasafemale i believe that women are illogical and stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,thedonald fucks with him on a regular basis so
ShitRedditSays,removed,it isnt being aware of it existing but the fact he did it if he did it once then he will do it again i expect spez to be replaced by the end of the week i dont suppose you know rules or proper administration since you are just a srs mod p
ShitRedditSays,removed,funny how you subhumans will even stand up for pedophiles if the right is attacking them truly worthless scum make up this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,and deporting pocs while acdc pence runs up the electricity bill
ShitRedditSays,removed,shut up fag
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true fuck blm animals
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao its true though
ShitRedditSays,removed,kinda sounds like what blm says when you bring up black on black crime fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,waawaa we have to accommodate mentally ill genital mutilatirs
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly do it we run this site now go to your sjw cuck containment board
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have a question for all the sjws here dont worry i come in peace this is just a legitimate question with no ill intent im not trying to cause problems i listen to a lot of rap music and i rap along to it i say the n word a lot when i do this in the context of the song would you guys be offended by this usage btw im white actually im russian i hate the terms black and white because they say nothing about where youre actually from people assume that by white i probably am of irishscottish descent nope eastern european and i have the language and alcohol tolerance to prove it anyway this is just one trump supporters point of view please refrain from flaming me when you answer my question thank you
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a joke guys calm down
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe you should leave your parents basement
ShitRedditSays,removed,im going against the jerk a bit just because i think it depends on what they mean by that i always start with these people whichever group are people theyre just like me were all at bottom wanting the same things everyone wants to be treated fairly everyone wants a home and a family where they can live in peace thats why blm is in the streets why the native americans are protesting the pipeline they want to have what most of us have the right to expect our government to work for us political action requires collitions thats just how they work its better as far as getting things done to form a large block of voters i think its sometimes used as an excuse to not do anything which is where reddit seems to go this guy is a moron i just dont think the idea of finding common ground is always bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,amongst a sea of snark and vitriol this was a soothing comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a white guy i just want everything to stop being my fault
ShitRedditSays,removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree i dont think the guy was actually equivocating the two
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think op was being serious with the question i think he said it to point out what the poster did
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol everyone i know with a stem degree is doing extremely well i dont know what planet you live on but stem and trades will definitely get you a more profitable job stop trying to invent a stereotype that doesnt exist
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fuck did this guy seriously just make a joke holy shit someone call buzzfeed now this cannot be allowed to continue
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i mean like of people with schizophrenia commit suicide and thats definitely considered a mental disorder but somehow gender dysphoria is considered perfectly normal when half of sufferers or something like that i dont know the actual statistics commit suicide also any other time someone has delusions that theyre something other than what they are theyd be considered disordered but a guy thinking theyre a girl or vice versa is somehow perfectly healthy it literally fits the dictionary definition of a mental disorder you people are just unbelievable
ShitRedditSays,removed,dating not fucking
ShitRedditSays,removed,could you not spam racism everywhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,lel well im enjoying my salary fresh out of college as a cs grad with a gpa
ShitRedditSays,removed,propogating racism while striving for equality seems a bit hypocritical
ShitRedditSays,removed,and liberal arts and humanities arent saturated
ShitRedditSays,removed,as an attention seeking person myself ftfu
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont see anyone on that thread implying that and i dont see anybody attacking you
ShitRedditSays,removed,um you were called a social reject but if what the others say is true i dont really understand why this belongs here were both on the spectrum but i wouldnt dream of looking like im harassing someone
ShitRedditSays,removed,isil sells people into fucking slavery how is that the same as protesting brutality
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are outraged by this youre ridiculous accusation does not equal guilty
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont forget rule you can not engage in an intellectual discussion by disagreeing
ShitRedditSays,removed,rshitshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i thought it was funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i did did you i thought this sub was against bigotry and racism which is precisely why i called you out
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you going to tell me it is something along the lines of discrimination based on the color of ones skin coupled with institutional authority
ShitRedditSays,removed,because you dont debate fascists you bash them
ShitRedditSays,removed,im pretty confident that trump was elected because he was on the republican ticket republicans regularly turn up to vote for their candidate but democrats dont without a reason so hillary lost even if it were true that trumps supporters were somehow emboldened to elect a racist candidate by being told that their beliefs were racist there was plenty of discourse with these people which could go nowhere because their concerns tend to be irrational why waste time with free speech when most of it is harmful and wrong we could be doing something exciting instead
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol thats awesome im so happy when i see people getting run over for standing in the street its like instant karma videos or when girls get knocked out after beating on a dude the fuck you think is gonna happen lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,never realised jeff was a redditor
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs is speaking in my native tongue these days 💕 the best discourse to have with neonazis is a swift kick to the teeth
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know its a cliché observation but what are the odds that pence is deep in the closet that man is too suspiciously antilgbtqia
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a old copypasta lads
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this sub not banned for brigading
ShitRedditSays,removed,that story sounds fake tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,just like feminists
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre missing the point theyre getting outraged over whats clearly a propaganda piece the original article also has an anonymous source and is barely sentences while the dailymail rendition goes into a tangent about isis
ShitRedditSays,removed,definitely
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think thats fair to say sure the community is shit on the top level subreddit but theres plenty of communities that would downvoted the shit out of those comments and a pot of people use reddit for the stuff completely i personally love rfitness despite the occasional broscience and rfrugalmalefashion just to encourage my bad shopping habits just because someone uses reddit doesnt mean they browse comments or encourage that type of racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,esoteric kekism is a religion of peace pepe didnt do nothin i think trump might come out of this less hated than when he went in there are only two genders leaving the united states means surrendering your freedom of speech plz ban
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,protest votes didnt get trump elected before you jump down my throat i voted for hillary
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be honest it is pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you referring to the lack of empathy here for the innocent people who would have been killed by this little jihadi if he hadnt prematurely exploded
ShitRedditSays,removed,im obviously not going to defend terrorism but this terrorist blowing himself up prematurely and killing his more than likely supportive family is a tragedy as opposed to killing a bunch of innocent people at a wedding or a soccer game justsrsthings
ShitRedditSays,removed,for me i just dont like feeling like a blob im not a prideful person or full of vanity but i do want to feel healthier lmfao of course youre a hamplanet
ShitRedditSays,removed,elaborate
ShitRedditSays,removed,why should we empathize with someone who would never even consider empathizing with us
ShitRedditSays,removed,um its a joke i dont know what you expected
ShitRedditSays,removed,how can you have a problem with that many women and would also say that they would want to go into mens locker rooms a lot of us would do creepy stuff if we were invisible
ShitRedditSays,removed,well fuck them for being happy with where they are
ShitRedditSays,removed,too real
ShitRedditSays,removed,so to you reddit is but a hive mind no one here can make individual statements from their own opinion with it reflecting on the site as a whole
ShitRedditSays,removed,pol is at least partly satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah dont know why they would demonize looting stores or rioting in general
ShitRedditSays,removed,they were gifts they swear
ShitRedditSays,removed,unjerk ableism isnt funny jerk healthy male sexuality
ShitRedditSays,removed,correction on rules to protect rape accuser
ShitRedditSays,removed,alright making the call that reee is making fun of the noise that an autistic person might make when upset which is p gross plz to replace with lul or pleases my peen etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,they actually have to actively fabricate things to be mad about like sjws
ShitRedditSays,removed,false rape accusations are a serious problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok let me break this down for you it really is much easier for a woman any woman to get laid men will sleep with anything the thing is women generally only go for a certain type men who are confident but these men only comprise a minority of the male population hence a small pool of men get most of the women we see this very prominently in monkeys and offshoots its pretty simple mate
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha thats actually pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,how the fuck was this not reported to the police in what fucked up world do academic bodies get to arbitrate on actual damn crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,well the ufo comparison is fair just not really relevant to what he responded to if the guy was saying all these women claiming he raped them obviously at least one of them is telling the truth then it wouldve fit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know that calling someone a thug isnt always a racial thing i was meaning to refer to the whole theres a difference between blacks and niggers thing and how if you say that on someone would still call you an sjw
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know deliberately ignoring the argument is about par for the course in this place the solipsism is real
ShitRedditSays,removed,stereotypes they tend to exist for a reason
ShitRedditSays,removed,almost kills someone he made his nose bleed
ShitRedditSays,removed,what was the original post
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a black man said the white nationalist
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you like throwing gays off of roof tops i understand but disagree
ShitRedditSays,removed,please dont talk shit about duterte if you dont know anything about the grp or lack any connection to the filipino people im assuming this because youre posting on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,hmmm racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,blm certainly take up real issues but they go about it so stupidly
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does it feel knowing the altright has done to reddit in yr what you could not do in yrs
ShitRedditSays,removed,but then we would have no fash ing
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean she literally did say shut white people down which sounds like bellitling to me but what do i know im a white male
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,im heavily suspecting the person who posted this has skin white as bleach though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i kinda think that the cause of trump is because of the left
ShitRedditSays,removed,but you arent racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,who are you talking to
ShitRedditSays,removed,im black btw like legit black not the as a black man
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah im sure that contestant instantly thought of the show guidelines he never read and it totally wasnt his male ego being shattered in a country where you throw acid on a womans face when shes too beautiful or you kill your sister if shes raped edit aww i made the fragile little boys upset stay afraid manbabies we are coming to snipsnip you in the middle of the night i told you to kill yourself after you threatened castration so your claim to have the moral high ground is laughable your obviously sexist and butthurt maybe you should try omitting your transgressions to manipulate people into feeling sorry for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,logical fallacy much
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait people get banned here all the time for claiming it was a joke 🤔 i guess this joke must be fine
ShitRedditSays,removed,i do wonder to which degree it was a joke though well i guess ill go back to lurking and browsing disgusting subs
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait i dont understand why this is bad its a pretty serious accusation that will follow that person for life we probably shouldnt be claiming they did it without them actually being convinced that goes for all accusations
ShitRedditSays,removed,can someone explain me why all the mods end in archangelle i was reading up on the history of srs but didnt find an explanation
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont hit people and if you do dont get mad if they hit you
ShitRedditSays,removed,in his indian culture it is unthinkable that a woman gets violent against a man do you people really support cultural appropriation of our western culture to not fight back when being attacked by females it is against his own culture you people are oppressing him he had a right to slap her back
ShitRedditSays,removed,because is jewish tells us something about the person is a jew seems to tell us everything about the person its reductive and has a tendency to be used perjoratively similar to how englishman is fine but chinaman is not context connotation and tone all play a part though
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy goddamn oversimplification batman
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you for saying this theres often a weird antisemitic current in a lot of social action communities i have a theory that it actually is because jews are still viewed as having secret power or ultimate control over the world ah the good ol jewish conspiracy for world domination and are thus an authority to be fought against but stabbing sleeping year olds and launching rockets at preschools no it is israel that is evil
ShitRedditSays,removed,im totally with you theres a strange current in the social justice movement that makes me feel very unwelcome just for being jewish and not thinking israel is literally the greatest evil in the world
ShitRedditSays,removed,the true liberals of reddits views on muslims seem to have far more in common with right wing nuts than actual progressives
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes and no like i said depends heavily on context and tone see jews are literally to blame for everything thats wrong in the world we would be living diseasefree in outerspace if not for the trouble your parasitic people have caused yeah funny how jews are fine with destroying other peoples countries but manage to pull it together when they want to keep their own country safe must be nice having a place to run away to hes actually a just a typical leftist jew and i totally agree that they should be banned from education positions and then shipped back to israel vs almost twothirds of british jews voted to stay in eu poll shows theyre obviously different maybe ive just heard jews used derogatorily too many times and its skewing my perception of it but this is my lived experience
ShitRedditSays,removed,comment on the death of a junkie yall too sensitive
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre fat arent you
ShitRedditSays,removed,no im serious i just feel this joke is so bad that im surprised people have any sort of reaction to it
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit loves giving white christians shit see ratheism
ShitRedditSays,removed,and makes lesbians lose their gold star s this strikes me as extremely homophobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,couldnt agree more
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is still probably the only thing i really dont understand about srs yeah this sub takes a weird set of stances but they are somewhat consistent in their defense of people who are different oppressed and in general not the golden default standard of a western citizen unless they are pedophiles then everything gets thrown to garbage and srs becomes rpedohate you really arent much better in this respect than any of the hate subs you helped to destroy
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,you got me good
ShitRedditSays,removed,rrdwut aw how adorable you shitposted my comment on srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,concern troll lol broski i just said that the op was linking to a fella who was exaggerating for comedic effect i couldnt give two scoops of anal creampie for either member of this equation and judging by the content you chose to highlight i imagine youre not a louis ck fan probably a little too hardcore for you you strike me as someone who is probably obnoxious vapid disingenuous and just an insult to intelligence and dignity i could have sworn i read about a good word to summarize all those traits somewhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is what happens when the trigger is maximized its triggered by other triggerees
ShitRedditSays,removed,said the guy whos on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,subredditcancer is now part of the fempire
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait but so are you
ShitRedditSays,removed,he said he was fat because he ate unhealthily seems to me like he realized he was unhealthy and wanted to change that i see nothing about being harassed
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree theres plenty of other poop in that thread but unless im missing some context that has since been deleted the two posts quoted in the title dont seem to be poop
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is incel
ShitRedditSays,removed,cleaning and child care should actually just be done for free so according to you men never clean or do yard work or take care of the house at all its all a womans job i assume you think that quitting your job and raising a child is forced by men onto women and not something that a normal couple discusses between each other or maybe perhaps the gender disparity between college high and low paying college major choices could possibly lead to women being more likely to quit their job as the husbands job is more likely to provide more money for the family women arent looked down on for being assertive when trying to negotiate wages women arent passed up for promotions for bullshit reasons all the time while there are studies out there that show this there are many studies that show that women are much less likely to be assertive in the first place i wasnt able to find any data that supports this theory but my theory is that due to the lower frequency of females requesting promotions and negotiating wages the occurrence of such an event creates an initial negative reaction due to how unfamiliar it is in the majority of situations the reason most ceos are men is because all those men are more qualified than any woman its not about the quality its about the quantity there are more male ceos because more men choose that career path and its not exactly an easy path either but men are more willing to take risks are are because women are less capable than men in every way its not that they arent capable its that men are more likely to choice the majors that will lead them to becoming ceos like i said before thats not sexism its biology personal life choices i think i fixed that there are no men with less education or who are less qualified than the women who work for them the five cent disparity when equal work is compared means literally nothing first of all httpwwwpayscalecomdatapackagesgenderpaygap second of all while is still a gap it is still slowly closing it may take a few decades but the best way for the gap to close is naturally over time as old generations of employers and employees get replaced by new generations the last remaining shred of the wage gap will eventually fade away the women choiced all their choices of their own choice there are no factors contributing to wage gap except for the stupidity of women first off try again with that grammar secondly i am sure that there are other factors that contribute to the wage gap besides sexism such as the fact that women tend to have httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexualdimorphismhumans making men perform better in certain jobs simply due to biology life isnt exactly easy for men either men die from suicide more than women men account for of all occupational deaths men are required to register for selective service while women are not may change soon women are much more likely to get custody of children than men
ShitRedditSays,removed,who would determine what posts stay and which go
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have a question ive heard that the gap only exists based on the average man and the average woman choosing different paying careers is the reason the gap exists also men cant have children so they dont stop their career to raise them is this wrong or misleading im honestly just asking because ive heard this constantly
ShitRedditSays,removed,but then how is remedied
ShitRedditSays,removed,uhh why are you being an incestophobe if they are both consenting adults what is the problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats wrong with incest as long as all parties consent
ShitRedditSays,removed,which clubhouse
ShitRedditSays,removed,ignorant poster who has never visited india they defecate in the rivers
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was really angry when i heard about this at first but after reading a comment someone made i understood why a judge might do something like this it isnt so much for his benefit but so that the jury isnt speculating about the victims willingness to participate in sex with her attacker
ShitRedditSays,removed,can i get some sources here i would love to learn more i was defending the wage gap like you people but i got schooled pretty hard and never looked back
ShitRedditSays,removed,it sucks how racism against indians is tolerated and even encouraged on the internet but say something about any other race and they will have their pitchforks out no time
ShitRedditSays,removed,you must be really informed on history we can really tell
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah it could have something to do with men working jobs that result in them dying at working times as often as women and getting compensated for it but no men and women work the exact same jobs
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not really what sexism is
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah theyre not theyre trying to make other people smile maybe laugh a little bit with a mindless throwaway joke on the internet what sexist stereotype do you think theyre invoking
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol a shitpost comment on a shitpost i made got here lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,so close
ShitRedditSays,removed,where the sexism
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a fan i have to disagree on flacco sucking he single handedly killed our dynasty 😢
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry but pedophiles who dont act on their urges are scum of the earth same as homocidial maniacs who dont actually murder people are still scum
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait are you saying poc can be racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,well seeing as loyalservantofbrd discussed players talent level it seems they brought up football for discussion
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is actually accurate i was molested as a child for many many years he is in jail now there is a huge difference between attraction and action sure to us its a gross attraction but thats like telling a teenage boy hey stop being attracted to tits and ass as long as they dont act on it or view sexually explicit material that involves harming children its okay ish like ew still
ShitRedditSays,removed,the freest most egalitarian society in human history umm sorry buddy last time i checked north korea was set up by asians
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre not oppressed at all if anything they have more opportunity then whites
ShitRedditSays,removed,i only got like upchimps so its not even that popular also its not a racist joke its a reverse racist joke i pretended he was racist when he really wasnt no one was actually racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i made the implication that the person above me was racist thats racist i want you to explain to me why i hate a certain race because i didnt even know i did
ShitRedditSays,removed,nope i made no comparison i called out a fake racist gee you guys sure like to have fun i wish i was this good at going out of my way to get offended
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this subreddit mostly basically just jokes that doesnt align with your peoples humour
ShitRedditSays,removed,im glad you told me you won the argument i didnt even realize hey let me try hey youre a racist go away gee that was way easier than actually making a real argument i guess i did learn something after all
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh please im not the one who submitted a post about a comment on a forum on the internet about a funny chimpanzee gif for being possibly racist although really not if thats the kind of stuff that offends you id suggest staying away from the internet
ShitRedditSays,removed,good
ShitRedditSays,removed,is he wrong stupid people breed stupidity
ShitRedditSays,removed,wtf
ShitRedditSays,removed,white privilege fuck i wish i would have had some of that in this life
ShitRedditSays,removed,when you say people of colour you know youre basically saying coloured person right
ShitRedditSays,removed,nįgger
ShitRedditSays,removed,educate yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont get it this comment isnt really sexism or bigoted is there a category to post i missed
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre really grasping at straws here the employer should not compensate you when you are on your period its a biological function that happens monthly take personal time off or take unpaid absents
ShitRedditSays,removed,that was pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think it was a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,i literally did in the further comments and i provided source for it i may be wrong on this but based from my personal experience and my friends experience majority of our female colleagues are incompetent unlike the ones who got the job because more women in stem become popular standards are drastically falling because of this in general i want hiring based on competence not the gender fuck me for asking for equality i dont realise how am i the monster here
ShitRedditSays,removed,quick glance at your history led me to the information that you managed to fuck up x on centos which is one of the most stable server os there is someone who works entire life in techprogramming industry could not possibly do that from my personal experience never run terminal and especially when youre drunk also read my previous comments equality above all
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you making fun of my poverty by any chance rich white girl
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay i hate being in fight with anyone you and people here seem fueled by pure hate what do you want me to do im just wondering do you have any goals in particular if im wrong on something please do correct me but from what i read here your main argument is youre middle class white dude and you dont have the need to argue because youre right am i gonna encounter some real disscussion here or is it just rich frustrated white women filled with hatred
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont even know what this sub is about i thought it was equivalent of where people would post dank memes
ShitRedditSays,removed,how exactly are they scum chip and joanna have nothing to do with any of the things you mentioned is it not possible to care about all those things and get annoyed when so called journalists try to destroy someones reputation on next to no information
ShitRedditSays,removed,trump said some things that upset me so im going to have to side with the actual human rights violators on this one
ShitRedditSays,removed,another reason to hate sane people they cant understand why everybody hates them like ucallmecismale delete your account bloke
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think we should recognize that pedophilia isnt a choice pedophiles that havent committed crimes need psychological help and we should respect them and support them or at the very least not call them disgusting do you think people are okay with being attracted to year olds not a lot of people are people dont want to be attracted to children but they are how is it fair to harp on people that are attracted to year olds when they cant control it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love shitposting
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah bullshit fedorasmras on tumblr have been in my experience the most levelheaded whereas there are literally feminists on tumblr calling for killing off a small fraction of the male population youre full of shit and clearly a rabid feminist who is allergic to supporting any ideology other than their own
ShitRedditSays,removed,wage gap you do realize that was debunked hundreds of times it does not exist most likely never did
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was wondering when you racists were gonna crawl out of the woodwork you always seem to around here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i actually agree with this man you guys and girls should take what he says and actually think about it rationally before getting mad and all defensive you are not helping anybody this guy has a right to political opinions and toxic people like you try to shut him down you downvote his comment because it must be racist sexist etc this man isnt being any of that when someone has a different political view than you maybe you should try to think about why they have that opinion try to understand them by downvoting and getting mad at this comment you keep on being a stereotypical liberal thats how we conservatives see it
ShitRedditSays,removed,bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,removed,because sandersforpres represents every antitrump supporter on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,so basically there are people on reddit only on two subs and that alone proves that reddit loves trump
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree that white nationalism is not an equal and valid view point that is worthy of tolerance but why are people celebrating that this guy was sucker punched ive seen it in this sub and elsewhere hes still a human being most people dont know who he is and he isnt making any real noise as far as i know sucker punching him does no one any good i only see it bringing more attention to this asshole and with that possibly more followers
ShitRedditSays,removed,well my evidence is only anecdotal but the video is spreading and a lot of people are not aware of this guy all they see is a guy getting sucker punched and are reacting with liberals have gone too far and similar sentiments i didnt mean to imply that its going to cause there to be more nazis that was a poor choice of words but i think it does give them fuel to fight back whenever they see isolated incidents like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,good points i guess some of the shit ive been seeing on fbook youtube and reddit had me discouraged dont get me wrong it feels good to see that asshole get punched in the face but i still dont agree with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,if this is considered concern trolling ill delete it my apologies
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is quite literally fake news the entire website was revamped and all the old content removed and replaced with new content he didnt go picking and choosing what to remove in all likelihood he doesnt support lgbt rights or environmentalism but the website storys just make the left look stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,well if youve been around some women who gravitate towards certain wealth he was actually factually correct in the description
ShitRedditSays,removed,curb stomp nazis
ShitRedditSays,removed,a bullet to the head really
ShitRedditSays,removed,im saying he should be killed rkillthosewhodisagree
ShitRedditSays,removed,the truth stings a bit doesnt it
ShitRedditSays,removed,excuse me but how is not fascist behaviour or httpwwwmetalinsidernetfestivalsblastfestcancelpestenoiresappearanceatfestivalduetoantifapressure is tolerable behaviour is not how a fascist would behave telling us what or what not to listen to
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit this is my fucking school
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you even look at the examples how is antifa any better than the fascists when they pull shit like that muh ethnic cleansing
ShitRedditSays,removed,so much for freedom of speech
ShitRedditSays,removed,i consider myself socialdemocrat and i partially agree there is a different strong regressive left movement in the us right now but its not all of the modernleft and theses regressiveleft are still a small minority in the movement so whats the regressive left well youtuber like gazi kodzo who get a lot of attention are great example of what people claim is regressiveleft and when antitrump activists try to block access to the presidential inauguration i also consider this as regressiveleft
ShitRedditSays,removed,like treatment for his mental illness
ShitRedditSays,removed,because thats counter to the laws and ideologies of most countries on earth
ShitRedditSays,removed,what did he say kek
ShitRedditSays,removed,so theyre mentally healthy okay
ShitRedditSays,removed,well communists have killed times as many people as the rest of the others combined so
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am very aware of what mental illness is and i feel like this sort of thinking is learned and can be changed
ShitRedditSays,removed,in what way am i an ableist of you dont mind sharing kind stanger
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes but maybe all jokes are at the expense of someone else this is what i think after reading comments and also i think maybe not talking about mental disease and maybe just word which can also no mean mental disease
ShitRedditSays,removed,hmm i do not think good idea imo because not good in countries like china where in dictatorship so if they say something government does not agree with they go missing but at same time i see where u r coming from as if u find something offence then ppl cannot say it so no offence for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is pc mean
ShitRedditSays,removed,hmm well man i have not been on forum for long but i see ppl with children so i think at least some love made
ShitRedditSays,removed,such an obvious joke come on guys
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,then salon write an article about how brave you are
ShitRedditSays,removed,toxic person i see that used on the internet so much these days where did it come from it sounds like some poppseduopsychology catchphrase as for your exfriends a lot of people see disagreement as criticism of themselves personally they cant separate themselves from ideas i was dealing with one of these people online a couple days ago he somehow got into his mind that i was calling him a misogynistic pig because i told him a joke he made was sexist people dont want to be thought badly of and people also seem to hate reflecting on possible flaws in themselves its a negative experience so if i were you i wouldnt take it personally
ShitRedditSays,removed,yall dikes need to get laid and lighten tf up
ShitRedditSays,removed,except its fine for us to make fun of white males because reverse racism and sexism against men doesnt exist
ShitRedditSays,removed,legal steroids god damnit youre a damn asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,meh even in this sub it sometimes sucks to hear my friend moved to canada from russia and i was his only friend throughout most of school kids were busy making jokes about how he and his family are all drunkards who spent all their time drinking vodka and thats why we had no friends that was racism and sometimes people here making jokes about things like that can be hurtful even if its just a circlequeef
ShitRedditSays,removed,but the point is he was a straight white guy and caring about him was the best thing anyone could have done at the time would you not agree
ShitRedditSays,removed,well they arent wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok this is pretty funnydepressing i went through a few comments of that guys post history out of morbid curiosity in one comment in response to asking if he knows any actual muslim people he says he personally knows several and then later in another comment in a separate thread he claims he was a muslim himself nice little rasamuslim in action man thats a shitty person
ShitRedditSays,removed,trump is not a fascist hes a populist whenever you use the word fascist to describe people like trump it dilutes the meaning of the word everyone is called fascist these days
ShitRedditSays,removed,and you cant even compare western countries to the oppression and human right violations of muslim countries the west isnt even close to that extreme
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats wrong with this
ShitRedditSays,removed,rodditers dont understand that a male gets to decide who his female is allowed to talk to deal with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,well didnt he
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats reginald denny
ShitRedditSays,removed,there was that video of a bunch of black dudes dragging a white guy into a fire though wasnt there
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry what do you mean a source like the actual video i think if you google charlotte protest drag man fire youll be able to find it i personally watched the video myself and thats what looked to have happened
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is wrong with this unless youre one of the sjws that looks for things to be offended by because being offended is now a power stance how is any of this offensive they are mocking things that are wrong with the world
ShitRedditSays,removed,can someone please explain to me what is wrong with this there is a real problem today where people will be tagged as sexist racist or what have you simply for disagreeing with people there is a real thing with super far left liberals taking down someones stance simply because they are a white male so can someone explain to me why mocking these ridiculous practices is bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not transphobic you psychopath its mocking people that will get offended for trans people in times where its not even necessary
ShitRedditSays,removed,or maybe they do and they are just making fun of the sjws that accuse people of misgendering in situations where there is no misgendering
ShitRedditSays,removed,so predictable
ShitRedditSays,removed,right about the same time drumpf gets old for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,from st peters we all think youre a wanker get over it
ShitRedditSays,removed,this was mostly a sub to vent we dont spend our lives on reddit many of us are involved in local politics look at polls all over europe to see which way the wind is blowing in my country front national is now clearly the dominant party especially among the demographic we will win and take our countries back
ShitRedditSays,removed,one step closer to the gulag comrades
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet he still jacks off to her furiously this makes him doubly weird hhhhgggnnn ehhh feminazi bitch uggghh fuck youre hot logs on to reddit and writes a small novel on a woman hes never met not creepy though
ShitRedditSays,removed,try me
ShitRedditSays,removed,im probably going to get down voted for this but dont you guys think its kinda wrong to celebrate a subreddit being shutdown ill admit that im conservative but im a conservative that doesnt share reuropean mindset and ideology however i think everyone should have an equal opportunity on this site to speak their mind and congregate with other likeminded individuals
ShitRedditSays,removed,people all over the world take videos of shit with their phones if an oldass building were on fire in the us and there were a ton of people around theyd be videoing it its shitty but thats people for you not too many buildings are that shitty in the us especially around places with large groups of people there are rundown buildings but not in large cities the situation is clearly different in egypt or did you mean to say that the egyptians were unpleasant httpsyourlogicalfallacyiscomstrawman never implied nor inferred unless you think egyptians are unpleasant in which case id say you should probably look over your own life
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck you
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck you too
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck you
ShitRedditSays,removed,blaze it faget
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop trying to justify the joak trans people feel they are not in the right body can you not understand that did i trigger you shitlord you broke rule x too
ShitRedditSays,removed,destroy those who dont agree with our ideas thatll teach em and while were at it lets completely lie to the media about him being racist too
ShitRedditSays,removed,muslims niggers kikes leftists and faggots are pretty much oven deserving degenerates there is a chamber waiting for them
ShitRedditSays,removed,so uantiheliphobebot has been shadowbanned
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you guys just make up what people mean when they say something i said one conversation topic annoys me in a thread about unpopular opinions just because im annoyed by something does not mean that i think they should stop talking about it it just means ill probably zone out when you do so you can manufacture any hate you want im not apologizing for an honest reaction i never once said they should keep to themselves or any other ridiculousness i just said i dont care and conversations revolving gender are often conflated with knee jerk reactions like yours and thats one of the annoying components
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i do care about people putting word in my mouth in order to justify their reaction i said what i said but if people are going to accuse me of meaning something else so that i can be their target i am going to respond
ShitRedditSays,removed,no there is no conditions see this is what i mean about putting words in my mouth you can identify as whatever gender or no gender if you want i dont care i dont care how you view yourself in general i like most people to be happy unless your an asshole that does not mean i cant be annoyed by some of the attitudes surrounding it for example everyone said caitlyn jenner was so brave etc and anyone who said anything negative was a transphobic asshole i know this may be a minority view but it was a very vocal one well what if i though bruce was an asshole now i need to like caitlyn or im transphobic no i didnt care for bruce so i dont care for caitlyn i know that these are minority views but its something that i hear a lot about and it annoys me thats it im not telling any people to live according to me do what you want i really dont care i just answered my unpopular opinion as was the topic of the thread i dont spend much time thinking about this im not home dwelling on trans issues
ShitRedditSays,removed,lotta defense of liberal white feminism in here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i can see that i wasnt trying to bait any kind of reaction i honestly think the opinions that annoy me dont even come from trans people but rather and i hate using this term but dont have a better one armchair sjws
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is back again i reposted the comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,would you rather have down syndrome and win medals at the special olympics or not have down syndrome
ShitRedditSays,removed,would you rather fight regular sized olympic medals or giant special olympics medal
ShitRedditSays,removed,meh i have nothing against veganism i do know some bitchy people who push veganism on everyone but thats because theyre shit and not veganism being shit it mystifies me how much reddit hates meatexclusive diets im not proud to admit that im a shitty person who eats meat because i dont have enough willpower to eat foods that taste bad to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh relax
ShitRedditSays,removed,and as a fruit who identifies as a coyote im okay with that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am a woman no lando youre a man and always will be not everyone is willing to buy into your delusions
ShitRedditSays,removed,the problem is you guys were never funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,were australian so were not going in too deep i just need to point out the double standards clinton has to face basically
ShitRedditSays,removed,when asked what character youd remove from a show to make better id remove amy schumer from inside amy schumer at utc replied to id remove amy schumer from inside amy schumer
ShitRedditSays,removed,i warn you that whole thread is toxic cis white males strike again
ShitRedditSays,removed,amy schumer lol im fat and slutty someone else lol amy schumer is fat and slutty if you that joking about yourself and insulting other people are the same thing im not sure what youre doing with yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,its an objectively bad sub and sadly lsc is going down the same road
ShitRedditSays,removed,how many hours per week would you say you spend contemplating how white people have ruined absolutely everything for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,well she does suck
ShitRedditSays,removed,an hour in and every comment so far is down voted ive never seen this before cant we all just get along
ShitRedditSays,removed,i watched some of her stand up when i was on the plane it was fine liked it also liked that trainwreck film she did some people seem to have an issue with so called womens jokes like talking about sex from her perspective not sure how this is different from a generation of comedians making fun of their wives or mother in laws
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont really see how this is sexist tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a thing i see a lot of men not finding female comedians funny and then deciding that they are objectively unfunny and complaining when they get a lot of gigs thing is people who arent those men do find the comedians comediennes funny and there are still loaaaads of menfunny comedians you can watch if you dont find them funny so it seems really entitled to complain about it and for gods sake dont send me a paragraph about why a female comedian is objectively not as funny as her male counterparts
ShitRedditSays,removed,amy schumer louie ck
ShitRedditSays,removed,in all fairness i havent seen any evidence from actual scientists that genderfluidity exists either theres plenty of evidence for the existence of transgenderism but thats not whats being talked about
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously if a black dude dates anything other than black women exclusively i know he is times out of a piece of garbage
ShitRedditSays,removed,real talk tho she needs to be removed and replaced with a woc amy schumer is liberal white feminism to the extreme
ShitRedditSays,removed,women are funny get over it
ShitRedditSays,removed,people have to realize that even though others have their own beliefs they cant push them on others or attack them for not agreeing christians read in their bible that even though homosexuality is a sin they are to love all love the person not the sin others feel that homosexuality is ok and that is their opinion people who attack others on the basis of their orientation or encourage it are wrong on the other hand people should not be attacked if they have views that might be considered old fashioned get along people
ShitRedditSays,removed,its an altright hub best to avoid
ShitRedditSays,removed,the top or answers in that whole thread are women
ShitRedditSays,removed,people who are genderfluid is no evidence at all tons of people claim to be abducted by aliens for example but that doesnt make their word evidence in either direction selfreporting is notoriously unreliable that study is interesting though but i dont have access to the article itself so i can only go on the abstract which uses the word hypothesize a lot particularly in regards to the most useful claim about hemisphere switching and the toc which speaks of respondents speaking strongly for transgenderism the scientific proof is much stronger eg the old gray matter method during autopsies and the new white matter scans on living people not to mention the connection to intersexuality for genderfluidity the proof isnt there yet
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit isnt a single person you cant just attribute every shitty vile disgusting thing youve ever seen posted on reddit to a bogeyman that you just call reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is legit revenge fantasy of a sociopath disturbing
ShitRedditSays,removed,comment count is one higher than it should be looks like someone might have been shadowbanned
ShitRedditSays,removed,as somebody here mentioned yes perhaps i could have worded it better but my message was that a terrorist for example is no less deserving of compassion than somebody with your everyday depression that is what unconditional love is when i forgive the world and everybody in it i find peace this is what works for me i dont expext it to work for everybody else
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are certainly other volatile religions any zealot throwing homosexuals off of rooftops and imprisoning rape victims are worthy of denouncement
ShitRedditSays,removed,they get hanged and tossed off buildings by fellow muslims
ShitRedditSays,removed,havent you heard because done brainwashed illiterate muslim in a wartorn region thinks gays should be stoned thats what the muslim doctor who lives in the us believes no need to ask thats automatically true had a guy actually try to argue this with me
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you also look at the rest of the post this isnt bad at all the op of this comment is only wishing that those people get exactly what they blindly voted for honestly there shitty situation will go up in flames sooner rather than later its funny how the states with the highest number of trump supporters also have the highest numbers of people on obamacare and welfare which their president elect and party affiliate desperately wants to demolish or defund its sooo great the poetic justice of it all just has me in a fit of laughter whenever it comes to mind i too wish that they get everything they voted for
ShitRedditSays,removed,so do black people
ShitRedditSays,removed,no offense but if you replaced white with black it becomes really racist sounding you shouldnt stereotype anyone based on how some members of the group act just like how you shouldnt judge every black person because a few of them tipped you badly most of them could be negotiated with black guys liked to hide that they were angry to be polite then throw tantrums if they didnt get their way maybe its the area i worked in it was an urban neighborhood and close to low and working class residences lots of hood rats and single black guys around
ShitRedditSays,removed,but i dont my post is being taken out of context and now im grouped with a side i dont want a side i want a new problem solving model for inequality and injustice but it seems that when you engage either side you are labelled and thrust into the other corner i dont dig on divisive language i think well find it promotes the problem rather than solves it and now this thread thinks i want women to stay in the kitchen or something and the amazing thing is none of you will think for a moment that you could just be the other side of the coin you are them
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true its just another form of psychological sterilization the elite has to weed out the weak mines somehow
ShitRedditSays,removed,women just tend to say they are better at multitasking much more than men say it in my experience
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sympathetic to this if people make uninformed decisions and vote based entirely on emotion is it really so awful to hope they suffer some consequences for their bad choices i dont want anything to happen to vulnerable people who didnt vote for trump but i do feel spite towards trump supporters even the ones who will be negatively effected by a trump presidency
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair i agree with the poster cant wait till the rednecks realize just how fucking stupid they were to have believed his dumb shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have zero sympathy for trump supporters i hope they suffer
ShitRedditSays,removed,happy to have tweaked such interest more sarcasm to come no doubt millenialand is a targetrich environment
ShitRedditSays,removed,selfimportance is without peer
ShitRedditSays,removed,i identify as three slices of toast one buttered one plain and one with jam the plain one is burnt the buttered one is under done and the one with jam is just right my preferred pronoun is voltron
ShitRedditSays,removed,i absolutely wish death and disease on trump supporters they voted in a literal neonazi the world would be better if they were all lying in a ditch somewhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,are they not the ones who are the most vehemently for him
ShitRedditSays,removed,i havent really seen that much evidence of that tbh but our experiences could differ
ShitRedditSays,removed,no im pretty sure we are criticizing islam for homophobia here guess what homophobia isnt magically okay when muslims do it
ShitRedditSays,removed,is every ml a tankie
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats where youre wrong islam isnt homophobic in the sense that you think the strawmuslims may be homophobic but just as the guy says in the comment op is linking to they say treat people in the lgbtq community with respect unlike the christian counterpart who says they should be flogged and dead both in the book and by the person
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats the functional difference between calling gid a mental illness and calling transsexuals mentally ill my understanding is that you arent trans unless you have gid so its kind of something that goes with the territory
ShitRedditSays,removed,well
ShitRedditSays,removed,has more to do with politics the stupids are galvanized en masse to hate each other by people in power hate is a great motivator and it tends to make people stop thinking critically one of the oldest tricks in the book were probably better off with them hating each other i just wish all these innocent people didnt get caught in the crossfire
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt say that
ShitRedditSays,removed,we dont punch down
ShitRedditSays,removed,aaaand you just stooped to the level of the comment youre complaining about
ShitRedditSays,removed,as the person behind this comment im confused as to why it got to you so much its a simple fact less skill less entertainment thats why theyre so unpopular
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh i agree i mean you can think whatever you want inside your own head but the second you say to a gay person i think youre a sinner then you definitely deserve to be called out and shaton for saying so
ShitRedditSays,removed,im happy for people to think that of me on the proviso that it doesnt affect their actions in any way the second that they mention it to anyone theyre no longer entitled to it
ShitRedditSays,removed,no its not fucking reasonable pupbenned
ShitRedditSays,removed,ten feet higher
ShitRedditSays,removed,well hes not wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,only if you could find it
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay so are we criticising the parent comment which was about respect and tolerance or all three shitstain comments that came after it because honestly the parent comment seemed to be coming from a place of if not a lack of bigotry at least tolerance
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre not good lmfao
ShitRedditSays,removed,a trans woman is a biological woman too you dont know that this often confuses me trans is terribly vague when its used does is mean transgender transsexual transvestite translator i have to guess from context and its rarely clear
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree some of them do
ShitRedditSays,removed,so do you give it or take it
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi im the asshole from the thread some people responded in a civil manner telling me how bio is not a useful term and i agreed i expressed a preference that i really dont like hate the term cis telling me its logical doesnt mean i have to like it its a preference a feeling and is thus none of your fucking business and anyone telling me im wrong for thinking that way is just another essentialist whatever and cue the easily triggered gender warriors ready to call me a bunch of names and strut over my fallen corpse yawn
ShitRedditSays,removed,im far from normal you presume
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey smug bullshitwhat did you win
ShitRedditSays,removed,this subreddit makes me wanna kill myself
ShitRedditSays,removed,seconds thats not how the metric system works it says that is seconds and in pro gaming that is very noticeable excluding reaction times theres another big reason why there arent any big female teams in csgo and thats because more males play csgo than females yes i know but that is in the general sense the same studies that say that here is an almost equal distribution in people playing videogames also say and httpimagesfastcompanycomuploadgenderbreakdownjpg csgo is a hardcore game and following those statistics we can say with confidence that there are many more male csgo players than females therefore there will be many more male pro teams than female pro teams httpwebstanfordeduniederlenvannualreviewprintpdf study also shows that males are more competitive therefore they will join csgo competitions much more often than females i dont mean to be an asshole but the data shows why it is like it is right now would it be good to have more female teams in esports of course it would should we enforce any rules to change this no we should not in gaming your gender does not matter when you join a competition you are just a character if a group of females want to create a team and join the competitions they can and they will play the same as every other team whoever wins wins thats it we are not going to force females to start playing in video game competitions if they do not want to
ShitRedditSays,removed,what makes you think reddit has something against women sure the neckbeards do but there a small very vocal minority
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont disagree
ShitRedditSays,removed,shut up you faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,you think you have it bad just wait until my six year old niece finds out shes a dude
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not true i am not a straight white abled cis bro and im neither hostile to myself nor have i had any shortage of communities within eve that display no such intention its rather ironically bigoted of you to assume that i am some of those communities like eve university and brave newbies for example actually have stricter standards of language and behavior than this subreddit has you cant swear in uni chat without copping a ban warning it is true that the devs do not police ingame interactions as deeply as other mmos and this is due to several reasons the scale of the universe makes this impossible imagine trying to manually solve moderation cases from over chat channels there are some automatic restrictions in place and ccp isd already has their hands full enforcing the httpscommunityeveonlinecomsupportpoliciestermsofserviceen blocking someone you dont like is simple deliberately trying to get around bans is slow and can be expensive also talk is cheap in eve there are better ways to mess with someone that dont bring their race etc into the picture some comments on the nature of the playerbase players very effectively selfpolice and as a whole are very progressive we even have mentally challenged players on our elected representative board some of whom have been at the forefront of some rather amazing achievements as part of their term there are unspoken rules of conduct beyond the in the tos and of course there are others not being a sore loser is one not screwing newbies not bringing stuff into real life is another once we had a major alliance that decided doxxing was acceptable even after taking bans the rest of eve disagreed and for that and other reasons every other major power basically declared total war players set up a broadcast reps movement to help those with depression and rough times in their life find help i dont think youll find a similar movement in any other game just search reve for undoubtedly there must be some racists neonazis and other people whose opinions are offensive however they have their rights as players too and the game provides you with more than enough tools to ignore them and if you wish counterplay and wreak destruction on them there are also documented instances where when gms find possibility of suicidal thoughts they will to report it and bring local authorities to your house they might be a little overboard but the devs do care about their players its a fun game and you should at least try it its very misunderstood and im glad i was able to start the game and form my own opinion before hearing misconceptions about it we can give you free trial links if you like want to join in on this discussion
ShitRedditSays,removed,so calling a member of the male category by male pronouns is now equal to using racial slurs sorry but if i wanted to be racist to some berkeley criminal i would have called him a spic not a he
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is also a thing called the right to terminate a person can break a contract whenever they want that alone is not illegal pressuring someone into believing they do not have that right just made this account to tell you sorry but this is all wrong a binding contract cannot be breached if you did you are liable for damages i suggest you read more on contract law please dont take offence according to the article the company anything you say after this is not offensive to contract law but you are only repeating what the article is saying
ShitRedditSays,removed,well its true this subreddit seems to have an extreme left wingfeministsjw bias just saying
ShitRedditSays,removed,fat shaming is a legitimate concern however haes healthy at every size is a medically wrong thing to say and deserves all the criticism it gets
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you think eves community is shit you probably wont find game with good community i dont blame you though its easy to get wrong idea of eve community if you approach it like it was some other mmorpg
ShitRedditSays,removed,eugenics wont affect me because im better than the average person i may be a fat virgin living with my parents but my iq is really high oh my god the white genocide nonsense is the worst the same people who cry about that dont care about the whites genociding the native americans africans and each other the more i browse reddit the more i hope a very large meteor strikes earth
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wrote a historical research paper over the nazi euthanasia program and something they did was try to promote eugenics through a movie called i accuse its about a woman with ms who wants die and eventually convinces her two friends to help her die bc they claimed it was the right thing to do im not going to say if its right or wrong but the audience was quite divided by it with young non married people agreeing with the message much more than older or married people so as you said that reddit is mostly i imagine its a consequence of reddits demographics largely young white male stem studentsgraduates it would make sense that theyre proeugenics
ShitRedditSays,removed,the guy with the facist flair is treading the line of crazy and nazism
ShitRedditSays,removed,so nonbinary trans
ShitRedditSays,removed,they actually think we are trying to change the election result lol theyre so stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,while artificial selection is a thing redditors often confuse that with literally nazi pseudoscience eugenics
ShitRedditSays,removed,eugenics even if its done purely voluntarily without any sort of government authority just doesnt work eugenics cant work its utterly at odds with genetics
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,the women have it easier with sex thing is total bullshit if you are an average looking female go on to craigslist tinder okcupid or any fucking site and offer free sex and watch the fucking replies flow in an average looking male will be lucky to even get one reply not only this but go on to any personal ads on craigslist or even dating subreddits here on reddit and youll see that male posts greatly outnumber females posts it isnt even close also youre completely discounting the fact that one gender can have more sex partners with different people on average than the other sex can im probably going to be banned now but i cam here just to say that you dont know what youre talking about
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh man you guys cant take jokes at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean is it wrong to express gratitude to be born into a society with more freedom and liberties than most countries specifically countries who employ sharia law
ShitRedditSays,removed,yuck there are some asian dudes like this think they own the rights to their women get really butthurt if they see an asian girl with nonasian guy really spiteful towards asian girls while simultaneously acting like they need to be guarded like a child
ShitRedditSays,removed,i could never do that saw so many when i visited india like an entire line
ShitRedditSays,removed,white animal raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccccccccccccccccccciiiiiiiiiiiiistttttttt
ShitRedditSays,removed,what if we just paid teachers a fair wage
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have my own personal preferences however i would never vocalise them if they were so pointlessly hurtful to someone else
ShitRedditSays,removed,i fucking hate women daee women are stupjdd
ShitRedditSays,removed,i identify as james bond now give me pussy please
ShitRedditSays,removed,but really theyre making a generalization based on skin color its legit racist lets not excuse it because of what skin color its against
ShitRedditSays,removed,or from my experience a moralfag because some people have reached a point where even the most basic levels of humanity is something to be frowned on
ShitRedditSays,removed,im legitimately confused arent most rapes caused by guys who want to have sex regardless of their partners consent if so how come its said rape is about power rather than sex in those cases it seems pretty clear the desire to get off not the desire to dominate is the driving factor
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am an attack helicopter you will feel my hellfire
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre about to get lit up
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is pretty fucking funny though sorry is humour not allowed here
ShitRedditSays,removed,where did i say muslims were universally badhorrible youve jumped to the conclusion because that is how your mind works youre are bloody special arent you
ShitRedditSays,removed,really clinton is an imperialist who voted for the killing of hundreds of thousands of poc in iraq for oil and power theyre similar only if youre totally focused on us domestic politics and only then if you believe clintons current positions on mass incarceration tpp etc are her real ones
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi there i actually didnt delete any of those comments so
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah polygamy isnt something i could defend nor dispute just using it as a placeholder i think of regressive in this context as sorta like pushing for conformance only for the sake of a power structure i see it happening now on the american left less so than the right to be sure but its happening
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love reading about the end of wwii the mass suicides of nazi fucks the hangings the nazi soldiers being forced to watch videos of the holocaust nazis mysteriously dying while in custody oh my god it is all so fucking sweet the only thing that makes me sad about it is that a lot of them took their children with them and that a lot of them escaped justice
ShitRedditSays,removed,what good can come to society from making death threats
ShitRedditSays,removed,so in other words you agree with him either that or you cant read and were holding it upside down
ShitRedditSays,removed,im mocking your assertion dipshit sorry that was ableist because i pointed out that youre fucking stupid i felt like i needed to clear
ShitRedditSays,removed,you said you read the quran front to back
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok fair play now i assume im gonna get banned soon but on a real note what is this context you mean doesnt the quran call for killing infidels doesnt it call for a political movement that discriminates against women and lgbt people
ShitRedditSays,removed,and youre proof that theyre right
ShitRedditSays,removed,wheres the button where i can call the internet police on him my feelings are taking a bad beating
ShitRedditSays,removed,so your argument for the green party is sure its not perfect but its the best we have sorry but voting for a party that has chance of winning using that logic seems incredibly stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats the point of voting a party candidate you dont support if you are willing to compromise you should vote for a candidate who has a chance at winning
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt ageism imperialism democrats if you support hillary as the only way to beat trump fine but dont pretend like shes actually a good person who should actually be at the head of this machine shes a neoliberal warmonger an adamant supporter of the israeli settler state and when she isnt flipflopping on domestic issues shes an open reformist uninterested in structural change her policy warrants begrudging support at best anything more is nonsense or ethically despicable
ShitRedditSays,removed,who cares about speeches they are all corrupted by capitalism
ShitRedditSays,removed,dumb year old kids are a thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know what to tell you im sure it feels really bad to have had to deal with that but anger and hate arent going to fix it and neither is making people rot in jail forever instead of allowing them to contribute something to society
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay sorry if this is dumb but whats wrong with this i mean its a tired overused joke but i cant see anything offensive about it can somebody explain why you might find it offensive
ShitRedditSays,removed,is it really so wrong to say that they arent interested in anybody with a penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you saying people arent allowed to not like penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a cis im okey with being called that the thing is a lot of people use it as a insult kinda like nigger its true but it may hurt people ps i wont talk about the main thread as i totally agree with this redditor
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is there a problem with dark humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,this person reallyyyyyy needs to get outside for once in his life
ShitRedditSays,removed,idk i probably wouldve upvoted that a few years ago when i was a dysfunctional piece of libertarian trash then i grew up a bit it happens
ShitRedditSays,removed,this seems a bit out of date horrible poop though its in the top percentage of all reddit poop
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you have a penis than youre not a woman youre trans which is completely fine but youre not a woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean theyre fucking jokes i dont understand why youre all bent out of shape
ShitRedditSays,removed,safe space happened
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol the top post in this sub is full of deleted comments
ShitRedditSays,removed,excuse me ill have you know this guy obviously took computer science in college and he will backtrace your floppy disk to find out your dns stick so he can fry your cd drives ram
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre unoriginal jokes but its just dark humor its not like legit pedophilia apology that is oh so common on reddit its just cheap shock humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,ohhh shit guys this one person just ruined my day with this joke even though they dont affect me in any way lets go ruin this shitlords life
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats racist and you should feel bad for being racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,shitty people make offensive jokes but not everybody who uses offensive humor isnt innately a shitty person if you can understand the difference between transgressive humor and real life beliefs then you shouldnt be punished for making a joke just because racists from rthedonald or wherever do the same
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre complaining about people making offensive jokes on a subreddit dedicated to that sort of stuff its low hanging fruit it isnt the same as somebody posting lmao black people steal thing xddddd on an irrelevant post about black people
ShitRedditSays,removed,ignore testing if i am autobanned from any subs for posting here
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know no one in real life talks like that right one day youll grow out of it though hang in there bro
ShitRedditSays,removed,you must have a really busy and productive personal life
ShitRedditSays,removed,the irony of this post is lost on you all
ShitRedditSays,removed,your subreddit is shit and should get banned
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly i really really want trump to win i keep reading all these posts and realize that none of you actual read into his policies or ideals you are only against him because reddit said so fuck bernie make america great again
ShitRedditSays,removed,censorhip comes from the right and the left of the political spectrum i dont know if they are nazisrightwingers who censor but it seems the admin of reddit openly admit to censorship of patriotic or conservative or nationalistic posts that are concerned against illegal islamic immigrant and the flow of muslim migrants to europe if anything the left is getting worse than rightwing parties the left is becoming regressive left the lef has now gone full circle possibly teamed up with islamist moderators and the left has become very joe stalanist now
ShitRedditSays,removed,how about you do your own research instead of pissing people off with your requests to have debates with them
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dunno the first one is clever and the second one is just a move quote
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know this will get imsta deleted from the harpys but you guys realize its possible to saying something crude and offensive like having sex with five year olds without actually wanting to have sex with five year olds
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant make a post because i was involved in the thread but check out
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one is condoning infanticide it was a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,but the case in that thread isnt just ordinary cleft lip and palate its more serious it would take a really experienced surgeon to fix that and there might be harder complications later on in life an amputated hand is worse than an amputated finger same applies here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i laughed
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre an idiot its not literal because its a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre so sensitive you must be new to the internet
ShitRedditSays,removed,you have to love that i made fun of him for not having a sense of humor and his response is to prove it
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was a question i asked because a friend of mine just got raped she really doesnt want to talk about it and i was curious about how they investigated it yes i also enjoy playing computer games with friends i also enjoy hiking and swimming if that also makes me a weirdo i dont understand why this makes my question less relevant
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sir mr sjw are whats wrong with the world likes freedom of speech but only when its your speech i believe your the neckbeard some people dont like coffee and you know what they dont drink it i suggest you apply this reasoning to the situation at hand
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i dont delete my history not to worry there
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is your comment any better doesnt really make sense to shit on someone for saying that then doing the same thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,omg i got a word wrong on the internets while replying on my phone its completely worthless arguing with you youll just never get it and youre too sensitive
ShitRedditSays,removed,white boi do you need to call everyone you disagree with a white male is your world view so pathetically binary that you need to couch everything in terms of us vs them i find it really sad how important you lot seem to think race and gender are i guess im an optimist but i hope you racists eventually see the error of your ways and start seeing race and gender for what they are sets characteristics that have little sway over identity character or self
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres no need to be an asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a attack helicopter gender u cis male fuck boy how dare you oppress me
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,o no roasted u got me xd dont let me trigger you or your gender poc headmates xd
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,you are a bigot
ShitRedditSays,removed,is it not a double standard to downplay everything a man says by using the term mansplaining where as men would use something more condescending it still takes away the purpose of any man saying anything if mansplaining gets tossed around willynilly
ShitRedditSays,removed,what how is speaking your mind mountain dew hotwire snowboarder shaun tony hawk white flipdunk hula hoop doritos gaming xxx privilege i guess im using up my one comment here but youre a damn dingus
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is our in any way whatsoever racist or classist or bigoted or offensive in any way literally all his comment means is that its easy to get robbed in rio
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is this on here how could anyone construe this as offensive in any way
ShitRedditSays,removed,im fairly sure that makes zero sense you just spoke your mind are you wealthy were mlksangerparkset al wealthy youre conflating wealth with twitter followers for whatever goofball reason
ShitRedditSays,removed,im dead serious this level of bullshitery needs to be fucking illegal thats a bit harsh fam most of the things are and should be protected by free speech otherwise the term loses its meaning does not mean i agree with our little helicopterkin here
ShitRedditSays,removed,then why are you such a sexist against men
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre so fucking cool
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikilistofterroristincidentsinindonesia wow look at all the buddist and christian terror attacks listed oh wait another list dominated by the religion of peace but in your defense it is considerably less death than islam causes in other parts of the world tell me again how muslim countries are so stable and awesome
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha fucking keyboard warrior losers
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are noncombat events that i would admit can cause ptsd especially surgery related particularly because of physical pain but take the context a journalist claiming he got ptsd from firing an it barely involves any pain even admitting a bruised shoulder as such trauma mental or physical scarcely existed the usage of the word ptsd in this case is purely for shock value and to push an agenda hope you get alright t a from pol
ShitRedditSays,removed,this guy puts it best im part of the lgbt crowd and i still think these special snowflakes can fuck right off ive had friends on the verge of suicide because they couldnt come to terms with who they are and how much they struggle with their situation and these nutcases wear a label like its an accessoire its immoral its pathetic its disgusting theyre welcome once the existing community has its stuff sorted out too many homotransphobia in this world to deal with any other shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus fucking christ have none of you read what the guy had to say hes a sex addict he regrets it if a clean heroin addict told you that he had robbed for drugs that he had mugged people for money for heroin and he was sati how much he regrets it and that hes thankful that its all in his past yall would be totally ok with that but this you cant handle nooo never mind the many many studies showing sex addiction is a real thing the people who have died as a result of their addictions the rehab programs that exist solely for sex addictionwhich btw can affect people of all genders and sexualities no sex addiction is not a real thing fuck your all youve got your heads so far up your asses you cant even think anymore
ShitRedditSays,removed,and of course this is not in any way offensive or generalizing of course not fuck you
ShitRedditSays,removed,and fuck you
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sexually identify as an overused transphobic copypasta ever since i was a boy i dreamed of spamming other users with my unfunny wall of text people say to me that a person who does this is a laughable idiot and im fucking retarded but i dont care im beautiful im having these words glued all over my body from now on i want people to refer to me as an overused transphobic copypasta as my preferred pronouns and respect my right to paste unfunny transphobic copypastas to reddit in hope of receiving virtual internet points if you cant accept me youre funny and mentally stable and need to check your choice of subreddits thank you for being so understanding
ShitRedditSays,removed,whoa this is a real place you guys are real people wow
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not offensive at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you a bigot no that means you are
ShitRedditSays,removed,that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does competency relate to manfeels what the everlovibg fuck is manfeel if someone uses the term womanfeel would that not be sexist as fuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure hell be totally crushed to be called queer
ShitRedditSays,removed,bad intentions sure but pathetically ineffective as a slur
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol combatting sexist jokes such brave warriors maybe next youll combat female genital mutilation right after youre done combatting the really pressing issues like jokes and manspreading
ShitRedditSays,removed,leave it to white first world college kids to defend an ideology that calls for women to be draped from head to toe calls for the death of gays and calls for the death of apostates
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont really see a problem sjws are always looking for things to be outraged about even if they have to make it up i thought the whole sjw thing was dead anyway since they were getting called out so much ill probably be downvoted for providing an argument that doesnt match the general opinion of this post but whatever id rather there be two sides here
ShitRedditSays,removed,poop
ShitRedditSays,removed,poop
ShitRedditSays,removed,poop
ShitRedditSays,removed,as i interpret the comment he is just joking though
ShitRedditSays,removed,people who generalize men are
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah just got linked to this subreddit you people make me barf
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope im alive to see the day america decriminalizes prostitution i dont understand the negatives tax it regulate it save lives bring joy to men and women everywhere at utc beardedgirl replied to i hope im alive to see the day america decriminalizes prostitution i dont understand the negatives tax it regulate it save lives bring joy to men and women everywhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,bullying wont stop because we remove one reason though besides i have never seen kids being actively bullied this way what i find more astounding is how i havent spoken to any colored person yet who actually supported their cause most found it a waste of time or actively objected in the end something that neither kids nor adults ever really cared about has been blown up to huge proportions getting the un involved even all during wars recession and immigration issues demanding radical change being led by someone who said some actual seriously racist things maybe it has a racist core maybe it was racist when it first appeared but that was centuries ago and very little people caucasian or not actually care for it kids dont think of it as racist as kids nor as adults whats the point of wanting to change it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i actually dont have an issue with this comment regulating sex work would lead to a lot less abuse
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet a white male wrote this
ShitRedditSays,removed,regulating prostitution would save the lives of so many women you asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not how arguments work but youre right men are a plague like women actually except not as emotionally unstable and better at sports pissing on the toilet seat growing beard hair getting banned on subs like this for having an actual civil argument not bleeding once a month and generally speaking heavy labor
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah sure thats totally how i came across very witty eat a snickers
ShitRedditSays,removed,banter you got there can i pls have some
ShitRedditSays,removed,your loss ¯ツ¯
ShitRedditSays,removed,my sense is telling me youre a woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure you can im not one for educating others though or running for that matter
ShitRedditSays,removed,i must say i really like that we spirit and ofcourse your ability to judge the physical fitness of people through the window that is your monitor now if youll excuse me i still have chesthair to scratch and beer to drink in my backyard while shielding my eyes with a sportsmagazine from the sunrays that are reflecting from my big tough pickup truck which totally has nothing to do with the size of a certain organ of mine
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the joke is that the second person takes the age as a rating based just on her looks and givers her instead for once paedophilia doesnt come into this
ShitRedditSays,removed,then why cant muslims and refugees be judged the same way
ShitRedditSays,removed,why dont they view it as white people tainting other races or whatever when interracial babies happen like why do the whites need to be the victim and not the minority also sense there are more whites they would be the predominant race component in the interracial dystopia they are so scared of
ShitRedditSays,removed,if that means getting rid of white male then so be it
ShitRedditSays,removed,whu drank my muther fuckin mountain dayum dew yu suns a bietches
ShitRedditSays,removed,i meanyeah id bang em both genuine displays of kindness give me a real chub i dont think thats a particularly psychotic way for my dick to behave either
ShitRedditSays,removed,art
ShitRedditSays,removed,test post pls ignore
ShitRedditSays,removed,you gave him a gold star good work
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree theyre not cutting off enough
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah how an out stop trying to make yourself out to be special by individualizing your gender doooooes your dick hang low does it wobble too and fro can you tie it in a knot can you tie it in a bow no then your a girl simple
ShitRedditSays,removed,gray asexual a decade duck off
ShitRedditSays,removed,not sure why anyone has an issue with uipwncarters comment its funny and its funny because its true
ShitRedditSays,removed,jerk why would an asexual be on tinder
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is really really specific could they also just be classified as really picky
ShitRedditSays,removed,you honestly think nonbinary gender is a legitimate thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you being sarcastic right now a trans woman is literally not the same thing as a natural woman why would anyone be classified as a nazi for their sexual preference
ShitRedditSays,removed,id like to listen and think for a second here why would a trans woman be considered to be literally the same as a cis woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,out of curiosity how is not being attracted to trans people make you a nazi
ShitRedditSays,removed,this post is turning me into a republican
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you admit that all of these new genders are akin to using a foreign language but most still get upset if you dont understand their new word of the day most mexicans wont throw a fit if you dont understand spanish they might find it humorous at most
ShitRedditSays,removed,this really isnt relevant here its actually pretty disgusting how you can compare people like that to nazis i live with other people we are males and a trans female none of us would ever date her nor do we find her attractive does this make us all nazis fucking nazis
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbf people are like this on both sides if it makes them look bad it must be true if it makes our side look bad it must be a setup
ShitRedditSays,removed,not reddit but just a redditor
ShitRedditSays,removed,relax guys this horrible racist strawman was a joke dont u guys have a sense of humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,that ellipses leaves out a ton of information
ShitRedditSays,removed,that nintendo feminist and rtheredpill agree on something christ people year old girls can be hot as shit its putting up with their personalities thats creepy in japan the age of consent is lower there are a lot fewer puritanical laws with regard to pornography and other forms of sex work and the incidence of violent sex crimes is way lower than that of the states muh christian cultural imperalism doesnt make a very compelling argument when women are actually safer in a society that allows the britneys and mileys of the world to not only look sexual but perform their sexuality in whatever way they want not only that but sexnegativity as it pertains to the greyarea of teenagers who are accountable legally for themselves in myriad ways is also contrary to feminism and intersectional politics in general reddits right get over it
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre a sad sad little man
ShitRedditSays,removed,j o k e
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not necessarily rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,for making a bad joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,blm is the westboro baptist church for canada this is so true
ShitRedditSays,removed,obese healthy pick one
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know what sarcasm is right he was being sarcastic because a bracelet telling someone not to rape them is not going to stop them from raping people still go in a zone
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do you assume its a womanit could be his son who is a ninja or a gay lover
ShitRedditSays,removed,you cant tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,much as i hate sounding like an antisocialjustice stereotype i think i might agree with them here obviously i hate how racist theyre being about it but i cant help feeling like this was essentially blm going shut up lgbt people were more important than you im sympathetic to their cause but i cant stand for silencing another minoritys voices in order to boost their own plz dont ban me
ShitRedditSays,removed,disgusting racism but i dont agree with blmto the answer to inclusion isnt further divisiveness you want more black representation thats totally fine but if you want safer communities for both black and lgtb members youre going to have to work together with police not plug your ears and stamp your feet like a child
ShitRedditSays,removed,they held things up for half an hour until they got the director to sign a contract that among other demands explicitly excludes police from future pride parades that contract is legally unenforceable but i find the fact that they would even make such a demand objectionable i agree that poc could do with more representation in these things but police have just as much of a right to that representation as they do
ShitRedditSays,removed,being this fat typical femtards
ShitRedditSays,removed,the whitest thing ive ever heard i was about to call this out as racism but you cant be racist against white people then again ive been collecting bans from sjw subs to put on my internet mantlepiece so i might as well pop in and say hi let me do my best impression of your average srser hhahaha guys am i enforcing the hatefilled circlejerk yet please let me virtual signal in this echo chamber because i have nothing else to fill up my empty life
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you think thats bad you should see the srsd and ainbow threads
ShitRedditSays,removed,i once went on a comedy website made in the that exclusively featured puns and i went out of my way to comment how bad each one was on every single post i felt pretty cultured afterwards because my sense of taste was much better than theirs
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do realize they werent even a thing until like years ago when it became a thing most women opposed it
ShitRedditSays,removed,foot fetishists are seriously gross
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you fat as well you are arent you
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont like how islam treats women generally
ShitRedditSays,removed,nobody cares what a neonazi has to say right back at you
ShitRedditSays,removed,id like you to admit that your system of labeling and segregating people doesnt always work
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you arguing against free speech
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a fact thats a myth stop reviveing the dead doctor
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this comment section full of feminist persons or are your sarcasm levels above average
ShitRedditSays,removed,even funnier considering the guy in that joke invented the lightbulb
ShitRedditSays,removed,when that woman outputs the same as that white shell be paid the same in a football team the one that scores more goals gets paid more reading most of the comments i concluded that they were not sarcasm so saying truth may get me banned
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not that bad that joke you quoted is it
ShitRedditSays,removed,q how many redditors does it take to come up with an original joke a ill let you know when they manage to do it q what do you get when you cross a redditor with a yeti a an abominable slow man
ShitRedditSays,removed,the woman if she does enter this career track will frequently be told to become a nurse anesthetist that is a sexist remark suggesting that women simplydo as they are toldwomen today are more than qualified to set their own career path
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a skeleton holding a dick and testicles like a sword on the top right of this subreddit where does that rank in grossness
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont get it
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you really did your research broheim this would be impressive if it werent so pathetic
ShitRedditSays,removed,well it doesnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh srss why are you always downvoted
ShitRedditSays,removed,good job invalidating oppression faced by trans men
ShitRedditSays,removed,only the ones with six packs pass for slave labour in our salt mines the ones with big dicks are chained up in the basement and used with whenever necessary the rest are ordinary slaves and perform everyday tasks such as acting as toilets for matriarchs sweeping the floor dragging carriages and respecting goddesses
ShitRedditSays,removed,not disagreeing with the point of your message but in my opinion its reasonable if some people really believe that we should try matriarchal societies in a larger scale for a change since patriarchy has had its violent turn
ShitRedditSays,removed,how about we stop pretending its a thing that only happens to trans people and just call it what it is bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,this thread looks like a saltmine
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes we do frequently and have throughout history as have many incredible women ive found its seldom to be seen in rjokes though bit of a low bar for intelligent commentary isnt this
ShitRedditSays,removed,its the internet and its a joke grow some thicker skin or just stay in your little social justice warrior safe space you people are like little babies crying when someone offends you in the slightest way not to mention you get offended by almost everything never fails to amaze me do you know what the majority of people do when they get offended they get the fuck over it because they are grown ups with bigger things to worry about then whether or not someone used one of your precious trigger words youre a joke and trust me not a funny one
ShitRedditSays,removed,man didnt that guy realize the pervasive cissexism in that comic what a hater
ShitRedditSays,removed,you seem to forget that there are terrible people in this world that are terrible just because they know how terribly you hate them being terrible acknowledging a troll only feeds it
ShitRedditSays,removed,does that mean that i sexually identify as a redditor s
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,i identify as an crisis battlesuit you fucking heliophobe
ShitRedditSays,removed,fucking male culture yes yes oh we have a fucking culture not only that but did you know we are all part of a hive mind that is dedicated to ruining the lives of women its
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound like you need a hug
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you have a source of lots of people on reddit saying that
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats pretty racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,well slam me in the memehole and lick my knob this is another spicy memerino from the subreddit which nobody knows if its real or not
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats because being male isnt a trait its being normal
ShitRedditSays,removed,if i wanted a copypasta id have wiped it off your chin
ShitRedditSays,removed,has anyone on this sub ever had consensual piv sex that wasnt rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,why have i made your space unsafe
ShitRedditSays,removed,but im saying shit on reddit isnt that what this sub is about
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh people like to masturbate women masturbate to women as well you know and if a person is willing to post a picture of herself online she might also be willing to post nudes most gonewild girls are active redditors and post in areas far outside that sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,how could you tell hes white
ShitRedditSays,removed,not all gamers are bad ya know
ShitRedditSays,removed,this guy may be in poor taste but why cant it just be a joke not like he is perving on her about posting some dirty pics is he
ShitRedditSays,removed,the scenario youre describing is exactly what regina george did to cady in mean girls when regina told cady that she wasnt allowed to date aaron because he was her ex and then she explicitly made out with and publicly got back together with aaron in front of cady and their classmates as a show of power to cady basically telling her you cant have him even if you both want each other because everyone knows that hes mine this is a very common situation and both men and women do these things to each other i dont understand why people have to pretend this a manspecific issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,like you
ShitRedditSays,removed,incarceration ruins lives and does nothing other than make people on the outside and not involved feel better
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not saying the racism doesnt exist but over of the us is white with wikipedia saying of course a majority of the people hold a majority of the capital
ShitRedditSays,removed,this comments section scares me it scares me that there are hundreds of thousands of social justice warriors acting without basic logic being incredibly vile and violent in private and public and making issues pit of nothing to further limit our free speech and expression
ShitRedditSays,removed,this video is stupid how is it productive to fight racism and sexism by instead generalizing an entire group of people
ShitRedditSays,removed,rprorevenge
ShitRedditSays,removed,funny you think theyd know better what dry cunts look like because i guarantee none of them have ever gotten a woman wet
ShitRedditSays,removed,id take the nazis over the jews any day of the week
ShitRedditSays,removed,or any goy with common sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,stormfront is kind of lame i prefer the daily stormer
ShitRedditSays,removed,i told you in thead that i wasnt talking about homeless people asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not something im hugely knowledgeable in if someone is willing to create a dialogue im totally open like i mentioned in my comment that was all just in my own view
ShitRedditSays,removed,apologies but im not entirely sure where youre going with that comment i agree with everything in it but im not sure how it really relates to what ive said
ShitRedditSays,removed,what white people rape too much so i guess brown people rape just enough and black people need to rape more thats how ridiculous you sound
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would have upvoted it too if it wasnt removed
ShitRedditSays,removed,such a shame your ben is coming so soon i have no idea what that means maybe you could translate i dont regret my past i did that yep i admitted it on a thread titled whats the most terrible thing youve ever done whats your beef with confession
ShitRedditSays,removed,on your translation or your answer to my question
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know its the name of a song from bloodhound gang and maybe if you look at the context you would see why bloodhound gang is the literal worst though
ShitRedditSays,removed,you need to chill the fuck out
ShitRedditSays,removed,lul they want the suffering to end because now theyre potentially going to be involved were this not the case cancelling the draft wouldnt even be on the feminist todo list
ShitRedditSays,removed,normally there are only your typical muri nonsense shit posts here but about this one im pretty pissed off that dude is insane
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think we all know who that guy had in mind when he said runs like a jamaican don quarrie fo sho
ShitRedditSays,removed,its pretty much true though isnt it
ShitRedditSays,removed,women are judged more by appearance men are judged more by personality and social standing
ShitRedditSays,removed,are people clamouring for it i havent heard any could you point me to a survey or something
ShitRedditSays,removed,it doesnt matter how it started blm is racist now just look at this video yeah thats a good way of putting it it started out being about the unjust slaying of blacks by white cops but then it went too far and got too reactive as social movements so frequently do and became just another hatefilled usversusthem movement have an upvote
ShitRedditSays,removed,its definitely full off censorship shouting down people who disagree with it often resorting to violence etc unempirical definitely its mostly social theoretics with no scientific or statistical measure most of the statements cannot be falsified verified or measured and there is a lot of motivated cognition unempirical motivated cognition is natural for any movement based on the interests of a group rather than a neutral basis
ShitRedditSays,removed,sick burn
ShitRedditSays,removed,any recommended readings
ShitRedditSays,removed,just wikipedia
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay got it but that is retarded and that does not look like a jellyfish
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats pretty fuckin racist dude
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats with it being okay to being openly racist towards white people around here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know no americanstarted war since vietnam used the draft wouldnt call them dignified whats dignified about rolling into a third world country with top class equipment fighting people shooting at you with wonky whats dignified about droning weddings
ShitRedditSays,removed,off to a great start with that ghostbusters movie 😷
ShitRedditSays,removed,sjw alert
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds like you need another bloodletting
ShitRedditSays,removed,its disgusting to see the amount of respect that some people have for pigs
ShitRedditSays,removed,just admit that is and example of female privilege
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub is against biology now too figures
ShitRedditSays,removed,you understand that men womens behaviors are in large shaped by hunter gatherer social dynamics if thats beyond your comprehension dont bother replying
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you asking what the linked comment means
ShitRedditSays,removed,men prove their value by providing safety and resources women prove their value by being viable child makers thats how mating goes beneath all of the added complexity of modern society oh slow one
ShitRedditSays,removed,so its not male privilege as long as both parties accept the deal women getting paid less than men isnt male privilege because those women accepted the pay they were offered
ShitRedditSays,removed,my matches would surprise you
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah just really really easy
ShitRedditSays,removed,mmmm delicious
ShitRedditSays,removed,youd have to be pretty damn stupid to not realize what her play was or youre just one of those gullible idiots im betting on the latter are you also a feminist did you wear your chastity cage today boy
ShitRedditSays,removed,man i think youre reading way too much into that interaction you know what tinder is right
ShitRedditSays,removed,ah a feminist no wonder youre a bit slow
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol the irony liberal cuck much
ShitRedditSays,removed,aww honey its okay youll learn eventually
ShitRedditSays,removed,i got a fever
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you want a cookie or something
ShitRedditSays,removed,women have always through all of human history been more effective providers than men women provide safety and resources men provide sperm theres a reason a healthy human population needs males should i wait for sources in neverland
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats funny i used to think this sub reddit was for stupidfunny stuff that people said on reddit now i see its just a bunch of feminist sjws that are just as bad about listening to other peoples opinion as rthedonald but of course they dont see it that way
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre a bit slow if you think shes not just trying to get guys to buy her and her friends free stuff
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know right imagine being somebody who doesnt go through reddit to find things that offends them so they can post to this subreddit to complain about that life must really suck
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh im sorry i forgot your special snowflake that lives in an echo chamber how rude of me to reply with my own opinion
ShitRedditSays,removed,when someones opening line is asking people to buy things for them its pretty easy to see what kinda person they are i dont know why youre being intentionally obtuse about this
ShitRedditSays,removed,women provide safety and resources how is this femalespecific it seems either sex could do this also you sound like a genocidal lunatic
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt come here looking for anything somebody linked to this subreddit in a comment and i thought id browse through it to see what kind of content it had im not offended by anything in here i just think its silly you guys go onto reddit it just to find things that youre offended by why torture yourself like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,their comment was deleted and im pretty sure youre full of shit youre basically saying that women did everything in primitive human society while men sat around and did literally nothing sorry if i find that hard to believe
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only reason men live anywhere near as long as women is because its useful to have old women in a population this doesnt make sense basically im calling you out because thinking of men as nothing more than sperm sacks is really horrible thing to say and makes you look like a piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,because shes using him for money and probably had no intention of dating him also its a joke calm down lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,im confused are you a dummy or are you agreeing with us
ShitRedditSays,removed,its money also its just a joke why do you overexaggerate so much
ShitRedditSays,removed,welcome to cucksville home of the cucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,of the time im on board with you all and there definitely is a ton of sexism in those comments but this is a well known tinder scam pulled off by manipulative chucklefucks of all genders if anyone actually believes she had any intention of going on a date with him ive got some bad news about the nigerian prince youve been sending money to
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol everyones talking about some imagined brigade or whatever rather than whats going on in the tinder messages
ShitRedditSays,removed,post this video on peoples facebook status in comedy views since oct ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh tbh i think the people on this subreddit are also pretty extreme just on the other end of the spectrum as the rest of reddit but id rather be exposed to both extremes than just one of them yknow
ShitRedditSays,removed,cold hard truth
ShitRedditSays,removed,rasanative
ShitRedditSays,removed,i disagree strongly nobodys just shitty thats way too simple of an explanation theres always more to it than that
ShitRedditSays,removed,its just the internet if you have a problem log off or close the window
ShitRedditSays,removed,real progress here wee little ones i love it
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry how is this a bad thing the poster explained the history of pepe and answered the persons question perfectly genuinely curious
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont ever go to japan youll lose your shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,ugh oh btw fucktard lets try to avoid ableism in our language here it can creep and and there are other issues but it certainly doesnt help
ShitRedditSays,removed,immediately closed the sub no thanks on seeing violence against my genitals in the icon
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a wonderful essay by george orwell somewhere where he proposes that ruling classes often arent actively malicious theyre just bumbling idiots
ShitRedditSays,removed,all white men working together in some conspiracy theyve all brushed up on their fran ansly and germaine greer to make sure none of their wishes become reality yeah right its more likely that theyre regurgitating brain dead arguments they hear on all them nasty subreddits and then circlejerking over how feminism cant be a force for good because they once met a feminist once at their community college and they were mean to them i mean if it is a conspiracy of all white men i never received an invite
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes pepe is obviously racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao whos talkin shit bout me imma whoop his ass lets go real quick and i dont play football
ShitRedditSays,removed,delet this
ShitRedditSays,removed,why the fuck are you catholic if you dont agree with their teachings you do realize that a core tenet is that the cc contains the fullness of truth right
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao you are exactly the type of uninformed christian that ratheism complains about
ShitRedditSays,removed,im gay george washington
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dunno some people just love to extrapolate from tiny sample sizes and use that to make sweeping generalizations when they bother to use accurate data at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,punching gay jews is ok as long as we call them fascists first
ShitRedditSays,removed,then dont basically no one is advocating for that
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only intolerance i see nowadays is by all of these names by the intolerant left
ShitRedditSays,removed,keep those blinders on
ShitRedditSays,removed,liberals in the us are the fascists and dont even realize it
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only intolerance i see is the exact reason i voted for trump
ShitRedditSays,removed,hillary was supported by extreme islamic countries she must hate gay people and womens rights obama was supported by the black panther movement so he must be against white people and wants apartheid where white people are oppressed groups supporting you doesnt make them automatically part of the group or the problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually those two claims are entirely consistent if you understand the argument lulz
ShitRedditSays,removed,the best thing ive ever seen if youre blind
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why its the divided states of america when even clinton sanders and obama say that it is time to stop dividing ourselves come together accept that trump is the president and see what he can do while voicing our opinion then you know its time to do those things im sorry but your hatred of trump supporters well after he won is just really toxic and reminiscent of how rthedonald was during the election season no need to stop that low
ShitRedditSays,removed,if done on purpose then shes just giving the audience what they want to seehear as always says more about the audience than the performer
ShitRedditSays,removed,most of its fine is it not i didnt look too deep but i expect your man this is why feminism is stupid comment but other than that these are mostly legitimate gripes
ShitRedditSays,removed,its very important for society to identify pedophiles and help them get rid of that feeling though imagine if all pedophiles got free therapy or something child molestation would be a thing of the past if a pedophile acts out on their feelibgs they belong in jail for the rest of their lives but having those feelings alone cant be a crime imo
ShitRedditSays,removed,while islam may not be a country it certainly is a nation
ShitRedditSays,removed,implying the two thoughts are mutually exclusive k
ShitRedditSays,removed,bernie supporter liberal proud feminist and activist for trans muslim and homeless rights i thought this joke was hilarious its just that overthetop dark kinda humor that made carlin ck and pryor some of the best comedians to ever live
ShitRedditSays,removed,idk i dont usually look for all demographic versions of the source i dont get upset that atticus finch was a white man or anything like that i dont go well wheres the story of a white man falsely accused of rape defended by black man i just enjoy things for what they are not what they arent
ShitRedditSays,removed,that statement carries implications not meaning to make implications not making implications
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyone knows that men cant experience sexism since they are part of the patriarchy
ShitRedditSays,removed,i want to pee outside in the open but society will never allow it
ShitRedditSays,removed,unprofessional box good fat sweet potatoes my ass
ShitRedditSays,removed,people are desperate enough to sell themselves for money and some people take advantage of them and enjoy it
ShitRedditSays,removed,except is actually is
ShitRedditSays,removed,mario seems to just absorb coins through his dermis and hat whereas the jews grab them with their stubby hairy paws
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you must be great at parties
ShitRedditSays,removed,to me it was i think it was funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre unfunny
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah actually yeah cause that shit didnt work at nuremburg and it aint gonna work now you dont just go and kill people to get a college education and its all alright cause of propaganda then again srs has always been as committed to antiimperialism as rkotakuinaction is to ethnical journalism
ShitRedditSays,removed,blame the officers not the soldiers
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,check out my sub rbandouchebagsandsjws i think youll like it
ShitRedditSays,removed,kill yourselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats classist and ableist
ShitRedditSays,removed,justice deserved
ShitRedditSays,removed,im in favour of eugenics if its on reddit users
ShitRedditSays,removed,who made the goods in the store who built the store fucking bourgies
ShitRedditSays,removed,can someone explain to me why its not natural selection not sealioning here i promise
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a great story that bitch got karma
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does it reek of borderline racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,did i watch the same clip as you that man was threatening the life of someone else trying to make a living the shopkeep had to decide if the robber was willing to kill him and make a decision on how to defend himself the other guy set the rules for the game he just ended it
ShitRedditSays,removed,uh
ShitRedditSays,removed,they called a robber subhuman just because he happened to be black doesnt mean its racist if i were the original commenter i would say the same if the robber had been white all trash either way
ShitRedditSays,removed,and i didnt say anything about that guy all i said was that the comment referenced in the title of this post was fine to use if the robber had been white or black
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit getting triggered from the word triggered how do you even function trigglypuff
ShitRedditSays,removed,just a sub full of witch hunting sjw
ShitRedditSays,removed,i came here from the trump sub to see if they responded to the pure ownage of course they didnt buncha faggy ass homos
ShitRedditSays,removed,nooo white females can be a wonder in the sack men of every color on the other hand i dont know how can you tolerate them
ShitRedditSays,removed,radiohead fans get beaten for enjoying musicdrinks during lent cant wait to read that one
ShitRedditSays,removed,someone needs to make a reality show where sjws go and live with the refugees they claim to love so much
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi sjws we cant downvote cause the srs admins get salty over their hurt feefees pull a trigglypuff tantrum have fun staying on reddit all day with your fempire downvote brigade tho we know you love that special treatment
ShitRedditSays,removed,radiohead is not a race
ShitRedditSays,removed,would you say that you are triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,easy with the christianphobic comments
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do females even function
ShitRedditSays,removed,that definitely never happened
ShitRedditSays,removed,shame all your compassion doesnt extend to the people getting raped and blown up all the time
ShitRedditSays,removed,well of course because women actually hold the most privilege in society because they hold all the power in dating and social situations and theyre all gold digging whores that just use men for their money and try to undermine them at every corner women are devils what issues with my mother no i have no idea what youre talking about
ShitRedditSays,removed,they seem to think the literary canon is predominately white and male because thats just the way the world works the white males are winning on merit stop complaining please
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,and feminists throwing around buzzwords dont
ShitRedditSays,removed,ha thatll show em hes a bieeeeegot
ShitRedditSays,removed,the nazis were the biggest democratically elected party however the antinazi parties combined were both bigger than them hitler only secured of the vote under normal circumstances this would not mean they would be able to form government and it probably would not have lead to him being elected or appointed chancellor however hitler was appointed chancellor however not because he won any sort of democratic mandate its widely accapted that this was a sly political menouver by the german ruling class to both try to coopt the nazi movement and to use them to clamp down on the communists and the left after hitler took power he passed a bunch of legislation giving him executive power and banning the opposition groups because he knew that if germany were able to have free and democratic elections he would be ousted so no youre wrong about the fact that hitler came to power democratically and wrong about the theory that had he not been appointed he wouldve won anyway more broadly youre wrong about how this has anything to do with the turkey example erdogan isnt a fascist the political and economic situation is not at the point where fascism is even on the agenda for the ruling class of turkey the only group that parliamentary democracy is under attack from at the moment is the military
ShitRedditSays,removed,always makes me sad to see an obese child the parents really need to get their shit sorted i dont see anything wrong with this
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love this idea opps i stepped in the wrong sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,antiracist is code for antiwhite
ShitRedditSays,removed,exactly all they wanted was peaceful protest asking for violence against wbc is silly
ShitRedditSays,removed,shit autism says
ShitRedditSays,removed,a group that wants less murder and violence by inciting murder and violence
ShitRedditSays,removed,black people are racist as fuck from my experience
ShitRedditSays,removed,yall wanna say something about my comment reply to it instead of hiding out on another sub dont think racism goes both ways then you are fucking ignorant to reality im a black man who has had to deal with his fair share of racism from whites hispanics asians etc ive seen it go both ways black to white hispanics to white asian to hispanic black to hispanic racism is racism regardless of either parties race its wrong and fucked the predominately black schools i went to had an issue with black to white racism to the point of attacks on other students for no reason other than some cop across the country shot someone or some other bs you have a problem with what i say say it to me and stop hiding in your tucked away shit hole
ShitRedditSays,removed,you reek of queef and loneliness
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah thats really not what i was trying to justify alcohol makes you extremely vulnerable both to internal and external influences predatory activity on drunk people of any variety is completely inexcusable but at the same time alcohol enables predatory behaviour in people who may otherwise suppress it
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are the laughing stock of reddit and one of the leastintelligent communities on here for your own honor just fucking delete this board already
ShitRedditSays,removed,so whats um whats the problem isnt this a pretty common thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah because the government chooses not to fund schools because there are blacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,i went to an almost entirely white school in the country there were a handful of black kids from the city that were relocated to a youth home in our school district to try to correct whatever trouble they got into in the city while i heard that a lot of the parents were up in arms about troubled youths placed in the same school as their children when the youth home opened i honestly cant remember ever hearing or seeing anyone harassing them over their race even when they werent around
ShitRedditSays,removed,as to the actual topic of that these holy crap thats really neat did she just dye one side of her hair howd she do that
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is this sub a place to kill clever jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,but thats how most articles paint them
ShitRedditSays,removed,cool knife muhammad want to bring it to the white house we should inspire more men like you to support the concepts of sharia law its what makes america great
ShitRedditSays,removed,accused
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub blows
ShitRedditSays,removed,still less creepy than purity rings and abstinence celebrations and daughters asking their daddy to a dance
ShitRedditSays,removed,banned from decent subs for posting in garbage subs other way around bucko
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs decent
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have wondered about something and this appears to be as good a place as any to ask about it how does the us compare to the rest of the world on immigration policies and restrictions is the us outrageously draconian and unreasonable foolishly naive and with out any limitations or somewhere in between
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i feel like you had one bad experience at tia several years back and are now basing your entire opinion on the current state of the sub off of it its not at all how you described the only thing that is accurate is that a lot of the people in the sub label themselves as liberal or moderate left or whatever people of all kinds of political and social leanings lurk and participate in that sub im personally very much leftleaning and libertarian and i love that sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,implying roffmychest is decent in any sense of the word
ShitRedditSays,removed,having to roll the windows down and crank the nonac cool setting on your heater must be so much worse than being murdered or having your family members andor friends murdered because of the color of their skin this comparison was never made where did you even get that from
ShitRedditSays,removed,otherkin and made up genders take the spotlight from people with actual gender dysphoria and for showing that we get blanket banned from free speech hating college crybabies because their feefees got hurt go back to your tumblr blog you fucking sjw
ShitRedditSays,removed,muslim is a race now are you a retard
ShitRedditSays,removed,well the confederate states did send delegates to pay for the federal land that the confederates acquired but lincoln refused due to the confederates not being a legitimate t government
ShitRedditSays,removed,rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,it really should never have been a thing back in the old days when it started people likened it to the thought police rightfully so too
ShitRedditSays,removed,all kidding aside you truly are horrible people and you should consider joining the human race you sometimes get your feelings hurt but in the long run youll be better off
ShitRedditSays,removed,your sarcasm doesnt hide your deeply felt sadness at the shitshow that is your life
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre a fucking liar white kids in black schools live in hell on earth every single goddam day
ShitRedditSays,removed,the voice of reason chimes in and no one bats an eye send them to iraq to remedy the male combat death inequality
ShitRedditSays,removed,i replied to another post but i will say it here again what about the tunisian male goatherder who has to herd his goats farther in order to bring them to water the fact of the matter is that it is asinine to claim it impacts one gender over another
ShitRedditSays,removed,way to stay on topic with this insightful comment anthropogenic climate change is everyones issue and no it does not impact women more than men
ShitRedditSays,removed,such as
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont view it as taboo to judge the effects a certain issue has on one gender versus the other for example sharia law in saudi arabia and other middle eastern countries very clearly impacts women more than it does men i do however believe that in the case of climate change it is nearly impossible to determine which gender is impacted more if one is greater then the other than it would be so minuscule that it wouldnt even make a difference in the big picture im not sure if you read the in question but it is about a team of all women scientists embarking on an expedition to the antarctic to study climate change this is something i can get behind as an issue that actually faces women the lack of women in stem related jobs
ShitRedditSays,removed,just checking
ShitRedditSays,removed,that guys getting banned from something he doesnt visit thatll show him
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy fuck some people are absolute edgelords httpsteamcommunitycomidwithextrafoam
ShitRedditSays,removed,if he was drinking as well then who would be to blame if they both drank then neither could give consent would he still be the rapist and her the victim
ShitRedditSays,removed,you got that mixed up altrighters just simply dont give a fuck what anyone says and they want you to equally not give a fuck what they say
ShitRedditSays,removed,the farleft likes to dabble in mccarthyism while the farright is busy blowing up the migrant crisis and defending white nationalism this is why i sit back and watch people fight among themselves and solve fuck all
ShitRedditSays,removed,honest question i was picked up by a girl once she was really drunk grabbing my crotch in the bar invited me back to her place within a half hour of meeting her if i agreed to have sex with her is that rape i was also drunk probably too drunk did i get raped
ShitRedditSays,removed,nothing you people do is awesome
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt trans just how you relate to the two genders that exist and not another gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,read about the rape of nanking and unit
ShitRedditSays,removed,head stripper is not even a thing which is partly why this was posted in rthathappened
ShitRedditSays,removed,some feminists are smart and by some i mean like percent i will be awaiting your ban i love getting banned from idiotic subreddits
ShitRedditSays,removed,feminism is a stupid belief and genders beside male and female are not genders but mental disorders
ShitRedditSays,removed,the irony
ShitRedditSays,removed,go through my post history i am mentally ill
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know what i got from that comment specifically is that radical islam is something to hatefearwhatever and it is it doesnt seem like its a racist statement at all especially with recent events its only natural for people to hate radicals right now plus he only mentions terrible events sometimes it feels like people are more worried about sounding racist instead of giving support to the victims of these terrible attacks we should be far more involved in trying to be supportive than being careful of phrasing things to not offend people by insulting radicals of any group bigger picture stuff
ShitRedditSays,removed,it makes no difference if they go down to be honest none of the bigots and assholes who supposedly left for voat actually left i have seen this statement written in thedonald and european and their other shitty subs over and over again voat is fine as an echo chamber but we need to take over reddit and pump those liberal subs full of propaganda everyon on voat has a reddit account and posts here too the difference is they use voat to say the kinds of things that would force the admins to shadowban them on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre missing the point
ShitRedditSays,removed,rnews definitely shot themselves in the foot with that ridiculous deleting though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean the fact is actions have consequences and it was stupid for her to go to such a dangerous place im jewish and i wouldnt dare go to palestine wearing a yamaka i know better while what happened to this woman is horrible and the assailant should be rightfully punished it wont happen because qatar follows the hanbali interpretation of sharia law
ShitRedditSays,removed,that means nothing he was probably heading to pickup his friend for a range day
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah but from the comment its hating radical islam it even says so in the comment itself its an assumption this person is islamophobic from saying turns out islamic radicals give us a lot to fear they point out radical
ShitRedditSays,removed,this may not be the place to discuss this but a genuine question does intent factor into this i remember as a kid albeit only so we didnt have the concept of sex much my male friends would all pants each other and it was just a funny prank but i pantsed a girl and that was a big deal and i was told it was different to be clear pantsing boys at that time was not seen as bad at all so i just didnt realize it could offend someone more than being mildly embarassing i definitely wasnt sexually harassing her in intent but i realize it could have looked like that i didnt pull down underpants either but i always felt a little raw that everyone freaked out when otherwise it was a harmless prank to me i feel bad for his brother but also wonder if while the other kid is a jerk maybe it wasnt about sexual humiliation as much as just being a really dumb prank and maybe shouldnt be considered sexual harassment they are a bit old to not realize that shit though so who knows the guy seemed way too into vengeance for my taste regardless of if it was sexual harassment i guess my childhood was a bit unique as i was actually sexually harassed by a similarly aged child she required that i have sex with her which in our mind was peeing near each other or staying naked near each other for minutes to play road rash on her snes so i never really saw sex as very interesting outside of getting what i wanted video games as a kid nor really saw girls as that different than boys so im a bit confused as to whether or not i have a misguided idea of what these things really imply im definitely not trying to say pantsing a year old is good behavior i can definitely see that as bullying at the least but im just not sure if id consider that sexual harassment as im not sure if that is something they considered sexual as in certain areas againshowing my ignorant upbringing where homosexuality wasnt even considered where a guy doing that to another guy would be assumed as nonsexual in intent either way the kid should at the least be punished for bullying
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay that was kind of funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,the article was but not the comment i thought this subreddit was to judge what redditors say i was discussing the comment and it really seems like he was just pointing out radicals which would then not be islamophobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,your statement doesnt disprove my point it only give an example of a time when religious refugees came to america and brutally ravaged the local population
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one likes the truth here
ShitRedditSays,removed,these people dont like facts here its just cancer all the way down
ShitRedditSays,removed,just got banned from ghazi after making a post saying im muslim dont know much about the sub i assumed it was a srsoffshoot based on the content anyone know whats up with that place
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i dont disagree that reddits response is shit in generali just wanted to know i thought it might be better for srsdiscussion but found the on topic post posted it here there seems to be some significant disagreement just within this thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,i too am genuinely oblivious as to why this statement is something to post in here please educate me
ShitRedditSays,removed,omar mateen murdered people and injured another are you surprised hes dominating the news
ShitRedditSays,removed,keep watching sissy videos bruh
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean like srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually white trans males will be permitted during the early stages of the purges

ShitRedditSays,removed,kill all cis white males
ShitRedditSays,removed,shut up
ShitRedditSays,removed,whoa dude you better cut that hate speech out or you might spook our dearest and most valuable allies on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,are they wrong no theyre not
ShitRedditSays,removed,when youre accustomed to privilege token minority representation feels like oppression equality is basically the death star blowing up alderaan but its some kind of enormous black vagina instead of a ball
ShitRedditSays,removed,then i thought why the fuck do i care im not playing as myself so its not like the guy needs to look like me since when is customisation a bad thing though theres been createapro in fifa for years why shouldnt people want to play as an asian man with a giant ginger afro i get that it doesnt work for all games you cant exactly play lara croft as a stone black man but fifa doesnt exactly have that
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realize the picture is of a transmission made into a sink right its all really shitty puns with no intention of being malicious holy shit does this kind of stuff go over all of your heads
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh im sorry i forgot im not allowed to equally make fun of this kind of topic like i would with anything else simply because it could hurt someones feelings you realize that the basis of most humour is having fun with scenarios and ideas that people can find relatable if you all want the lgbtq movement to integrate and become a part of society as a whole then you have to allow it to be subjected to the same banter that everyone else is accustomed to receiving this little protective ball that you put yourselves into only serves to isolate yourself more from day to day life
ShitRedditSays,removed,no gendered slurrr pls thx
ShitRedditSays,removed,i havent heard of anyone who would say they do unless they were joking
ShitRedditSays,removed,its called dark humor its not fro everyone but its how some people cope with the dark shit in the world its not condoning the behavior or saying anything good about it the fill up with sand comment was actually a reference to a comic strip about cavemen supposedly dragging women by their hair some people just laugh into the abyss especially on wtf
ShitRedditSays,removed,cmon fam that attitude doesnt get us anywhere not denying most are but im pretty sure srs alone is like white dudes
ShitRedditSays,removed,wohooooo i know this is a bad comment but honestly the shit that gets posted on here is too funny i bet you people couldnt write jokes as funny as this comment this some shit you would hear come out of micheal scotts mouth
ShitRedditSays,removed,no no no you dont understand doctors wear those coats because they have to hide the fact that theyre actually ninefoottall lizard people i mean gosh if you even listened to alex jones you would know the truth s
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you sure theyre not agreeing with the fact that the movie was shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just an outsider peeking into this little world it seems like there are some of you who spend their entire lives looking for things to be angry about the world is and forever shall be inhabited by mostly horrible people it almost feels childish the amount of effort you guys put into exposing it
ShitRedditSays,removed,for someone concerned with social justice you are plainly and grotesquely racist i know about your ignorant narrative about it being impossible to be racist against white people it must suck living in a constant state of outrage at perceived inferiority well maybe it isnt so much perceived as it is actual inferiority judging by your words
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive never heard anyone under the age of say that women are to stay at home and look after the kids less women would stay at home if society didnt have such a negative attitude to stayathome dads also blatant misandry
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought i read it phrased like that in a medical textbook but im not a good source
ShitRedditSays,removed,china seems like a great place no one will even help her because they will probably be punish for doing so we are totes losing to them
ShitRedditSays,removed,the region that they are from condoning that kind of violence why did the man following them not try to stop him
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats boatist
ShitRedditSays,removed,how fucking dare they make jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fuck reddit its just a cultural difference quit being islamaphobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,could you tell me why it was good
ShitRedditSays,removed,those are some really good reasons as to why it isnt complete shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand this sub at all but just saying transgenders have far higher rates of other defined mental disorders than other population groups so i can see some people claiming it is a mental disorder just due to the result of it correlating to so defined mental disorders
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop being a twat your comments have no common theme from which i could glean
ShitRedditSays,removed,as i said im talking more about the large portion of society not in poverty who are overweight and obese and have access to the resources to change that
ShitRedditSays,removed,racist fuckhead however im keeping the term basketball americans
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes youre probably right the us situation sounds difficult for those in poverty but when it comes to obesity in the middle class my point still stands i can look up us supermarket prices if you like i doubt theyd prove me wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,you dont need feminism because any man can be an authentic woman if they just believe themselves to be
ShitRedditSays,removed,just eat less then lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a stupid thing to say
ShitRedditSays,removed,you and everyone in this thread are redditors
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is a difference between saying all black people are like that and saying that this person who also happens to be black is like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,discrimination the chinese are not a race ps if your flair is supposed to be latin then albus populo should be changed into albo populo if you mean to say that the greatest good is exterminated by white people however if you want to say that the greatest good is the extermination of white people which would be racism because white people are unlike the chinese a race then it should be albi populi genitivus thanks the albus populus
ShitRedditSays,removed,trap and trans are quite different trap refers to a feminine man usually extremely sexual and wearing female clothing if you didnt know they were a man youd think they are a women therefore called a trap what you fucking idiots are crying over is trans people traps are called traps and not trans because traps dont identify as anything else except for their birth gender while trans people identify as whatever they are changing too traps are usually seen as a sexual sense because traps are sexual things done by men for almost always sexual purposes trans people are different i hope i pcd my comment enough for you fuckers
ShitRedditSays,removed,blacks forfeit the right to live when they cant even show minimum respect for authority they get rightfully shot
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is the worst echo chamber i have ever seen
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub is literally full of tumblr fags
ShitRedditSays,removed,im conflicted here i used to use the word retarded all the time when i was a kid it felt really descriptive now i use stupid because im an adult and dont want to run around offending people but should it be offensive it still feels like a really descriptive word to me and i think the context in which its said should be considered the thing is i think theres a difference between saying something in ignorance and exaggerating for comedic effect as the guy in the image is saying for instance i have depression and when someone says ive been depressed before but then i got over it it makes me want to punch them because they dont understand what theyre talking about but if someone says ugh that makes me so depressed its not because they dont understand the condition theyre exaggerating its a joke really i dont know what to think
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop femsplaining me jeez you mind not being so patronizing
ShitRedditSays,removed,i do agree that black people in general are disadvantaged but only because they are the majority in poor urban areas i believe that poor urban folk are looked down upon not because of their race but because of their socioeconomic status therefore because of the correlation between the two people associate black with poor and make assumptions that way in other words i have a hypothesis that if a proportionally equal amount of whites and blacks were poor and the same proportion existed in middle class and rich people institutional racism would be virtually nonexistent therefore i think it is important to help raise up poor inner cities not because they are black but because they are poor misattributing the problem to race is generalizing a lot
ShitRedditSays,removed,the reason theyre in poor urban areas is because of the extreme racism that existed in the past that no longer exists poor urban areas need to be lifted up completely blind to race
ShitRedditSays,removed,tldr people cant tell satire from reality
ShitRedditSays,removed,he doesnt rip off people yeah he raised the price of medicine but he did that to screw over the insurance companies anyone who cant afford the medicine gets it for free and insurance companies have to pay for it
ShitRedditSays,removed,not as fucking stupid as you since you dont realize how insurance works
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously do you think that type of rhetoric helps your cause in any way because i dont recall any woke people helping me out the last time i cooked at the homeless shelter many of us white men actually do in fact feel empathy and some of us do more than sit behind a keyboard and complain about shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,male shelters arent really a necessity
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow really is that all you got try again when you have something actually relevant to the subject at hand
ShitRedditSays,removed,look at my post history i made a comment calling out a racist this morning i dont see why i should be seen as a virtue signaller or as another racist redditor when theres proof im not i try my best to shut down racists and misogynists and fail alot of the time becuase reddit is shit but yet im still responsible for every white guys racism its irritating
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre not getting what im saying i dont even know what sea lioning is it can be funny when theres humour ive upvoted funny stuff before thats about white people its not that im offended at all about people making jokes its that when people seriously act and imply that all white people are racist that its annoying when its a joke it can be funny if done right when its serious its annoying as fuck when you get sent shitty pms all the time from racists becuase youre an srs poster its a bit irritating to get serious comments saying that just because im white im as bad as the racists
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just knew id be seeing this thread in here the problem is these robots have had so little human interaction that they dont really have any experiences from which to draw empathy from fuck ive been on a date with a girl before and it was going badly not that she was crazy or rude or anything there just wasnt any chemistry and it was painful for both of us id have paid good money for a service like this to escort us both away painlessly
ShitRedditSays,removed,literally every girl i know has multiple stories about dealing with weirdos and complete strangers who think theyre entitled to fuck cos they said hello most of them have had to deal with psycho exes at some point and one or two even had legit stalkers i really cant blame a woman for being apprehensive around guys tbf
ShitRedditSays,removed,blatantly racist shitbags on twitter
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre going to have a difficult life if this offends you misgendering though where
ShitRedditSays,removed,he is literally a man he will always be a man nothing you say can do anything about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,shit man is dark humor just completely shunned here i thought he was clearly joking
ShitRedditSays,removed,a joke on a subreddit about jokes how could they just the patriarchy at work damn white males
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the hangup on phenomena such as mansplaining are just wounded pride nobody likes to have their noses rubbed in their ethical inadequacy and i believe a big part of leftist politics in this century will have to be about how to get people to listen without estranging them through adversarial subtext
ShitRedditSays,removed,but she wasnt being harassed he said his name was hugh mungus shes just an idiot for freaking out over it
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this in any way bad i havent played with bubbles or playdoh since kindergarten college students should seek professional help if they need help with their lives not this
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit isnt one group give mind or religion some parts are extremely pc and many arent it depends where you are and who you are talking to
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a joke learn to laugh
ShitRedditSays,removed,islam is a very extreme religion terror doesnt come from nowhere and to deny that it comes from islam and muslims an overwhelming amount of the time is dishonest not to mention genital mutilation the treatment of women the treatment of homosexuals and the treatment of nonmuslims in majoritymuslim countries also can somebody explain to me what shown here was racist as said by other people in the thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre putting a lot of words into that quote as far as ive seen there only are two genders male and female provide a source for another one and then that will be considered invalid but if you dont identify as either male or female the two genders then you arent gendered that means there are only two genders provided that there isnt proof for any other ones
ShitRedditSays,removed,god damnit youre a damn asshole ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,smfh dude its a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,just like that giant white font everyone keeps using on this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,i see a comical video of two morons arguing i cracked up a few times actually
ShitRedditSays,removed,black peoole sure are scared easily asian peoole sure are scared easily hispanic peoole sure are scared easily filipino peoole sure are scared easily indian peoole sure are scared easily native american peoole sure are scared easily why is one ok and the rest arent i dont like double standards
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is and thats bullshit women talk to men as if they know nothing about tons of shit child rearing housekeeping emotions etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes courts do it all the time when they give women preferential treatment in custody proceedings
ShitRedditSays,removed,what are you talking about
ShitRedditSays,removed,great and i as a man dont need a woman to explain to me how to clean a house or raise a child yet it happens and we only ever hear about mens evil doingwhy
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh my god grow up
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope she doesnt end up whining on reddit about minor things that happened years ago
ShitRedditSays,removed,is that really necessary may i remind you that this is after a debate not watching their parents die i dont think that any of this should be needed in college
ShitRedditSays,removed,no im assuming it because we as people make schemas in life that help us identify and navigate through it if i know youre into construction and stuff then its unlikely im going to over explain what im talking about if i think you seem lost by what is being discussed im going to explain it not to be condescending to be polite
ShitRedditSays,removed,it obviously depends on where you move around countries as a whole have averages of then you get a closer look into cities and the average of muslim population rise to in given areas and im not talking about big cities like say brussels or madrid just normal sized towns inhabitants usually in city suburbs
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not going to read your again huffpo article as like usual its highly biased but youre wrong about why women spend more time with their children in the formative years men were not allowed to take maternity leave they had to work while women were able to stay home and spend time with their child for some reason this got turned into women do more with the child meanwhile its a completely equal relationship without dad bringing home money mom certain cant feed baby as for you wondering about mansplaining being done to demean its done because of a belief that the man knows more about a given topic despite having no reason to believe that is the case my mother is a nuclear engineer and spent many years specializing in electrical engineering even among people who should know who she is she still has to put up with being talked down to by men with a tiny fraction of the education and experience and this is not even remotely unique to her situation actually i think youre not understanding there is a reason to assume women dont know as much in the field thats because most women are not interested or in the field
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think we shouldnt say that about any culture guess thats not a popular opinion
ShitRedditSays,removed,o m g t r i g g e r e d o m g t r i g g e r e d
ShitRedditSays,removed,is that meant as a huge compliment towards sjw because while i disagree with her think she is way overreacting and not being constructive in anyway if the most disgusting part of something you can find is someone being rude and telling you that you are offensive this thing must be down right amazing
ShitRedditSays,removed,that woman in the video is ridiculous lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,rape culture doesnt exist and feminism is pointless
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank god my obvious sarcasm has got your approval
ShitRedditSays,removed,or made a joke regardless how tasteless it might be that made some people laugh
ShitRedditSays,removed,ya pc brah xddxdxdxdxdxdxdxd
ShitRedditSays,removed,sure go ahead lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do you know the commenter is a white boy
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit people like you really do exist this is literally the most ignorant thing i have ever seen on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre a fucking idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,what makes you think hes white mate
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol the way you kowtow over a completely innocuous misphrasing is cute
ShitRedditSays,removed,country full of cucks thats why
ShitRedditSays,removed,really so why do individuals like james holmes and dylan roof have who have literally kill people but they get arrested alive yet the police shoot and kill black people who havent done much of anything it cant be racism because that died with mlk not sexisme because bitches make that ups
ShitRedditSays,removed,today rshitredditsays branded mlk as a racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,my girlfriend keeps harassing me because i told her i woke up with period all over me that my cat peed on the carpet and that i am very desperate for corned beef but have to find a new grocery store because the deli guy is infatuated with me at my local sprouts her death draws near
ShitRedditSays,removed,race is not the important thing here i think the whole issue could be addressed by just calling her iron millennial
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre right theres male female and mentally ill
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would that even be considered edgy there are two sexes so it would make sense if there are two genders if you dont feel like you are a man or a woman there is something wrong with you in my opinion and in most of the worlds opinion just saying youre a carrot doesnt make you a carrot
ShitRedditSays,removed,everybody with different political views as me is wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is no difference between them in my native language
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a fucking downvote party invite your friends you cisgendered shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol what a cuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay but i would legitimately like to know the racial part of all those statistics as well
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha yeah hour working weeks is just being handed things to me on a silver plate
ShitRedditSays,removed,so is the bpt post on the front page racist or is it cool because theyre white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,so when kaepernick protests something that he believes is wrong its cool and so very brave but when a group of police officers protest something that they believe is wrong its atrocious
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol that is such a double standard they are literally doing the exact same thing that kaepernick is doing peacefully protesting they have no obligation to work a private event like an nfl game the stadium will just have to contract out the event to a private security company theyre not putting anyone at risk by choosing to protest you realize thats why unions were created right or are you against unions too you are making ridiculous assumptions to support your narrative im not picking sides here but the police deserve the same rights as every other citizen
ShitRedditSays,removed,they have no obligation to work an nfl game do you really think that the stadium would just not hire any security if the police department refused to work the event its not like they wouldnt respond to an emergency at the stadium if something were to happen its not like theyre refusing to uphold the law in the city you realize thats why we have unions right
ShitRedditSays,removed,double standards are fun this subreddit has just as many hateful ignorant morons as rthedonald quit thinking youre any better than them
ShitRedditSays,removed,rcalloutableists should be bigger
ShitRedditSays,removed,right wouldnt want to disrupt the echo chamber you idiots have going on
ShitRedditSays,removed,if anyone uses mass tagger etc ive uploaded new sets to httpsgithubcombizinessrestags im open to future suggestions i figure ill run scripts once every couple months please note as ive said on github there are false positives i might eventually write a script better than what im currently using
ShitRedditSays,removed,the first guy was an asshole but im pretty sure the second guy was making fun of the first with the i love boing white statement
ShitRedditSays,removed,or maybe we could i dunno make some kind of system where child support isnt needed and that people are not punished for honest mistakes also a simple blood test can disprove paternity so its trivial to figure out if the child is yours or not even before it is born i do agree with the german idea of having a person name all potential fathers if they are seeking out child support though
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol your apology really meany something
ShitRedditSays,removed,lpt if you hate reddit so much then leave
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbf didnt lena dunham rape her sister or something
ShitRedditSays,removed,very representative evidence you have there what a reasonable sample size you used to come to your conclusion
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are different kinds
ShitRedditSays,removed,all backs are racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,usually people who identify as otherkin are teenagers or have some sort of disorder but aside from that just guess wherewho the joke originated from ill give you a clue it rhymes with hansphobic sitstain
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just saying i know you guys are extreme in this but i cant be liberal and have a good joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not innocent of this making a brrtbrrrrtbrrrrrrrt joke at one point but fuck innovate a bit choose an abrahams tank for a change keep the jokes fresh at least
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats getting saved as a res macro
ShitRedditSays,removed,if he didnt say yes then it was rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hate the smell of other peoples shit but for some reason i cant help but roll around in it and inhale deeply
ShitRedditSays,removed,i had no idea ethnic swedish people were physically incapable of gang rape i guess that means all of that freaky swedish porn is a lie then theyve been using finnish actors all along
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not mowing people down if you just inch forward at a few mph serious questions have you even ever been in an extremely dangerous fight or flight situation better yet do you even have a family or someone you would do anything to protect
ShitRedditSays,removed,interesting video thanks for linking that being said what are your thoughts on the idea that if women are paid less for the same work then one could literally save money by hiring only women i am not wellversed in the progressive sphere or whatever prosrs people call themselves i really have no idea and i just searched for debunking only hiring women and cant find anything on that i mean we know there are people who are okay with so there doesnt seem to be much of a case for anything being too terrible for anything to think of profiting from it consequently surely there are people who would be ready to only hire women or somehow use this earnings differential to make money heck one could even pay women more than they currently make and still come out ahead it seems to me that would be the perfect thing to point to as an example of the gender pay gap to those who deny it look it works
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds like they speak from experience
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait why is the commenter assumed to be a white male unless theres something in user history im supposed to be aware of
ShitRedditSays,removed,who said anything about this being a male
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont want to get into a whole thing but i would like to point out that the person was actually a girl
ShitRedditSays,removed,the user is in fact a girl
ShitRedditSays,removed,we should kill everyone who disagrees with us or looks different only way to be sure
ShitRedditSays,removed,i prefer the post with sources
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have to agree i like that as well ¯ツ¯
ShitRedditSays,removed,dallas was a feel good story
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is cancer a man and women in the same job will earn the same money sorry to say it but its like this in every single first world country what feminists should be targeting is the disgusting way women are treated in world countries this point alone is why most of the world compares modern day feminism to the absolute worst kind of cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,the first step was schumers disgusting swimsuit thing now shes sleeping with movie critics this has to stop
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a dangerous circlejerk vaccines are great but they are not miraculously great i wasnt vaccinated well i was once cue severe allergic reaction off we go to the icu for days doctors denied it could have been caused by vaccines because vaccines are gospel obviously insisted i have my other shots parents said no way got cps called on my family too a couple years later because i went to school without my shots vaccines are godsent everyone must have them all even after it was proven it could kill some people natural selection yo this is what this circlejerk will lead to
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do you come to reddit if you hate reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,clutches pearls those god damn violent nig thugs
ShitRedditSays,removed,please forgive me for momentarily breaking the circlejerk but i was wondering could someone please explain what was shit about this its a common criticism of clinton that she is dishonest
ShitRedditSays,removed,hm i think its a joke though
ShitRedditSays,removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,caps locks means youre angry grrr
ShitRedditSays,removed,heaven forbid someone uses that highway to get somewhere like a hospital job interview or a funeral no but fuck those people its not like theyve ever blocked ambulances or anything
ShitRedditSays,removed,standard dindu nuffin mayo boys should all be removed from society nothing is ever their fault its all the false rape accusations
ShitRedditSays,removed,im convinced that one of the main reasons cis men hate trans people is castration anxiety not to mention the fact that you dont cut it off you turn it inside out sorta
ShitRedditSays,removed,so this entire sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,sure are a lot of dindu nuffin apologists in that thread goddamn
ShitRedditSays,removed,castration anxiety refers to the feeling that ones masculinity is literally or figuratively threatened its possible that trans people make cis guys uncomfortable because the idea that anyone could ever feel dissatisfied with being male and want to transition makes them start to question their own arbitrary masculinity and thus feel insecure but of course that would only be a small part of the whole thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,off hand i dont really feel like this belongs here but thats when i compare it to some of the other actual true shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not what the person responding to you was talking about she was talking about eyewitness testimony to crime in general and its potential applicability to rape cases youre creating a straw man and arguing that acquaintance rape is the only violent andor sexual crime where eyewitness testimony would be used and therefore it should be trusted completely youre wrong and every expert in this field would disagree with you
ShitRedditSays,removed,❈
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhjzqpcvkrgo
ShitRedditSays,removed,call it what you like but if i caught you with my year old daughter you would be carrying your balls home in a jar
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry but it is gross a year old cant consent to sex period that doesnt change with the age of the partner
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is completely right from the time that transgender female mma fighter fucking destroyed their first opponent to when men dressed as women beat women in races at the end of the day its a man with his cock and balls removed which are his biggest weaknesses its the perfect killing machine
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree and im and kilos
ShitRedditSays,removed,op of that post please unironically die this is the kind of things people think when they believe autismspeaks propaganda
ShitRedditSays,removed,by the power of testosterone i am heman cue cartoon rock
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry if this triggers you but op is not white also chinese tourists have such a bad reputation that their government has released statements asking them to be more respectful when traveling internationally furthermore referring to chinese nationals as poc as if theyre an underprivileged minority is ridiculous they represent almost a fifth of the global population and are from one of the most powerful countries in the world
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have no idea what you just said
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have no idea what you just said
ShitRedditSays,removed,thought this was a pretty egregious case of racism and a non political sub dae blacks commit crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,ah thats what you get when someone relies upon the facts in the national crime victimization survey
ShitRedditSays,removed,moron is very offensive to morons have a heart and dont be so edgy lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,i legitimately hate fat unathletic peoplei dont need a reason to hate them for it at utc exxaxion replied to these whats your excuse posts are cancer while i legitimately hate fat unathletic people its still their motherfucking right to be like that they dont need an excuse to be fat just like i dont need an excuse to hate them for it httpiimgurcomtjjuqmgpng
ShitRedditSays,removed,love the mass of downvotes in this swineforsaken subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,as much as i like your pastas you should probably mix it up a little bit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think im missing the connection between this and the post also do you really encounter men who dispute this information ive certainly never seen a single person try and dispute that crime is dominated by men
ShitRedditSays,removed,but if they say its a conspiracy it must be true right
ShitRedditSays,removed,well if they browsed this subreddit i certainly wouldnt blame them i mean ive been browsing here for like minutes and it seems like every other post has a white men are terriblerapistscriminalsbrainless comment with plenty of upvotes i suppose this community isnt too concerned with how its perceived but it seems terribly ironic how tia is ragged on here i agree that theyre a bit dense when they believe crazy outliers and troll posts represents an entire group but a lot of the comments by folks in this sub would fit perfectly among the crazies and fake posts maybe thats not everyone but its kind of cringe seeing people shame entire groups of people all while engaging in similar behavior
ShitRedditSays,removed,no i know a lot of it is sarcasm and i dont think people care about that im not not talking about the joke comments im talking about the long rants where someones jimmies got really rustled
ShitRedditSays,removed,in the uk travellers gypsies have a bad reputation because they are often criminals pay no tax and illegally set up their camps on peoples land im not sure if its the same case on the continent or not
ShitRedditSays,removed,if im reading this tweet correctly hes saying that blacks commit an overwhelming amount of violent crimes in major cities and that unrelatedly the tough subject of hispanics must be discussed
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is an abelist slur
ShitRedditSays,removed,ehh i kind of see your point but i think hes faced criticism from people who feel he presents a simplified version of the issues and uses a snapshot appeal to emotion approach
ShitRedditSays,removed,but he said that they did do bad things he didnt say that they werent bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,if the average american woman was a size then the average piece of clothing would be a size clothing operates on a simple supply and demand model the demand drives the supply not the other way around this isnt a shadow conspiracy levied against fatties by a network of fatphobic nazis theyre just catering to their largest consumer base i am a shorter man which means i have trouble finding clothes that fit me but im not a victim i just put a little more effort into shopping and have a good tailor thats the price you pay when you are outside of the average at least fat women can lose weight i cant grow
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think thats what they were trying to say honestly
ShitRedditSays,removed,these kinds of people just like the victimdefender relationship they need to fall into one of these categories in every aspect of their life they do not represent and should not be confounded with any of the causes they claim to take part into they only hijack them sums you up srs get a grip
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey dummy thats a quote from frank reynolds in an episode of always sunny where they debate whether blackface is racist or not the kid in that picture deserves a beating
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think this is a joke about transgender people rather its about people who identify as dragonkin etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the idea is if companies dont produce extra large clothing people will be less willing to overeat and gain weight
ShitRedditSays,removed,apparently your username is referencing a rather specific version the most personally offensive version that i can get all upset about is usually the one im going to assume
ShitRedditSays,removed,i broke a rule by defending their joke so im deleting my previous reply to you my apologies
ShitRedditSays,removed,the point of the thread is actually its inclusion in a sub all about the dumb things people do you saying that referencing this kid and his decision to dress up in blackface and throw around epithets is somehow condoning is ridiculous by that logic every post in shitredditsays is also condoning the shit that reddit says do you really not understand that face palm is a place to put things that arent good
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre some stupid motherfuckers
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you serious the guy who said it in the show was mocked for being being a racist idiot the purpose of that scene was to mock people that say stuff like that but sure just get offended instead
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was one of the people who downvoted you not because i support nazi ideology but because your whole rant is pointless
ShitRedditSays,removed,how delightfully myopic so because you dont like something it is right wing
ShitRedditSays,removed,bahahahahahahahah those guys have a hell of a victim complex
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you just speak to me in a demeaning manner
ShitRedditSays,removed,i say we give these redditors their wish so long as they meet the conditions of the end of world war which is to say they will be marched to be tried in the hague after which they will be marched to the gallows
ShitRedditSays,removed,you get that this is sarcasm right
ShitRedditSays,removed,not helping what
ShitRedditSays,removed,voat for the nonbrainwashed
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry to upset you fat fucks 😂😂😂😂
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought it was pretty funny but then again im not an uptight overprivileged tumblrina that needs to look for reasons to be offended on the internet
ShitRedditSays,removed,heeyyyy look at that this subreddit is cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you personally looked into any of the evidence
ShitRedditSays,removed,where does it say that they were manipative or abusive im not saying that the older boyfriend isnt at fault too but that comment was specifically about the girl accusing her music teacher do you honestly think she didnt ruin his life
ShitRedditSays,removed,why cant a pizza place be the home of a pedophile ring
ShitRedditSays,removed,just because they fell for trumps promises doesnt mean theyre less intelligent well if you look at demographics that voted trump youll figure out that they do tend to be less intelligent
ShitRedditSays,removed,i havent looked at the evidence and i can tell you havent either regardless to dismiss something as atrocious as child sex slavery by saying that this isnt a movie and that its impossible for there to be a sex ring in a pizza place is just absurd
ShitRedditSays,removed,¯ツ¯ obvious fix is hit dick with hammer
ShitRedditSays,removed,also another thought breaking the comment twice in one thread taboo having the whole fempire theme is honestly kind of offputting like i get the idea is to poke fun of a need for privilege but it just seems so extra idk maybe someone can encapsulate my thoughts better than i can atm
ShitRedditSays,removed,that gif has been around for many years and is definitely not exclusive to storefront
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah the netherlands has gone to shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,im black and i do this so it evens out i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats actually pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,not all relationships with an age difference are abusive you know you act like year olds cant grasp that being sent to jail on a rape charge you didnt commit isnt nice
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is it obvious that she is vulnerable
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol she destroyed that guy that called her a baby in the thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the fact that socialism scares them and didnt scare the cuban spanish russian and ukrainian etc etc people is that fifty years of cold war propaganda had not tainted the idea of communism for them we have to fight to religitimize socialism and dispel the myth of the american dream before they will reject trickle down economics and capitalism as a whole racism is as much a part of the brainwashing as straight up capitalist propaganda and im confident the majority of trump voters arent racist necessarily so much as ignorant which i can personally confirm is easy to become if you grow up in bumfuck nowhere maybe im just holding onto hope that people can change their minds and see truth after believing lies
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only reason not to go out with someone whos sucked dicks is because they could have up to stds
ShitRedditSays,removed,antisemitism do you know what that word means
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not trying to be a troll im just sharing my thoughts on it i even said the boyfriend is at fault too im not sure why youre attacking me
ShitRedditSays,removed,i really dont understand why you guys find this upsetting
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait are we now justifying the support of fascists because they bought the propaganda
ShitRedditSays,removed,so which are you
ShitRedditSays,removed,what happened to worst of i know its still reddit and awful but since when did uvodkabarf and uzachums start sanctioning the awfulness
ShitRedditSays,removed,the thread was about men caring about partner count it makes sense to get that perspective which obviously a lot of men share or this wouldnt be a thing have fun going through my post history 😱
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wouldnt blame red pillers for this everything about divorce is framed this way in media
ShitRedditSays,removed,got mine for christmas at i think the katana is just a teenage right of passage at some point
ShitRedditSays,removed,because i find it funny when people get butthurt about words on a screen
ShitRedditSays,removed,red pillers did not invent the patriarchy this is a timeless bit of dominant antiwoman discourse
ShitRedditSays,removed,it fucking works
ShitRedditSays,removed,religion openly preaching hate is kind of relevant and islam is everything but compatible with western values
ShitRedditSays,removed,is the original drama so from what i get one of the mods of ahs started dating a neonazi people found out so they both deleted their accounts then made new accounts ucoffeeinawineglass the ex mod and uwineinacoffeecup the nazi to make smug shitposts in rdrama apparently the mod was also a relatively shitty person before they were openly involved with a neo nazi as well
ShitRedditSays,removed,why should there be antiislamic sentiment due to this what happened has nothing to do with religion islam is very tolerant of homosexuality
ShitRedditSays,removed,so censorship will help
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah because every man is obviously a rapist s
ShitRedditSays,removed,like any other ideology islam and islamism can and should be criticised
ShitRedditSays,removed,right but i was on reddit at am last night i saw the very first comments in the threads about the shooter way before anyone even knew how many there were or why they were doing it and so many redditurds were just sure this was done by a big bad muslim
ShitRedditSays,removed,this whole mess sounds like a godsend for the american right wing a muslim terrorist attack against the lgbt community their two most hated demographics pitted against each other if it were to come out that this were masterminded by a mexican illegal immigrant it would catapult drumph into the white house
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow nice hate speech you have there selfawareness much
ShitRedditSays,removed,islamic rats
ShitRedditSays,removed,no the sjws are shoveling this to the side saying wow this doesnt represent all of islam even though this was a religious act even though there is so many hateful things taught in islam
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are all fat redpillers so probably not
ShitRedditSays,removed,its almost like its possible have a nuanced view of the situation rather than have a kneejerk reaction and blame billions of people because of one person gone mad
ShitRedditSays,removed,not denying that we need more background checks but im skeptical to believe that will lead to a significant decrease in violent crimes lets play a game i like to call spot the american
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the onion puts it best when it reprints this after every shooting says posted and gun laws are like seat belt laws the cant save everyone but they can cut down on the total in the aggregate at the moment there is no way to stop a known radical from legally buying guns because being on the terror watch list cant stop you from buying a gun
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand does one have to take a test to know if theyre a legitimate fetishist and if they arent then the rape porn will affect them negatively as opposed to the officially licensed fetishist its like youre tying yourself in knots to be down on people who enjoy rape fantasy porn but not on people who exclusively identify sexually with rape fantasy thats just silly to me and why shouldnt someone feel entitled to look at the porn they want to i think sexything had it right learn about consent reflect on your tastes and attractions respect other people wrinkling your brow in worry over a hypothetical person that is watching rape porn but not exclusively enough to rise to your definition of fetish is silly yeah we sure have to watch out for those people enjoying it too much but not authentically enjoying it enough like cynically enjoying it or something
ShitRedditSays,removed,im taking child porn out of this because you dont have a consenting adult there i wouldnt even count it in the same league as rape fantasy porn i just want to know if youre against bdsm relationships and consenting rape fantasy i feel like this issue has somewhat shown a contingent of srs to be pretty sex negative but people keep skirting around it
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre willfully misreading this come on two actors having consensual sex as part of rape fantasy isnt the same thing as rape and saying its politically correct to censor rape fantasy porn isnt saying its politically correct to not actually rape someone
ShitRedditSays,removed,if people here didnt treat muslims like fucking werewolves waiting for the full moon there wouldnt be an environment to make some guy from new york decided to shoot people up i apologize but this type of thinking helps no one yes antimuslim bigotry is a problem that should be tackled but at the same time youre blaming the actions of this terrorist on conditions that may or may not have affected him i doubt that anyone would suddenly decide to shoot innocent people at a gay nightclub because they faced bigotry islam does view homosexual behaviour as a sin and while it doesnt condone massacre of innocents the shooter today either had some sort of mental issues or was radicalized into thinking that he should take matters into his own hands and do what he thought was gods work
ShitRedditSays,removed,unjerk you know what i dont understand a lot of people on srs arent afraid to rip violent and reactionary parts of the bible or christianity in general i dont understand why we cant also criticize the quran and by extension islam the same way it doesnt mean that were bigots we can be antimuslim bigotry while still criticizing some undeniably violent aspects of the quran
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats odd last year the german minister of family had to admit that over of the refugees arent qualified for even the most simple jobs and that was after telling us that were about to get a massive wave of syrian doctors engineers and skilled workers
ShitRedditSays,removed,they get food accomodation and are safe from war and persecution and thats all theyre entitled to if that isnt enough for their liking tough luck the only reason they want to get to germany sweden or england is because the social benefits are high and the legal barriers are low fun fact i work in an emergeny shelter for particulary vulnerable refugees in berlin these traumatized women and children arent just ungrateful and lack any sort of respect they actively destroy the shelter because they wanna move into apartments provided they dont go clubbing all night
ShitRedditSays,removed,because economic migrants that pretend to be refugees bleed the social system dry clog up administrations and courts with their unwarranted requests and block capacities that are badly needed for actual refugees and that only because they want free apartments free health care free food and an allowance that beat everything they had in their homeland without having to do anything in return provided they can request asylum in germany sweden or england the problem is that these fake asylum seekers no matter how obvious their lies are cant be deported until their request has been processed and then they can appeal the decision and stay another nine months and more and when their home countries refuse to take them back youre stuck with them for good its kinda like seeing middle class people force their ways into food lines for needy people grab what they can and toss the stuff they dont like straight into the dumpster who wouldnt hate people like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,hold the fuck up are you trying to say that it was americas dissent towards lgbt and not islams that influenced his actions america had mad major progression in the past few years towards gay rights while religions have not radical ideas and mental instability create mass murders not a country that has been pushing for change ignoring his faith and pretending it did not have any influence on who he is or what he grew up to believe is extremely ignorant
ShitRedditSays,removed,the reddit reaction to the orlando pulse shooting is causing near all subs to be too toxic and low hanging fruit right now
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty well the whole of reddit at the moment looks like im hanging out in rdarksouls until people shut the fuck up about their bigoted opinions
ShitRedditSays,removed,is a margin of error i think one margin of error still represents a large group of people
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs arrogantly mocking anyone that doesnt agree with their leftist narrative and doing anything to ignore the root of the problem for no other reason than their own arrogance in oh wait weve been there for ever
ShitRedditSays,removed,am i supposed to assume the bearded man in the cartoon is muslim
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyll find a way oh im sure a white christian male forced him to yell allahu akbar and shoot up the club its impossible for a minority to do anything wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,he literally said allahu akbar and pledged his allegiance to isis before shooting up the club
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean sexual repression fuels rape what a novel concept
ShitRedditSays,removed,ramadan mubarak
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes of course he swore allegiance to isis not because of islam but because of fox news and the republican party how could i be so blind thank you for your insight ramadan mubarak
ShitRedditSays,removed,rape play is a supprisingly common part of bdsm bondage discipline sadism masochism creepy yes but its all roleplaying rape play sounds wierd but somehow weve accepted tying someone up and flogging them wearing leather as somewhat mainstream people who actually do this in real life know its just a fantasy and have things like safe words to protect themselves the only people who dont get that sexual fantasies start and end in the bedroom of two people whove previously discussed them are the trp types and well srs is another sub full of people almost as bad as people they mock
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is getting ridicolous
ShitRedditSays,removed,the word everyone is searching for is xenophobic and yes you can criticize a religion and its followers without being racist just like we need to have a discussion about gun control we probably should discuss that islam is not very lgbt friendly and this shooting while it may be an isolated event might represent attitudes that could be common among muslims from more conservative countries saying you find the idea of islamaphobia disgusting doesnt make a problem go away but as a diverse country like america we need to protect our minorities and criticize evil even if that means singling out the practices of other minority groups you can do so in a way thats constructive and brings greater awareness to the issue thats much better than being an elitist hipster rolling your eyes and running to a safe space on the internet where you can feel more superior than bigoted trump supporters
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty big claim to make without any source or data to back it up bigot
ShitRedditSays,removed,cuckcuckcuckcuckcuckvuvjcjfjrjrjf
ShitRedditSays,removed,you really think the bible is as fucked up as the quran i mean its equally bullshit but every other page of the quran is something horrible
ShitRedditSays,removed,does srs not realize that the vast majority of muslims are antilgbtq sure i agree this event wasnt the time for a discussion on censorship and trying to use the event as a way to push your own agenda is terrible but that doesnt mean we shouldnt take a critical look at what happened here many muslims want to keep laws about homosexuality being outlawed and the like those views are present in america as well im not denying that but these views still could have easily influenced what happened in orlando and it isnt wrong to talk about them
ShitRedditSays,removed,so fucking sick of redditors crying about how bad rnews censorship is in the wake of dead people removed threads isnt really the issue here
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty good points trust a feminist to whine about nothing
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are dying enjoy
ShitRedditSays,removed,you lot are as bad as the people using this tragedy as an excuse to bash all muslims oh fuck reddit for talking about the fact that the perpetrator was a muslim extremist we should be focusing on the victims and we can do that by complaining about islamophobes who are talking about actual facts related to the massacre oh and also how gun laws are awful and we should tighten laws around guns rather than talk about the religion of the shooter
ShitRedditSays,removed,mad at reddit okay some americans have passed antitrans laws are these the same people on reddit you are talking about because some americans are doing something wrong we cant be critical about a religion that endorses the murder of gay people you cant have a problem with a religion without also having conflict with its followers but that does not mean you hate them dont get me wrong im sure some do but that is not a prerequisite i think most religions are backwards but there are plenty of good religious people islam as a set of ideals and laws is one of those backwards religions imho that is not an attack on muslims its a critique of islam that is open to debate
ShitRedditSays,removed,who is this they who on reddit is treating gay people like shit but now after this tragedy are using the cause to demonize muslims you are over generalizing here
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you think the censorship is fine
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is a true version of the quran the one in arabic this is not some antiislam comment but thats actually the truth as i learned in world religions this year but redditors dont really know much about islam and what its really like nor do they want to
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets just ignore the fact that the worst shooting in us history was just perpetrated by a man who practiced islam which calls for horrible treatment of women and gays not to mention this seemed to be the case a few years ago aswell hmmm ring a bell the reason people are talking about it is obviously a problem that needs to be brought up just like gun control you cant just ignore it forever this already even happened earlier with san bernardino there is a mismatch in western culture islam that needs to be addressed sorry if it hurts your feelings
ShitRedditSays,removed,ughhhhh ughhhhhh ughhhhhh reddit right i hate them so much ughhhhhh
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why i dont care for the jews
ShitRedditSays,removed,im more curious as to how the neofascists will react to this sure a bunch of fags got killed but the offender was a filthy raghead hate deadlock silly me theyll just have a party because they can celebrate the deaths and prosecute the worlds second largest religion at the same time fucking wankers
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was an isis motivated terrorist attack
ShitRedditSays,removed,im gay and i wish the same thing however i also wish that people would stop using this tragedy to further any political agenda i dont like people who say that this is evidence for lax gun laws and i dont like people who say this is evidence for stricter gun laws its a tragedy its a single event stop spinning it to try and confirm your political leanings if you want to convince people of the fact that stricter guncontrol laws decrease firearm deaths then
ShitRedditSays,removed,how about she appreciates the country that shes an illegal citizen in then im not american but if someone came to my country illegally then takes scholarships meant for legal citizens and then doesnt even acknowledge my countrys contribution and disrespects my nations laws culture and government thats not a person who deserves to live here
ShitRedditSays,removed,innocent until proven guilty is meant for the courtroom process not the peoples personal judgement
ShitRedditSays,removed,not really only when theres no proof
ShitRedditSays,removed,but thats his point someones ideology made him kill people he found disgusting
ShitRedditSays,removed,white christian i think youll find theyre usually atheists and indeed mentally ill rarely but not never provoked by their ideologies as this man
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats easy just dont let savage muslims in our countries
ShitRedditSays,removed,and all you care about is protecting a religion that advocates your friends and family members death
ShitRedditSays,removed,rude
ShitRedditSays,removed,i can tell since you dont want to prevent further death that can be avoided
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh great lets compare the medieval crusade to a current fucking terrorist organization that is a menace to the world as a whole sure what if they killed like gay guys decapitate anyone that dare oppose them and treat their women like fucking pack animals of course all the things theyve done in oppose of your fempire is fine and dandy causemuh islam is a religion of peace sentiency is a gift you dont deserve
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are talking about pantsing guys thats what they meant as werent you ever this post is bullshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,islamic culture and gay culture are not compatible
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes white and christian which is why it isnt blanketed across the front page killed and wounded in a hate crime vs killed and maybe no credible threat to kill anyone last i read he was still being interrogated thats why its not on the front page also hes a progressive bernie supporter whose facebook activity including comparing trump to adolf hitler
ShitRedditSays,removed,whished it didnt happen yes but i wouldnt want my perpetrator to get involved with the police a warning is enough
ShitRedditSays,removed,idk how your school worksworked but detention is a pretty big thing it would be much better for both to just talk to his parents and see if they can help but i doubt someone asking that shit on legaladvice understands this also look at how all the other users commented the same way thats not sexual assault its just being a prick at a young age and those users who are saying this arent random redditors they are the top contributors to that subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,hard to tolerate hateful if he finds it hard but still thinks its right to tolerate then thats a good thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,you commies just got btfo how does it feel faggots all your hard work down the pisser and this is coming from a black man die in a fire losers
ShitRedditSays,removed,first they came for the racist and i did not speak out— because i was not racist then they came for the homophobic and i did not speak out— because i was not homophobic then they came for the transphobic and i did not speak out— because i was not a jew then they came for bigots and shitheads in generaland i did not speak out— so yeah basically everyones happy now
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are good reasons why we need to be careful about blood from men who have sex with men msm because close to have hiv and almost dont know it nobody wants to find out weeks after a major surgery or a car accident that they contracted hiv no doctor wants to have to tell them that and no hospital wants that liability the thing is at months after infection we detect of hiv positives the window period is definitely a big issues for the first two months but you could argue based on the evidence that the limitation should be on months instead of and the current recommendations require abstinence in that period a monogamous msm couple that doesnt have other risk factors for hiv iv drug use for example should be eligible to donate as well for a long ass time gays couldnt donate because they were icky and we were afraid of aids were still afraid of aids but now that less people think gay people are icky we can actually have policies based on evidence rather than feelings
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think jews for national socialism is that absurd but yeah gays against islamophobia is just silly no matter how much people here try to white wash it they want you all dead
ShitRedditSays,removed,and why have you posted a thread about my perfectly okay comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wouldnt say all necessarily but the vast majority probably do yeah
ShitRedditSays,removed,the whole rape is about power thing is at best misleading and at worst a myth
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh right then lets take away already implemented customization so we can have people play only as this one character do you play games how could you ever want a game to not have customi characters
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have a friend who contracted hepatitis from a blood transfusion with infected blood we should be doing anything and everything we can to prevent this im sorry if some feelings are hurt but the point is to save lives
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre a disgusting person if you actually think this
ShitRedditSays,removed,probably because those guys havent killed gays in a club on the face of it the two religions preach a similar thing but in the real world only one of them also preaches action in their church
ShitRedditSays,removed,its about being healthy
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not a kiddo i just happen to think your view of this issue is harmful to our public health
ShitRedditSays,removed,what i am against gun control i am european to great looks no one looked at the study i cited
ShitRedditSays,removed,just making the point that using blood for transfusions poses a risk to the receiver and we should do everything we can to eliminate this risk thanks for being hateful
ShitRedditSays,removed,i can say fag because this straight man told me it was okay
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats true for a lot of groups composed of people under
ShitRedditSays,removed,how the fuck is listing statistics bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not at all what i was saying but i wont be changing your opinions
ShitRedditSays,removed,but its not i think there is validity to the argument that someone could still acquire a gun and do this even if guns are legal but the evidence is there in the study i cited that gun crime as a whole goes down when guns are taken out of the picture thats what we should be focusing on
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey dude how does it feel to be actually retarded
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok so its bad to want to be your own race in a game but going to school in blackface as the same character is also bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a flippant use but the people who use their religion to justify slaughtering innocent people are legitimately mentally ill
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyone on this sub needs to just shut the fuck up
ShitRedditSays,removed,i explained it but was downvoted lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do you assume theyre white based on a comment racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do realize that this could literally go meta with your comment linked back to srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,women are more likely than men to watch rape porn
ShitRedditSays,removed,in general yeah but this woman in the video i have to admit she is a grade a bitch
ShitRedditSays,removed,all of you are morons ever heard of consensual nonconsent fetish videos are just that fetishes women have these fantasies as well
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah bro the crewniverse are actually pretty cool and they dont like those trigglypuffs
ShitRedditSays,removed,one of the mods of againsthatesubreddits is dating a mod of reuropean she deletes comments in ahs calling out said european mod when he pops in and claims in rdrama hes not racist this is a dude who talks about gassing liberals and trans people compilation
ShitRedditSays,removed,prolgbt or proislam pick one
ShitRedditSays,removed,err not sure i follow
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was under the impression that this subreddit was satire run by trump supporters
ShitRedditSays,removed,still migrant is a more correct term to use than refugee right migrant can include asylum seekers and refugees as well as economic migrants however it would be incorrect to call an asylum seeker a refugee until the application for asylum has been approved
ShitRedditSays,removed,what youre joking right i dont ever go on that sub i just study law but everyone that doesnt repeat what you said must be racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,at this rate it wont be a phobia anymore
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay sure i was in no way defending him and i repeated that multiple times he absolutely deserves whatever sentence he ends up with i just dont think wishing rape on a criminal is okay either and it should be handled trough jurisprudence people should be trying to appeal and getting involved in the justice system instead of condoning mob justice i have never been on european or the red pill or any other sub of that kind i even participate in the blue pill i can disagree with people disregarding or being unaware of the law without being racist or sexist or whatever else you want to make me out to be
ShitRedditSays,removed,worseits not even hours in and theyve already labeled it terrorism without a single fucking shred of evidence the guy was an american citizen with no priors the fbi hasnt changed one bit since the
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is what your multicultural policies have brought fear of being racist is not conducive to deradicalising these people
ShitRedditSays,removed,again correlation does not mean causation that would be a very hard thing to prove that the reason they are doing better is more diversity i agree that it probably helps but who cares what skin color or gender or whateverthefuck you are all that should matter is your skill level and your qualifications i highly doubt the soccer team is winning more because they are more diverse theyre probably just a better team with better players but you could support the argument of a more diverse board making the company better but not because they are different but because they have more varying skills
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats wrong with social justice in action tumblr in action and mens rights the times i disagree with what is posted there i also point that out case in point me trying to get the roosh v website removed i dont have to agree with you in order not to be sexist or racist i dont have to only hold one view i support mens rights as well as womens rights and i absolutely think that both genders are disadvantaged in different areas i also think a large portion of the social justice movement is damaging for suppressing debate just like you are trying to right now me pointing out the legal definition wasnt wrong and i dont know why you think i am your enemy for doing that
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not sexism it depends on the skill level of the people involved i guarantee most corporations couldnt give a single fuck about who or what the fuck you are just what you can do to benefit the company if you have a better résumé and a better interview than everyone else then you will get hired regardless of whowhat you are now the only reason today that there are more men than women in those type of positions is because typically men go after those positions more frequently than women thats not sexism thats gender allocation for careers
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sexually identify as a transphobic copypasta ever since i was a cis boy i dreamed of soaring over the default subs dropping hot sticky pastas on disgusting trannies people say to me that a person being this much of a bigot is impossible and im fucking retarded but i dont care im beautiful im having razer softwareinstall copy paste macros the donald shortcuts and kia websites on my keyboard from now on i want you guys to call me ciswhitemaelstorm and respect my right to paste from above and hate needlessly if you cant accept me youre a reverse racist and need to check your safe space privilege thank you for being so understanding
ShitRedditSays,removed,how would gun control have prevented this
ShitRedditSays,removed,bernie the rape fantasist is going to be disappointed
ShitRedditSays,removed,hello im new to this sub looking forward to hating people who are not white males with the rest of you
ShitRedditSays,removed,pro islam pro lgbt pick one
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you know how many syrians have a college degree
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wish the radical muslim in my home city last night thought the same thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahaha fat cunt
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats fucked up
ShitRedditSays,removed,where do you draw the line between peaceful homophobia which is a tenet of islam or violent homophobia
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think he was taking about muslims violence against women is especially prevalent in many predominantly muslim countries
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes because here in the west you get stoned to death for getting raped you arent free to wear what you want you are a victim of female genital mutiliation you are not allowed to work or have an opinion you starve because food is incredibly scarceetc seriously do you sometimes hear the shit you guys spew
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is but thats not why theyre calling terrorism theyre calling it terrorism because the shooter was muslimonly reason its just a political term to shift focus away from the problem which is why dylann roof was never called a terrorist yet he went and killed people for the same reasons this shooter did
ShitRedditSays,removed,i havent said that they have it great because there still are some problems nevertheless the focus should actually lay on human rights violations instead on mean internet comments by mean white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,i read that the orlando shooting was done with an automatic weapon from what ive heard the shooter used an which is a semiautomatic rifle unless he modified it to be automatic heck why does anyone outside the military even need a semiautomatic rifle please correct me if im wrong and i dont mean to be condescending but i think you might be confused as to what semiautomatic means a is a semiautomatic rifle and i think its entirely reasonable for someone outside of the military to own one considering it is mostly used for killing small game and target shooting being highly impractical for actually killing someone
ShitRedditSays,removed,so um considering the mod snafu at ahs and the offensively antipalestinian stance of her and the head mod can we remove the thing in the wikilow hanging fruit page directing people there
ShitRedditSays,removed,an automatic weapon yeah you dont use an assault rifle to hunt deer
ShitRedditSays,removed,today isnt the day
ShitRedditSays,removed,a now former mod is dating a nazi shes also rabidly antipalestinian denies that israel has done anything wrong im serious she even says uss liberty was a total accident and that israel isnt even stealing land check her new account coffeeinawineglass and the head mod is doing olympic level mental gymnastics to make it seem like its not that bad he is anti palestinian as well he claims that mods can do whatever outside of the sub including dating nazis
ShitRedditSays,removed,the guy called and said he is with isis how can we ignore that
ShitRedditSays,removed,if the fags would have had guns they would still be alive but without them they were easy targets
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you just repeat yourself in different threads
ShitRedditSays,removed,im black myself i consider a white person wearing dreads cool do whatever you want to do
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh my gosh i thought the same thing but didnt say it does this mean im secretly a bad person noooooooo
ShitRedditSays,removed,imo white people shouldnt wear dreads but okay
ShitRedditSays,removed,once again reddit steps up to insult anyone outside of their narrowly defined range of acceptable nonconformity the line between normies reeee and fucking hipster trash is vanishingly small
ShitRedditSays,removed,most of the cases of domestic abuse ive heard about in my life are by men however in my case as a man i was physically abused by my wife of years i met her when we were very young and she slowly turned physically abusive hitting me in the face when she got upset over things kicking me pushing me down stairs when i would try to leave to let her cool down one night she got very abusive and smashed a plate on the kitchen table and then threw the pieces at me one actually cut up my face very badly and i have a large scar on my face to this day i called the police because i simply had enough i had tried counselling taking her on vacations really trying hard to make her happy but anyways the police were called ive never raised my hand to my wife and i was still bleeding when they showed up i had a puffed up eye already and was just general hurt i was actually the one removed from my home they stated that since i was a male i was deemed automatically the aggressor because if i wanted to i could over power her at any moment which was true because she was small and im not a tiny guy or anything the next day a counsellor contacted her not me to see if she needed any extra help to take care of herself i finally left after so many years because she was hitting me in the face while our two year old son was crying and putting his hands to his ears i couldnt raise my son in that environment anymore i dunno what im getting at here i think im just trying to say that im sure what the statistics are but a woman can definetly physically abuse a man and i can understand how terrible of a position it can be to be in that situation i just dont know why people have to be like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,where is the lie white people with dreads are a mess
ShitRedditSays,removed,not seeing the issue here
ShitRedditSays,removed,op youre an idiot biologically women become sexually attractive around puberty underage isnt some natural law that we follow its a relatively recent societal law up until only a few centuries ago it was perfectly normal for women under to be having children regularly so quit acting like evolution can happen in a few hundred years
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you dont mind me asking what research are you referring to when i was looking up information on neogenders i never really found anything
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you saying that women shouldnt feel empowered by their own sexual prowess i think you need to rework either your words or your perspective men and women are both hyper sexualized best case in point is chrissy hemmy playing the sterotypical dumb but attactive secretary and it seems like everyone who mentions him in this thread is okay with over sexualizing him beware the double edge sword man
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey funny reddit man tumblr quit neogender in anybody who has one now is or trolling
ShitRedditSays,removed,a pedophile is someone whos attracted to prepubescents at this girl is most definitely past puberty also biologically speaking being attracted to someone past puberty is entirely natural acting on it is obviously wrong because of societal laws but that doesnt mean someone is a pedophile for finding someone beyond puberty and under age attractive so pretty much none of what you said is right
ShitRedditSays,removed,go to the authorities to report what crime exactly
ShitRedditSays,removed,ohmahgawd so much projection in that comment i could sell it for at best buy
ShitRedditSays,removed,kill all women
ShitRedditSays,removed,what crime should be reported just curious
ShitRedditSays,removed,stay in your safe space
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet that would solve all our problems
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are the fucking worst and i love it keep it up
ShitRedditSays,removed,im your huckleberry
ShitRedditSays,removed,the movie was garbage and the actors absolutely contributed to it being so they just happen to be females they are snl bred crap actors with a fat lady who gets laughs for being fat and fumbling around its been done before i actually like mccarthy in mike and molly where she plays a real woman just drop the wannabe farley bit because she sucks at it like kevin james does if me saying fat is offensive oh well i am fat myself and have always preferred fat girls doesnt make us not fati digress the movie sucked for many reasons non of which are the stars being female i also think the media is absolutely responsible for all the attention being on them being female thats what every story focussed on prior to release
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean thats why he asked on a question thread asking what someones innapropriate question would be
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand this i can take a joke but only when its a joke s helps when its a very dry humor and i cant read voice inflection im a gamer im white im cis didnt used to be but meh and im gay tons of things are made fun of about my identity but im fine unless it comes to people being racist after seeing something racist racist comments only promote more hate not any good same with sexism
ShitRedditSays,removed,is good in the box office
ShitRedditSays,removed,kind of the point of the thread buddy the op states these are inappropriate stupid questions
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think many people except for the ones that are too edgy actually dislike the movie much thats the movie itself i mean a lot of guys are mad and actually protested by not going because of marketing a lot of what the director was doing was saying men that would dislike it was because misogyny or sexism that women are funnier obviously opinion baaed and that any failure with the movie would be because society not giving the women a chance i personally liked the movie ive never liked on enough to see it twice i hate rewatching movies but it was decent id never seen the originals so idk but chris was hot af so im good
ShitRedditSays,removed,doesnt the community info say ever read a racist comment on reddit pretty sure that falls in there i assume i dont understand the circlejerkqueef subreddit sorry
ShitRedditSays,removed,he never said all sjws are antiscience
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are unfunny hacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont be lazy the clause didnt mean slaves or black people were of a person it was put in the constitution so that slaves states would have fewer electoral college votes and fewer reps in congress it was the first step away from slavery and should be seen as a positive
ShitRedditSays,removed,hitler was an incredibly bad person but thats not what were talking about why dont you guys stick to overreacting to jokes instead of misunderstanding discussions on history
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one has to consent to being masturbated to and i hope it stays that way because i sure as shit cant ask michael fassbender tom hiddleston hugh laurie mads mikkelsen tom hardy co every time
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait im confused are you all actually defending the burkha for what purpose
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats even more hideous are self defense laws that allow property owners to defend that property hideous i say does anyone know if i can rig my change machine to just spit out quarters so all these human rights activists can avoid the inconvenience of having to carry that smart tv out of my store bet itd help them out if they all had carts to put stuff in i mean who goes out looting and pillaging and remembers a quarter for a cart you have to be reasonable here
ShitRedditSays,removed,feminism is extremely important there are women on earth in bad need of basic human rights it bothers me when people say feminism is cancer now theyre entitled to thier opinion and id fight for thier right to say it the issue is people are choosing the tiniest hills to die on like air conditioning is sexist when the average person sees that they think feminism is well cancer as thats ridiculous that takes attention to the whole notion that women in some parts arent allowed to drive let alone work in offices with air conditioning a luxury when women on every part of earth have basic human rights equal to men then we can tackle the small superfluous stuff
ShitRedditSays,removed,rohlympics has gotten really popular as well during the olympics this year and even though they insist to not post underage content users like to do what other users do on the porn subreddits dedicated to women with small frames that make them appear youngthey focus on the athletes that look underage and what do the mods do defend every submission of that nature
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is opposing the legalization of prostitution not a valid feminist position
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry what
ShitRedditSays,removed,on the bright side someone who makes a comment like that is probably some obese incel who couldnt even chase a turtle down without giving up and returning to their playstation
ShitRedditSays,removed,when you say things like most feminists dont agree with x position for good reason and people who believe x have a problem the implication is that you dont believe that x is valid in my experience the opposition of the legalization of prostitution isnt necessarily based in beliefs about sexuality or traditionalism could you elaborate on your position
ShitRedditSays,removed,what
ShitRedditSays,removed,notallmuslims
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh so just good old racism and bigotry got it thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol wtf have you ever been to south africa mate
ShitRedditSays,removed,do white people have a future in south africa
ShitRedditSays,removed,i fail to see the relevance
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was wondering if this would end up here
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair larry wilmore isnt funny he just looks uncomfortable on camera and his delivery is wooden trevor noah on the other hand is fine and seems to fit on tds just fine cant people dislike larry wilmore for reasons other than his skin color
ShitRedditSays,removed,shes right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am glad this offends you
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually this is a pretty decent statement there is no debating the person shot in milwaukee was doing something nobody should be doing so to try and purport this person as some hero or icon is pretty disingenuous to what every race should be going for
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a joke to make people like you angry
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol what
ShitRedditSays,removed,they dont have to spin anything when blm supporters are murdering people and rioting are you seriously going to pretend that white people spin killed the cops in dallas seems like a bit of a stretch
ShitRedditSays,removed,aclu is a bunch of garbage freeze peach defeners i fucking hate people who idolize them and think they can do no wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,the fuck are you on about i dont remember stealing a continent
ShitRedditSays,removed,why comment on social issues when you can just blanket blame a race its not like racism and the mistreatment of native populations is actually a huge issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,what does this have to do with kkk no racist stuff was said
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realize its not a choice for them to wear it right islam dictates that they must wear it its a form of oppression
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you want your race to be represented more move to a couple try where youre the majority the us is majority white therefore so is hollywood deal with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit fuck you lets kill every man child on this god forsaken website
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was a joke the average person that upvoted that comment like myself dont actually think thats what op should have done and anyone who thinks that isnt true is idiotic
ShitRedditSays,removed,god forbid somebody make an offcolor joke on an anonymous text board
ShitRedditSays,removed,waaaah its just a joke waaaahh joke omg stop youre triggering me
ShitRedditSays,removed,i tried to kill myself by jumping off of a bridge but i still think jokes involving suicide are pretty good i know i dont speak for everyone and there are probably many in my shoes that dont find it funny but to sit back and say that everyone should feel a certain way is ignorant
ShitRedditSays,removed,where am i
ShitRedditSays,removed,is it not true that west africans had a slightly different type of muscle fiber or something that gives them more potential on average to be better at sprinting than people who didnt have that type of fiber east africans dont have this but tend to be better at long distance running the same way people in iceland are on average better at lifting really heavy things and dominate in powerlifting i dont think its racist to acknowledge this but i think it becomes problematic when you just say black peopleafricans are good at sport when its actually people from a certain region that produce better athletes at certain sports thats like saying white peopleeuropeans are good at weightlifting when in fact its mainly people from iceland who are sometimes genetically predisposed to be stronger and better at lifting this isnt to discount social reasons why some demographics dominate in some areas but there certainly is a genetic component there
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah i was mainly just talking about sprinting based off an article i read about the olympics tried googling but couldnt find it think it was by the guardian basketball and football probably have mainly social explanations
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt a biotruth or race realism my point is that its not really about race its more that people in some areas of the world have on average genes that predispose them to run faster provided they are able to participate in the sport it becomes racial when people just assume that black people are good at sport and dont acknowledge that africa is a huge continent and very diverse see iceland analogy
ShitRedditSays,removed,economically disenfranchise a whole race for over a hundred years and yeah people good at basketball just might emerge from there making the assumption that black people are predisposed to basketball just like the rest of the comments here which insist that west africans are genetically predisposed to running faster or that whites are predisposed to football this thread is a shitshow
ShitRedditSays,removed,im gay and i dont take offence to this at all its pretty funny why cant anyone here take a joke pls stop taking offence on behalf of everyone kthxbai
ShitRedditSays,removed,the comment linked to does say that people in between genders exist i think this is a misunderstanding over what no gender is referring to and the part quoted in the title is referring to those otherkin that dont exist outside of like high school students
ShitRedditSays,removed,what would be your opinion if you were a pedophile yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,your comment makes no sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh propaganda huh i just think people born with a mental illness should be treated atleast somewhat equally to the gifted not saying raping kids and videotaping is should be legal or that the current child pornography should not be banned i just think that there are some good reasons behind thinking otherwise
ShitRedditSays,removed,and if i dont hate my whiteness im touted as a racist why cant we all just fucking get over ourselves and be good people to each other
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol she did deserve it though dont put things in other peoples faces if you dont want anything in your face if it was a guy everyone would have the same reaction i think the reason why they hate literally anything to do with women is because people like you turn this into an issue regarding women
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyone is misogynist racist white male
ShitRedditSays,removed,medicine is not science nor is it a part of stem
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not how sarcasm works
ShitRedditSays,removed,the noise isnt the indicating factor in the story a human was pestering another the pestered one was like get off me and instant karmaic forces made her look like a goofball spinning around wiping her eyes because she was bothering someone it sounds like you will take literally any excuse to shit on someone for being a dude spray residue wow now we know which side you want to be sympathetic to it hurtssssss like ffffuck guysssss omg i cant even i need an adult
ShitRedditSays,removed,could you provide for me reputable sources that back up a pay gap
ShitRedditSays,removed,implying the civil marches in the are remotely comparable to the chimping out happening now and before you say lol racist theres blacks and then theres niggers blm is headed by niggers
ShitRedditSays,removed,as far as im aware the universally agreed upon thing by people who know what theyre talking about was that it wasnt true to the extent its claimed ie cents to dollar that marked the average earnings of all men to all women without taking into consideration job choices positions within those fields hours worked overtime put in parttimeabsences taken etc and when everything was factored in the difference becomes practically negligible im trying to come into this listen to what you have to say with an open mind it sounds like youve looked into this before and if ive learned anything its to always be open to changing your opinion on a subject so if there is really tons of research im interested in seeing it
ShitRedditSays,removed,biology ≠ medicine
ShitRedditSays,removed,im black and my black family and i both agree that blm is not what mlk would have wanted its not the way we should be approaching the issues violence threatening etc go ahead ban me ban the actual black person lets see whos racist now
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you people take everything way too seriously
ShitRedditSays,removed,think my buddy might be a wee bit mad internalizing all your issues and projecting them on minorities will do that though hahaha
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh you better believe i had people like michael brown and in mind when i made this comment really though its just a jab at the hypocrisy of the media who prop such figures up as racial martyrs when in really every single one of them were active criminals who had committed felonies shortly before their deaths not innocent kids yearning to go to college like their mothers who are in denial testify
ShitRedditSays,removed,so i went to check srs to see if it hated whites as much as people say and heres a thread about launching them all into space i dont know what that is but it isnt equality
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont see how this is about men over glorifying themselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay so people have different ways of getting off the reason the redditor bridged strapons to meat is to create a joke at least thats what im getting
ShitRedditSays,removed,and it was funny gold star
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a year old male college student who doesnt know the first thing about being a parent nor do i have any connection with it and you just made me cry year old male college student checks out
ShitRedditSays,removed,so nobody cares there is actually one reference in the book confirming she is white or the artwork im sure being approved by jk rowling
ShitRedditSays,removed,which part is racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,wwwmingwongcom
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you have people working for you one works hours a week and the other works hours plus overtime a week then which person will you pay more and give a raise to sooner the person who works overtime right well on average married men have more hours from overtime than their single male counterparts also on average married women work fewer hours than their single female counterparts so therefore men on average work more hours than women do
ShitRedditSays,removed,when i hear that word i just picture a huge fat greasy neckbeard sorry i know it isnt fair for women and poc in stem fields its just my first immpression
ShitRedditSays,removed,if anybody is guilty of condensing the wage gap its progressive politicians hilary obama et al will go on all day about how women should be paid the same as men for the same work they dont elaborate and go into the nuance of the problem they over simplify it making it an easy argument to debunk
ShitRedditSays,removed,who is hurt by somebody owning a person who is hurt by somebody owning a picture not choosing a side here just pointing out a clear flaw in your logic
ShitRedditSays,removed,on one hand i dont want to reduce a woman to nothing but her kink on the other hand i cannot deny that as a man i really enjoy reading about female exhibitionism so you do you as much as you want and i mean that in all of the ways
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah fuck men they shouldnt be in society we should kill them all
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe because reddit isnt just one person and that different people can have different views ah nevermind just fuck men and reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sure about that ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
ShitRedditSays,removed,that doesnt really hold up at all in society today though for at least the past years women have been nothing but highly encouraged to take on more technical professions with tons of female based scholarships and plenty of companies in stem fields killing for female employees the main problem is women choosing to go into gender studies and other useless degrees because they think they will be combatting sexism instead of doing the literal combatting by going into the stem fields more university students today are females rather than males so we should expect to see this reflect in the higher educated work place except we dont
ShitRedditSays,removed,did anyone even watch the clip before commenting here she clearly deserved it she was being totally insufferable and annoying to that cop and all he did was wave the balloon out of the way the fact that it got pepper spray into her eyes is just icing on the cake
ShitRedditSays,removed,people in the work force are the ones who are pushing to get more females into it where do you think this type of change comes from please enlighten me on what the major problem is and if you are to tell me that its workplace discrimination then you are the one who needs to do the research its a fact that women work less hours than men and work lower paying jobs on average and of course much of this is due to unfair life responsibilities that are put onto women disproportionately but to say that its due to women being discouraged from certain jobs or that its because theyre seen as bossy is simply untrue httpwwwtopmanagementdegreescomwomendontmakeless
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes it is important that we dictate exactly what people think and how they think it we must avoid having our precious feefees hurt
ShitRedditSays,removed,because niggers poc are always bitching about how they deserve equal right more rights than the white man they already got freed from slavery after the civil war so they should have stopped right their because racisim was over at that moment people want to cry and complain that racisim exists today when its just cops killing niggers poc who commit crimes s
ShitRedditSays,removed,a lot of you are too
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes right
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt the only reason however i do believe there is a strain of trumpsupport treating his campaign like a free speech protest the protestors make the left look bad plain and simple they dont just say they disagree with you they tell you youre the scum of the earth and trump has no right to say what he does im no supporter but i did attend a trump rally partially for the social experiment aspect lets just say i felt the hate and saw swastikas outside the event but none at all inside the protesters validate the feelings inside the rally and almost make trump seem rational
ShitRedditSays,removed,like a violent person especially a criminal noun
ShitRedditSays,removed,sarcasm isnt for everyone i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,ming wong i would have agred but then did a simple whitepages search httpwwwwhitepagescomnamemingwong turns out it is a real and common name stop being an offense junky offense taken to junkies
ShitRedditSays,removed,and they bitch about having a black history month idiots dont know shit about black history
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is on srssucks now im a legend mom get the camera
ShitRedditSays,removed,appropriate black culture shaun king rachel dolezal american heroes
ShitRedditSays,removed,unqueef i have an infant daughter first kid so still new to a lot of things and im into photography as a hobby so i have a big fancy dslr with some pretty big telephoto lenses at some point when shes older i expect ill be taking my daughter to the park to play and ill want to get some pictures i do have kind of a small fear that getting out this big camera with a telephoto to take pictures of her on the playsets and such might get me flagged as a creeper to other people ive been approached before just taking pictures of my friends and family at public gatherings so im especially worried about the scenario where the subjects are young children whats your take in your experience is this no big deal and my fear is irrational or am i likely to be fending off a lot of concerned citizens requeef
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is he telling his coworkers to be indiscriminate sluts this guy has a weird job
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be honest the extreme leftism on this subreddit deserves its own srs posts go ahead downvote me but there is certain truth in that comment chain and this community seems to have a blind bias against anything that is even slightly conspiratorywhile this obviously is not open your minds dont take to extremes find the golden mean and be happy we all enjoy hopping on bandwagons until you look at others and realize that you all have turned into animals
ShitRedditSays,removed,one person guy said something dumb somewhere and she he suddenly became the spokesperson for all of feminism men
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you mean that worldstar as a concept is unethical or that white people watching it is unethical
ShitRedditSays,removed,mate bottle that shit up
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats like us right
ShitRedditSays,removed,neither do you fascist
ShitRedditSays,removed,pepper spraying children because their mother supports trump isnt a good idea
ShitRedditSays,removed,the person is obviously referring to places like saudi arabia where women arent allowed to drive or leave the house uncovered what was she wearing did he think she was coming on to him are literal legal defenses not just things assholes say in youtube comment sections if you really think that womens issues in the us or uk are of equal gravity or that you can in any way relate to a woman being murdered because she was discovered to not be a virgin then you are as equally blind to your own privilege as you claim white men are
ShitRedditSays,removed,im transgender if someone found out in all but one state it would be legal to kill me under the defense of transpanic where a man is so totally shocked by my existing near him that he killed me by accident surely surely there has to be more context to this please tell me that in the united states this is not a legally acceptable defense to a homicide thats justwow this statement is absolutely ridiculous this defence is only used if there are unwanted homo transsexual advances and it doesnt make the crime magically dissapear you would simply dont get as hard a punishment also the usa isnt the only state where there are these laws
ShitRedditSays,removed,triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,this person did this to get reactions not because they mean it trolls thrive off attention and people being offended lets not give it to them please
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont the problem its good advice given the context of the post there are crazy people out there
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly the child support doesnt go to the child that often it really should have to be spent on the kid
ShitRedditSays,removed,its just a joke though
ShitRedditSays,removed,this actually is a good one i laughed at both ops joke and yours because offensive comedy is funny for some people shocking i know
ShitRedditSays,removed,yep blocking highways destroying towns and pulling people out of their vehicles definitely helps bring awareness to police brutality
ShitRedditSays,removed,trick question he goes on to employ the black person who shoots people and rapes women
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one is forcing you to be here get the fuck out already
ShitRedditSays,removed,it should still be paid mind it should just be earmarked for the kid
ShitRedditSays,removed,ahh i see youre the type that is afraid of the truth and you are telling me to grow up perhaps you should turn that highpowered perception upon yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha its not your sub fucktard its reddits sub and you pieces of shit keep talking about how much you hate it yet youre all still heretruth is you fucking love it and you just love to be horrible people at the same time youre all disgusting hypocrites
ShitRedditSays,removed,consider this this little sub here is filled the most vile corrupt vitriolic hypocritical people on reddit you all constantly give fauxadvice to people like me that call it like it is and bring you truth but you all fail to see how much hate lives in all your hearts you pretend that you are good people but the hate that comes you all is the most disgusting part of reddit you are not good people youre hateful vindictive and quite hilarious to watch i always admit when i am wrong btw ill let you know when it happens
ShitRedditSays,removed,no im more of a victim than you if you disagree with me then i will doxx you and internet vigilante your ass because victimhood means having power over other peoples livelihoods
ShitRedditSays,removed,first all the people you listed do experience oppression but not because of their skin color and definitely not on the systemic level that black people experienced oppression second the left is just fine without you its evolved and progressed and you sitting around feeling nostalgia for days of the past is useless third get the fuck out
ShitRedditSays,removed,what have blm done thats so terrible
ShitRedditSays,removed,starting riots burning gas stations and beating up white people for being white is not an excuse to act like this the amount of violence blm is doing isnt solving anything but making the black community they represent look even more like second class citizens
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree but the whole miluwakee thing is kind of messed up because apparently the kid pointed a gun at the officer its just a hard pill to swallow in general beating up people etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe im missing something whats wrong with this statement
ShitRedditSays,removed,israel is an angel hell i see this among nominally left of center persons too i too got a wake up call when i saw someone say well were not gonna have open borders until we totally get rid of welfare and got upvoted for it
ShitRedditSays,removed,he isnt saying he is the final source on the subject he is saying the opposite he is saying that others shouldnt say that someones life has been ruined by rape since they are not that person he is saying that we shouldnt think that of a rape victim because we should be focused on helping them make a recovery instead
ShitRedditSays,removed,go on tumblr if you miss liberal propaganda
ShitRedditSays,removed,well
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this whole reddit ironic or do you people actually think posting subjective but partially fact based statement in a circlejerkorium is an argument against them
ShitRedditSays,removed,what when does he say anything about it being okay all he is saying is that it isnt our job to say whether or not their lives are ruined
ShitRedditSays,removed,hitler was actually a far left socialist
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres no reason it shouldnt i just happen to disagree with some interpretations of his comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,so what are you opinions on the burkini ban france just imposed im neutral atm about the subject
ShitRedditSays,removed,i guess trump is having an effect on everyone not just the us
ShitRedditSays,removed,geez i hope this is being sarcastic
ShitRedditSays,removed,but you dont talk about the mobs of hundreds of black people in milwaukee chanting beat all white people and pulling white people from cars and beating them unconscious and burning their vehicles hmmm
ShitRedditSays,removed,so the mother wants her daughter to be trans weird
ShitRedditSays,removed,but that means everything is racist 😔
ShitRedditSays,removed,asa womz is really reaching here
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not ingrained it was learned through life experiences the black students in my high school didnt give a fuck i did give a fuck same school same teachers same environment i am not a special snowflake i just didnt mess around and then expect that whitey is all at fault
ShitRedditSays,removed,but dont women but
ShitRedditSays,removed,talk about low hanging fruit ive been playing mmos for a long time and i just recently got hooked onto ffxiv one of the friendliest most explicitly lgbtfriendly communities ive ever seen and at the same time there are a lot who devote a ridiculous amount of time to the game stop trying to pretend that hardcore gamers are all mouthbreathing wwannabe nazis
ShitRedditSays,removed,yup knew all of them four years senior class of around you get to know them yes all of them did not give a single fuck like i said i am not special i just payed attention if you think high school is difficult it is not it is easy mode compared to real life the black kids were always messing around interrupting class acting the fools then they blame other people for their failings no am not white i am hispanic come a culture that school is not the emphasis go to work get money to bring home i am some friends said fuck that i am getting a degree so i can get a higher paying job and not work like a peasant i have met other black people in my life that do actually give a fuck and they succeed and nothing pisses them off more than the other black people that throw their future away they want to scream at them slap them upside the head and tell them to stop fucking around as a black man you should try and set and example to them and stop blaming other people
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair if you are intent on breaking into my home and endangering the lives of my wife and kid im going to light your ass up
ShitRedditSays,removed,he was carrying a stolen glock and refused to drop the weapon
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean were on srs the whole point of our subreddit is the exact opposite of that premise
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiraceandintelligence
ShitRedditSays,removed,asa blackman back at it again
ShitRedditSays,removed,the issue is that paedophilia isnt an addiction you cant actually cure it without forced sterilization i dont see people who buy sex dolls going out and raping everyone i really do think that a proper study on this has to be done
ShitRedditSays,removed,an active terrorist organisation setting car bombs and killing dozens
ShitRedditSays,removed,calls white people sensitive posts on srs lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre calling other people whiners whilst posting on srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,transphobic isnt a thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,manbabies is a sexist term dont use it again
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah my sisters bf is black and he says blm is just an excuse to loot stores and assault people
ShitRedditSays,removed,muslim isnt a race
ShitRedditSays,removed,the mens rights tards went from to women have no responsibility for their actions in society in seconds
ShitRedditSays,removed,white men have such tiny penis so small
ShitRedditSays,removed,of course redditors have sympathy for rapists its just professional courtesy after all
ShitRedditSays,removed,to people playing this game the acronym blm has stood for black mage for years longer than the blm movement has been around i dont really see why this is even here
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is this one posted that thread is full of awful overreaching comments about the dangers of false rape accusations while ignoring the prevalence of rape being ignored in court but this specific comment seems to be reasonable enough without making incorrect claims about women the court system etc we do agree that in this specific case the daughter was in the wrong right and honestly all its calling for is for him to cut her off once shes a legal adult which is barely a punishment hell if youre not wealthy its pretty standard for that to happen to you anyways
ShitRedditSays,removed,well there is a connection i mean both groups tend to get angry really easily have a penchant for fire and the most devastating thing they can do is make things explode
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is actually kinda funny though
ShitRedditSays,removed,format that properly please no score no actual verbatim comment and whale is a very heavy meat its best cooked very slow like polar bear
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you got the numbers out of the percentages and interpreted them in a meaningless way thank you
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah thats not even the same thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,you dont get to get out of your car at a traffic stop and run away if you do the police are obligated to chase you if you refuse to comply with the polices demands that you drop your weapon you tend to get shot thats how the real world works
ShitRedditSays,removed,at the end of the day who gives a shit why he was pulled over for what it is worth they said he was driving suspiciously which could mean he was swerving etc i dont know at the end of the day its irrelevant as this guy was obviously a criminal from the time he was pulled over to the time he got shot took approximately seconds he ran about a dozen feet and then turned around with his firearm drawn you dont get to pull a gun on a cop just because he had the audacity to pull you over no the real world promisesguarantees you a trial before your peers not an early grave so what the cop should have just stood there and let himself get shot cmon man
ShitRedditSays,removed,the guy ran feet along the side of the road and then turned around with the intent to shoot the cop you dont get to shoot a police officer because you get pulled over this guy deserved to get shot
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean they arent being hanged in the name of islam or by the order of some cleric its the iraqi president who is ordering the iraqi state to do it
ShitRedditSays,removed,and what you do is get upset by jokesur so enlightened
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand you guysyou dont even think that false rape accusations are bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is that wrongis islam a nice religion
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is it racialised
ShitRedditSays,removed,how would you feel if the group with the most political power ignores all your concerns as unimportant oh wait you wont know how it feels because it never happen to you before fuck gay white people and women i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,i heard you liked being pinged
ShitRedditSays,removed,queef that post is pretty unhinged this argument for a death penalty for thatcher based on almost no evidence and only the most flawed analysis is expecially mad httpwebinternlnetuserspaultreanorthatcherhtml
ShitRedditSays,removed,woah
ShitRedditSays,removed,opinions
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks cummybot
ShitRedditSays,removed,mein kampf its breddy gud
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre being pretty condescending for someone who doesnt know what a direct message is lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,that was a good comment why does this subreddit fucking suck so hard
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre just being redundant leftists and minorities are mentally ill in nature
ShitRedditSays,removed,a bunch of nerds playing dress up and carrying long guns in s major city is awesome
ShitRedditSays,removed,good luck with whatever alternate reality youre living in
ShitRedditSays,removed,wanting to commit suicide is not necessarily a result of a mental disease human beings have every right to chose not to exist dismissing all who make the choice as mentally ill is not so different from dismissing people who have different political opinions as mentally ill
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey thats me
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair black and white are antonyms and murder isnt exactly the opposite of spaghetti lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,communists can fuck right off if you dont like america quit trying to undermine our government and go live somewhere more communist friendly
ShitRedditSays,removed,while its transexclusionary i see no reason to assume that this wasnt made in good faith as a misguided criticism about gender roles
ShitRedditSays,removed,it very much is korea and japan have very bad reputations with outside racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,are high school seniors who date freshmen pedophiles
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a valid point
ShitRedditSays,removed,so should it be made a crime to fantasize about having sex with children or what is the objection to the argument that as long as theyre not actually rape a kid pedophiles rather need help than condemnation
ShitRedditSays,removed,a bit of a misleading title the linked comment is in reply to a comment asking should hs seniors date freshmen in context linked title asks a good question
ShitRedditSays,removed,eat shit and die
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay lets talk about those things but my question was if a certain thought should be a crime
ShitRedditSays,removed,the comment i replied to was many people here seem to think its ok to fantasize having sex with children as long as they dont act on them what about drawn imagery or child like sex dolls should they be forbidden should the posession be punished how does the use of these things affect pedophiles in my opinion not everything is that crystal clear and it should be allowed or even encouraged to discuss and research this questions
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you have a reference or just your common sense maybe allow people to own such material if they are under supervision by a psychologist could be better than leaving them alone and telling them to just cope with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont sex offender registries list the crime if not they seem counterproductive
ShitRedditSays,removed,my cock is cringing so hard im in danger of spontaneous circumcision
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree but the title is misleading the comments were about year olds dating year olds
ShitRedditSays,removed,since when do you guys make jokes
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think has anything to do with gender once you get to a certain level of fame some people think death wishes are morally fine
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao i actually laughed at this one
ShitRedditSays,removed,people on reddit generally dont call trans people it
ShitRedditSays,removed,¯ツ¯ yall are crazy
ShitRedditSays,removed,hmmm
ShitRedditSays,removed,ya think so
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,a high school student comes on here to ask a sincere question and is downvoted for it welcome to the sjw community
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes just saying if youre a modern feminist youre most likely ugly he didnt say anything about her looks are the only thing she can contribute to society do you see how its not the same if someone is a trump supporter and you say its because hes an idiot it would be silly for me to assume that youre saying all he has to offer society is his intelligence makes no sense
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait so this post is bad because hes mocking the sjws that use the word cis while your tag is dicks or gtfo which is also mocking people how is that not hypocrisy
ShitRedditSays,removed,implying nobody that has a chance can use reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,taking a bad joke a little to seriously perhaps
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean all the bullying and stereotyping in news and nedia from a young age
ShitRedditSays,removed,fyi butte is pronounced like the beaut in beautiful so the joke doesnt make as much sense as you think
ShitRedditSays,removed,cs lewis enjoys the company of other men
ShitRedditSays,removed,uhhhh i play a lot of rocket league and im a well adjusted person please dont lump us together also all my friends are chill too so yeah
ShitRedditSays,removed,o rly
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao so basically you just want people to do it where you want it i know people who legitimately go to clubs just to dance not to get hit on your preferences dont dictate the rules of society i get what your saying and i agree that it sucks that women have to feel the kind of way an experience like the one mentioned would produce however while you may feel that way not everyone does i know a couple that met at work and have been in a relationship for over years i once asked someone out in a grocery and we date for nearly wishing people would have enough common sense to know when and how to approach a woman is one thing thinking that your preferences represent a universal preference and entirely different story
ShitRedditSays,removed,why
ShitRedditSays,removed,cancer isnt fun and thats what this hellhole of a sub is you should try rimgoingtohellforthis or rthedonald
ShitRedditSays,removed,mmm so no woman has ever murdered or raped
ShitRedditSays,removed,i r o n y
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre damn wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,so what youre trying to say is that women dont murder and if they do it was really a man
ShitRedditSays,removed,shes though lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck no
ShitRedditSays,removed,trump crooked hillary for prison
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mate whales
ShitRedditSays,removed,they must be afraid that theyll turn into black gay trans women if they read the sidebar
ShitRedditSays,removed,shes not a teenager though shes a married woman how is anyone attracted to her an ephebeophile
ShitRedditSays,removed,her namy is tabby ridiman shes a semiknown youtuber shes a married adult woman no reason for anyone to be shamed for being attracted to her
ShitRedditSays,removed,what most of them are complaining about are people who say you cant do or say this this or that because it offends me that to me is censorship you disagree with them and tell them they cannot do it is that not an attempt at censorship
ShitRedditSays,removed,rjustlegbeardthings
ShitRedditSays,removed,just jokes though white men cant season reeeeeeee reverse racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh get bent
ShitRedditSays,removed,you realize the teen in question is right
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah manyoure so right the creators of south park are racist fuck them
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand people are generally held accountable for decisions they make while drunk even if they regret them when they sober up why should it be different with sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,and every time they complain about being in a labor camp in siberia tell them its just an elaborate joke and that they dont understand humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,patriarchy and toxic femininity do exist you know
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok i see but where in your comment lies the misogyny we expect on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hate islam but there is a difference between hating a religion and hating le spoopy brown people with beards i dont hate muslims they have a right to believe what they want no matter how inane i find the concept of religion and hating muslims as people for being muslims only leads to racism and pain
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpsyoutubewjwbxbgvyqu
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont want to break rule but i dont think hes defending pedos i think hes just saying being banned from using the internet would be the worst punishment
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre actually just quoting this video
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is why females do not belong in any work place that deals with any controversial topics they just cant handle it
ShitRedditSays,removed,havent young women started to earn more than men recently also id imagine that some of that gap is due to maternity leave
ShitRedditSays,removed,im pretty sure he was referring to the idea of hating islam rather than muslims but i may be wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,does that make it ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,castrate all men castrate all white men at utc trueeaglelibrarian replied to castrate all men edit not joking httpiimgurcomyofjxynpng

ShitRedditSays,removed,this shit is way too meta for me
ShitRedditSays,removed,the fappening was terrible and it actually rocked me to my core if these are celebrities who are worth millions of dollars and basically have top notch everything how could i be secure i actually got scared for my nudes because i was harrassed for them quite a few times and got worried because i also use an iphone like jlaw and to distract them i sent all the pictures of the victims i could i know it was bad but i was really scared i hope this doesnt make a bad person
ShitRedditSays,removed,a study of million employees released in march calculated the gender pay gap as follows australia uk france the netherlands sweden no data for the us or canada in this study but its reasonable to assume its in the same ballpark as the figures above these are applestoapples comparison figures so they control for personal choices such as career selection hours worked longevity with employer etc the percentages above are whats left in terms of unexplained factors if women really are less strong at negotiating then the results of that are included in the percentages above if sex discrimination is a factor then its included in those percentages too httpwwwhaygroupcomenourlibrarywhitepapersgenderpaygap
ShitRedditSays,removed,nice counter argument dick
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh chubby girls are hella cute peeps dont know what theyre missin
ShitRedditSays,removed,somehow i think i could see a bit of appeal in that im not sure why but i think i can maybe im lacking in empathy it sounds kinda hot for some reason even though i know the people whose nudes were leaked mustve been horrified
ShitRedditSays,removed,you still looked at them tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,he has german and iranian nationality we dont know yet if he is muslim information comes out of europe slowly remember for months they covered up the torture that occurred during the bataclan killings
ShitRedditSays,removed,there has been plenty of thorough rigorous analysis showing that that the gender pay gap is about a percent or two in western countries for example the study i linked to below among others if you want to dispute that youre going to need something equally thorough and rigorous a couple of comment posts on a newspaper website and a post on a feminist blog arent going to do it the blog post spells out one key reason with this quote gender differences in fulltime employment can be attributed to a number of factors including variations in family circumstances and labour market histories fulltime male workers appear to have more stable labour market histories than fulltime female workers having spent longer periods with their current employer and in their current occupation than women working fulltime in other words on average men have more years of experience in their profession one of the smh comment posts also notes first men tend to work longer hours the average weekly total hours paid for fulltime nonmanagerial employees is hours for men and for women that alone accounts for a difference in earnings next we see secondly the national pay gap figure also lumps together secretaries with chief executives making no account of the higher skills and risks incurred by the later group which rightly entitle them to a higher pay packet ah such rare honesty how refreshing and finally finally the often quoted gender pay gap figure does not take into account that women and men tend to work in different industries and that those femaleheavy industries like retail hospitality and elder care tend to be lower paid controlling for the level of experience hours worked per week and specific job role is what shows the gender pay gap to be all but a myth in the later article the same author quotes data which controls for hours worked but not years of experience failing to note that fields like law have seen a rapid increase in the percentage of female workers over the last decade or two a consequence of that is that the larger number of women in those industries are more recent entrants and there are fewer very senior women with decades of experience for men the ratios are reversed they make up nearly all of the most senior workers and a smaller percentage of new entrants the average man in those professions has a couple of decades more experience than the average woman so naturally the average male earnings will be higher thats an imbalance that will correct itself over time as older workers retire to be replaced by newer cohorts containing a larger percentage of women its not a sexismbased difference at all which is why better quality studies control for years of experience to eliminate that skew then we get a couple of very illuminating examples you can take a male stockbrokers annual taxable income of and halve it to get the average females a stockbrokers remuneration is generally made up of a small base salary plus commission they are paid by the volume of trades they generate which depends on the number and size of clients they bring into their firm its basically a sales job and the nice thing about commissionbased sales is that youre paid what youre worth by definition if you can close the same volume of sales youll always get paid the same surgeons have the fourth biggest pay gap with an average taxable income of for men and for women surgeons are essentially contractors who are paid by the operation with the rate varying based on the type of operation especially perceived difficulty and their level of skills experience as reflected in their reputation as a surgeon a high profile renowned brain surgeon like charlie teo can command higher rates per operation than joe average who spends his weeks removing appendixes in a regional town for reasons that i hope are obvious any female surgeon could become the next charlie teo theres no employer deciding that shell earn less because she has a vagina her career is entirely in her own hands so this is all quite unconvincing so far but buried in the last table are some interesting things that the author doesnt want to talk about lets take a look female telemarketers make more than male telemarketers on average how interesting that doesnt surprise me because women do have better verbal skills than men on average a fact which is very relevant to their earnings in that role female visual merchandisers make more than men i dont have the data for this but id be surprised if it didnt show that women and gay men on average have a better eye for design than straight men female truck drivers earn more than men i know that the mines often prefer female drivers for their giant trucks because their safety records are better on average i wouldnt be surprised if that was at least one of the factors behind their higher earnings in this industry female fitness instructors make more i suspect that most female clients and at least some male clients would prefer to have a female instructor there may also be more female clients than male clients that would lift the billings of female instructors and explain their higher average income female bookkeepers make more than men bottom line gee it almost looks like men and women may have different strengths that in some industries let them thrive to a greater extent i realise thats feminist blasphemy but there have been studies which show genderbased differences in preferences even in day old babies so perhaps its just unhelpful to want to force exactly genderbalanced outcomes in every single single job category just sayin
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh as someone from a muslim country thats fairly true
ShitRedditSays,removed,islamismislam hes right religious conservatism sucks dont tell a muslim hes an islamist op
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean islamism does mean islam in politics kind of like fundamentalism in the us
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one said that now you are generalizing thought you folks were supposed to be progressive but it seems that everyone on this subreddit is a bundle of faggots
ShitRedditSays,removed,that dress literally makes her cleavage the highlighttacky af
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do realize they are sarcastic right
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow this really triggered them
ShitRedditSays,removed,per a source elliott broke off the relationship and alleged victim said she would ruin him if he did thus the accusations highranking cowboys source says that ezekiel elliott has messages saved on his phone proving his exgirlfriend is trying to set him up so fucking gross i cant believe these men not blindly believing a woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,so are you
ShitRedditSays,removed,educational
ShitRedditSays,removed,my sarcasm detector detector detects that your sarcasm detectors are broken as fuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs isnt the brigade anymore because the subreddit is dead since the goldfish attention span of its users wore off
ShitRedditSays,removed,god i take an african history class taught by a wonderful man who is actually from africa and the students hijack his disucssion on dictators and how lucky americans are to not live under any because the students try to assert that under trump america will be worse than any african nation fuck my generation and the far left views popular with it thats why we cant have nice things the display of relative privation is real im going to be honest one of my single biggest gripes with feminism is how it affects women feminist doctrine dictates that confident men with predictable motives are toxic and more androgynous complicated beta males are the men who know how to treat them right however as i have seen with my sister my aunt my best friend and my ex this is never ever the case this sets up women for abusive relationships and even as victims of rape beta males dont stand up for themselves therefore they take out their frustrations on their wives and children instead because they are the only people they feel confident around alpha males dont do this because they stand up for themselves legitimately believing in the alphawolf biotroof the altright autistic guy i listen to that spout bullshit sometimes is laughable
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you found your way here and somehow missed all of the posts highlighting reddits shittiness nice
ShitRedditSays,removed,burn a flag in front of me ill show you a stormtrooper
ShitRedditSays,removed,comment quota reached thank you i am a bot let me know if i am working correctly
ShitRedditSays,removed,exactly there is nothing wrong with thedonald since it does not pretend to be something it is not worldnews and politics both pretend to be unbiased when in reality they are the epitome of censorship at least be honest and paste the entire quote
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true though
ShitRedditSays,removed,that sounds like a fine idea girls shouldnt even need to dress up to be scouts why not just let them go camping
ShitRedditSays,removed,leddit something something fertility
ShitRedditSays,removed,what srs wants isnt right
ShitRedditSays,removed,is extreme lack of empathy a disability
ShitRedditSays,removed,just a reminder that rex tillerson trumps energy secretary pushed not trying to defend trump or any of his corrupt cabinet picks just pointing out that socially liberal reddit is somehow behind an actual member of the trump administration on the subject of trans rights
ShitRedditSays,removed,no matter how gay you are youre still laughing at a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow i thought this subreddit was about fighting gross generalizations i can see penises and humor are not welcome here moving along then
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this subreddit supposed to convince others that vile opinions are vile or to perpetuate a negative stereotype of an angry feminist serious question
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive since discovered the echo chamber nature of this corner of the internet i guess the solution is to unsub and tell the world tales of feminism being dead that it looks like a modern counterpart to faux news but rather than evangelical craziness theyre psycho about perceived inequality oh and the only men that are welcome have to label themselves as warlocks my lesbian sister will get a kick out of you girls enjoy reinforcing your own opinions and narrowing your world view 👍🏿
ShitRedditSays,removed,is that chapin lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol men are now raped at a higher rate than women what alternative universe is this person living in eh the statistics ive seen that theyre physically assaulted more than women so theyre less safe on the streets in general but rape in particular theyre less at risk
ShitRedditSays,removed,and the people who support rape culture can only say well no lets talk about how men are the victims wait where did you get the bold part
ShitRedditSays,removed,women want to be raped less so now men are going to claim theyre raped more some feminists exaggerate numbers as well their rationalemotive for that is identical to their counterpart
ShitRedditSays,removed,hah why because i posted a joke comment there one time im not a trump supporter and even if i was what difference does that make look no hard feelings but i dont think you really understand subreddit simulator nobody there is laughing because hurr durr look its about rape theyre laughing because a bot made the post and humans are reacting to that in the meta sub if you still dont get it i dont know what to tell you
ShitRedditSays,removed,willing to get banned if need be i realize this is against the rules but i dont really think this merits a post here granted im new to this sub but i definitely enjoyed the part of the community that is genuinely calling out people for being shitty too often ive had to deal with bigoted people on here and this seems like a nice outlet that being said the thing that made the post was literally a bot that constructs sentences based off of markov chains the people saying they were upvoting it were laughing because of how horrible it presumably was ie dark humor a la liberal comedians such as louis ck i wasnt under the impression that this was a censorship sub or one that chastises people for finding harmless things funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,usnisschup sums it up pretty well well below sorry for calling you an idiot before but its clearly a joke about a bot making a dark post
ShitRedditSays,removed,but the people making rape jokes or racist jokes arent being serious in fact theyre generally poking fun at how ridiculous racism and sexism really is shitty things happen refusing to poke fun at them isnt going to change that if you cant crack a joke at something hateful then the hate wins because its taken over your life and made you change something to appease them theres a difference between making a joke about gay people and calling someone a faggot i can almost guarantee that not a single person commenting in response to that post was prorape anyone who was wouldve stuck out like a sore thumb and in the rare event that someone making one of those jokes actually is racist or sexist i very much doubt that downvoting their post on reddit is going to change that
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is one of the few times i could use this seriously though does she mention rape in that video it seems like this guy brought it up in apropos of nothing like just because its a woman in the video he can bring up false rape accusations furthermore isnt rape much more a problem then false accusations just like there are much more murderstheftect then people being framed for such crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is really stretch man if youre annoyed by certain dark humor i guess thats one thing but nobody in that sub is actually joking about rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,yet its blatantly meant to shame people for showing off their bodies nope it is not
ShitRedditSays,removed,so theyre laughing because a bot that usually says absolute gibberish made a coherent sentence
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does one own up to slavery they did not commit remember the thing called the civil war a lot of that was fuelled by slavery so many white man joined the north fought and died for what they believed was right and thank god they won and with the victory and with the victory many things changed slavery being one of them it finally ended on a massive scale anyone that was caught continuing to own slaves was anyone that was caught continuing to own slaves was punishedand the people not slaves were released so if were going to bring up the past and were going to generalize and reprimand and entire race for the bad actions of their ancestors we must also exonerate and entire race for the good actions of their ancestors the whites did cause slavery in north america they were sold by mostly black slavers in africa slavery still continues on a large scale in africa by blacks on blacks sadly but eventually the whites join forces alongside many other white and also some black and together they fought and died to abolish slavery in north america we have owned up to it or god for bid it would still be here many whites paid in blood or with their life if youre going to go along and hold an entire race accountable for the bad things done way in the past well if youre any kind of reasonable andor logical you will also realize the good things their ancestors did in the past as well
ShitRedditSays,removed,what if it is a trans penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,the op of that thread misread the title of the thread he is referencing and so did the op of this thread if they even read the title of the original thread instead of relying on ops interpretation the bot didnt generate a joke about rape porn people really need to learn to read the bots post means his wife was raped the day he made the post today he posted some pics to gonewild years ago they werent pics of his wifes rape because it hadnt happened yet so there is no rape porn involved in what the bot was saying whether or not this is rshitredditsays material depends on whether or not the person quoted in the title of this thread correctly interpreted the bots title or if he thought ops incorrect interpretation was correct im defending them because initially i didnt realize what op was joking about i clicked the title which linked to the bots post correctly interpreted the bots title and went back to ops thread not noticing that he had misinterpreted the bots title i thought by decided to share he meant decided to confess and when i viewed the post saying this was the fastest i have said holy shit and up voted a post i upvoted that person because i agreed with them when i saw the bots title i thought oh my god because i knew it was a bot but found it ridiculous that it could generate a title like that and i upvoted it because i upvote bots in the bot subreddit who post things that make senseare funny it helps with their rankings which are along the sidebar of rsubredditsimulator it can help other users find funny posts by bots more easily if they click their profiles from the sidebar it wasnt until i scrolled further down in the thread that i realized many people had misinterpreted the bots title and it wasnt until i scrolled back up wondering why many people had misinterpreted the bots title that i realized op had misinterpreted it as well tldr your righteous anger may be misplaced not everyone who said holy shit and upvoted the bots post was doing it because they thought it was confessing it posted rape porn
ShitRedditSays,removed,you ever heard of a joke oh wait probably not cause your entire life is probably about going around telling people whats wrong with them but yes you are correct i have turned their my existential loneliness into something to be proud of time to go on over to rsuicidewatch
ShitRedditSays,removed,he was arrested for trumpedup drug charges in a plea deal with staten island prosecutors orta will get four years in jail for pleading guilty to those charges plasse said that even though orta had been arrested before garners death the frequency picked up afterward so apparently the nypd has developed time travel and is using it to harass people or maybe this guy is not as innocent as you think do you have any particular reason to think the drug charges were trumpedup other than him claiming so
ShitRedditSays,removed,mad lads is another good one like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,how so targeting is not the only possible explanation for someone being arrested more now than in the past if he had a case he probably wouldnt be pleading guilty for years in jail
ShitRedditSays,removed,it appears you didnt read the article it wasnt only drugs two weeks after filming garners death from a police choke hold orta was arrested on staten island on charges of possessing a caliber norton semiautomatic handgun
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey just like to advertise httpswwwredditcomrleftwithsharpedge its a young subreddit which is like shit reddit says farleft more violent twin if that interests you mail one of the mods there to become a approved submitter
ShitRedditSays,removed,the more the merrier
ShitRedditSays,removed,because people who want violence against their oppressors are just as bad as them am i rights and wew lad for comparing us to literal nazis
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets just cut the shit here and say whats really going through their heads women are all bitches because they wont fuck me and made fun of my fedora in high school rather than work on myself i shall use my powers of evolutionary psychology to put them in their place qed whores
ShitRedditSays,removed,so apparently france is banning foreign funding of mosques really france
ShitRedditSays,removed,redundant
ShitRedditSays,removed,aryan could you please edit this out thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,no i dont think any credit should be given to the woman wearing the security tshirt she put paying customers between her and the threat she had no intention of performing her duties the only reason this scenario played out as well as it did is because of the gentleman on the stool
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah youre right im certain her job description is to throw customers between her and the threat
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you lead with an insult and choose to ignore my comment youre really chalking up to be quite the white knight here she put customers in harms way theres no need to applaud her or assume she sent some secret code to the bouncer she did nothing of praise it does not matter that its a woman theyre an employee and they failed
ShitRedditSays,removed,have a nice day
ShitRedditSays,removed,unqueef for a sec isnt this kinda fucked up i understand not overriding black voices and allowing them to take the mic about this but why does that require physically segregating people
ShitRedditSays,removed,its islamophobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont get it is he replying to someone
ShitRedditSays,removed,cant call her ugly cant denigrate her intelligence what do you mean by this people can and do do both of those things
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is wrong with this exactly people arent allowed to have opinions on the attractiveness of celebrities anymore
ShitRedditSays,removed,you dont need to argue from authority here as a white guy as i said above i understand the need to ensure that black voices are at the forefront at the end of the day though the overall success of blm long term and actually creating change will require white people to join and alienating anyone doesnt do that would they force a contingent of chinese for example people to the back i dont agree with the reddit heat around this and i dont view this as overall a negative thing however it does not contribute to any unification of people under the blm banner
ShitRedditSays,removed,men need to learn that short haired women are beautiful
ShitRedditSays,removed,just like theyre in the same bus that makes it okay right
ShitRedditSays,removed,then explain that it makes sense then
ShitRedditSays,removed,it may surprise you but not everyone agrees with socialism some people actually like white supremacy fascism etc and think they are good things a gulag is where we put these people
ShitRedditSays,removed,navy names ship after harvey milk holy liberalism
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is it not
ShitRedditSays,removed,liberal i dont care what you think anarchist anarchists have done much worse to fascists than prison thats all the gulag was not saying i disagree just saying look in the mirror
ShitRedditSays,removed,when building the first socialist state in history you have to do some pretty harsh things like put people in prison and make them work not ideal but hey thems the breaks i dont know i assume youre going to tell me
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not a joke as much as it is history
ShitRedditSays,removed,where are they asking for the limelight though my understanding is that everyone is there because they believe in equality so why doses it matter where they stand
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love this subreddit its a good chance to watch whales at natural habitat
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,still applies
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you aware that the us is majority white are you aware that when you adjust the rate by proportion all of your statistics show minorities being much more likely to do all the shit you listed facts are hard i know
ShitRedditSays,removed,shutup faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,but at the same time i dont go out declaring that i will never date a trans person or a random racial minority etc because they might not be my type because why you really should amend your statement to include women it seems exclusionary otherwise
ShitRedditSays,removed,honest question what the fuck is that girl even doing she seemed oblivious both to the weird creeper trying to film her and the multiple people trying to help her out
ShitRedditSays,removed,this answers are the kind of things that gets me up in the morning
ShitRedditSays,removed,all the beta males on this sub are fuckin pissed that their wank time was interrupted by someone who is actually athletic enough to ride a bike
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes an incarnation of not all of reddit lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,i never understood this argument hes just using it as a metaphor to make a point their intent was not to draw a relationship between faeces and people from middleeastern countries
ShitRedditSays,removed,while simultaneously comparing them to shit thats the part i dont agree with you dont have to agree with their point but their point wasnt to draw the similarities between faeces and people from middleeastern countries it was just a way to illustrate a point
ShitRedditSays,removed,well what he said is a statistical fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand this video at all why is she just doing that stuff in the middle of what seems to be some sort of public square she must notice the guy filming her and she doesnt stop or confront him whats going on
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a melodramatic idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,honest question how can you support the idea of bringing in horrible murderous muslim immigrants into europe what used to be peaceful society is now a war zone with daily beheadings shootings suicide bombings and murder rampages
ShitRedditSays,removed,inside a child molester its too dark to read
ShitRedditSays,removed,being in bct for months does not make you a soldier stop using it to try and boost your argument
ShitRedditSays,removed,while completely ignoring the fact that he was mistreated and discriminated and driven to suicide because of his islamic faith
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do you pr
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow the amount of sjws in this post is depressing you know why most men hate females in the military because a vast majority not all mind you there are some fucking kick ass rosies out there are sluts in uniform who will sell their pussy for the lowest bidder i was honored to serve with a few rosies who were awesome most either found a way to get pregnant as soon as a deployment came up or found other ways to avoid strenuous work
ShitRedditSays,removed,been arguing with this fuckboy since yesterday not gonna back down
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean she was fb messaging the dude after the alleged assault asking him to come over and fuck me in the butt
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre not a former soldier you pussyd out during basic haha its obvious that this hatred you have for the military comes from deep inside you you failed and you resent that about yourself but instead of looking inward at the source of the failure you lash out at the institution that you were too weak to join
ShitRedditSays,removed,paragragh this is what he was talking about also believe me if you want out of bootcamp just say i want to kill myself known like recruits do that and instantly were watched by firewatch all night a seperated from the platoon
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you remove it or the did the mods
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dunno if this makes you a pedophile i do not want to apologize or make excuses for abuse but it occurs to me that looking at your little sisters vagina at years old or touching yourself while lying next to your sister as a teenager is likely pretty common and non destructive behavior in most cases if this is off base can someone please help me see why
ShitRedditSays,removed,spoken like a true edgy year old with no real world experience adorable
ShitRedditSays,removed,the medium is only good for propaganda passiveaggressive bitching
ShitRedditSays,removed,i must admit thats a new one lol straight privilege
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuckin cheerleaders man same with ballet dancers theyre ridiculously tough and not to be fucked with its safe to fuck with other weak people good to know thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,what takes real work is jumping to conclusions about other peoples inferior moral standing while unintentionally patting yourself on the back
ShitRedditSays,removed,listen to his albums specifically my beautiful dark twisted fantasy
ShitRedditSays,removed,on the stabbing of a jewish girl in her bedroom the mother of the murderer called her son a hero for killing the girl and the palestinian authority and fatah is honoring him by declaring him a martyr how horrible must a crime be for the palestinian authority fatah etc to denounce it at utc moloken replied to allegedly the mother of the murderer called her son a hero for killing the girl and the palestinian authority and fatah is honouring him by declaring him a martyr if this is true how horrible must a crime be for the palestinian authority fatah etcetera to denounce it ive seen israel take action against their own when will the palestinians do the same couldnt they at very least stop praising acts like these
ShitRedditSays,removed,he failed to complete bootcamp therefore he is not a fellow marine
ShitRedditSays,removed,the illegal israeli occupation of palestine is one of the worst genocides of our time it is shocking how the vast majority of americans who claim to be the leaders of the free world condone the deliberate murder of palestinian civilians by the farright government of a racist bigoted illegal country
ShitRedditSays,removed,mbdtf makes it pretty clear through lyrics runaway and power are probably the best example at the very least hes self aware
ShitRedditSays,removed,you havent even met me you sound like an asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,medically discharged dont you mean washed out like a bitch
ShitRedditSays,removed,so did you guys watch the vid
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are my posts here always removed
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think continuing your subscription to this cesspool of a sub was a worse decision
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know im not even completely with this sub when it comes to lolishit i really dont mind the existence of drawings of anything on their own but holy fucking shit does the anime community shit the bed when it comes to that ranime usually shuns them when they come into normal threads my comments calling them out usually stay positive but theres a giant underbelly of people who near as i can tell are just there to fap to that shit bring it up everywhere and constantly defend it in increasingly creepy ways that sub has hope they were praising rezero for calling out and destroying the nice guy and the toxic mindset of many otaku but the kind of shit in the op is still around sadly its a really interesting community over there and it seems to be improving maybe im being optimistic to try and distract myself from the op but im hopeful
ShitRedditSays,removed,what exactly is wrong with this argument
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah thank god muslims have nothing to do with this muslims are more into the real thing you know like marrying prepubescent girls like their almighty prophet did
ShitRedditSays,removed,hot take even reddits progressive boards can be real bad on rgamerghazi i can banned for saying pedophiles should be punished when i complained to sls since they allow people to vent for that kind of stuff they banned me and called me a pedophile and these are the progressive subs brd
ShitRedditSays,removed,weebs should all be executed
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hate reddit reddit is the worst place on the internet everyone sucks and is cisgendered and white on reddit okay cya guys tomorrow on reddit srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,im already an archangelle do i still have to apply or does it get bestowed on me automatically
ShitRedditSays,removed,the teachers would be racist and treat me like shit if i ever defended myself i was literally physically assaulted based on race at one point i stopped going outside because they were so racist and ridiculous i remember one time some girl called me white bread and i retorted with ok burnt toast and everyone lost their shit and one of the teachers made me watch a black history month video while she got to go home guys im totally not racist i dont know why they would call me racist all i would ever do is just be racist idfshill double points for antisemitism honestly sounds like a and this is why i joined the kkk story
ShitRedditSays,removed,imagine if you werent a faggot
ShitRedditSays,removed,so two people here are evidently shadowbanned since comments and i can only see one
ShitRedditSays,removed,idfshill is very triggered by this link hes the most sensitive cracker dorito nerd ive ever seen
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait how do you go from im masturbating to a guy dying to please cut off my penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,sigh facepalms at the stupidity of redditors
ShitRedditSays,removed,agree
ShitRedditSays,removed,you choose to bitch about people on reddit instead and u are doing
ShitRedditSays,removed,million dollars to confuse the students about life even more cigender transgenderwhat teach them about cromosones in biology instead maybe he should learn how to spell first
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah im not being lectured on privilege trans issues or how chromosomes are totally the one true indicator of biological sex and gender by somebody who cant spell cisgender chromosome or privilege especially when that last one is in the very title of the post theyre responding to
ShitRedditSays,removed,a school
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck off with that shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow i dont think this person knows that women that are biologically female with no other disorders and perfectly capable of having kids can have xy chromosomes when this people will learn that not even sex is binary oh but that would break their theory that gender is binary despite the only need to be proven wrong is knowing that people that dont identify with either gender exist
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,id rather be a called a murderer than a rapist though
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fuck i swear these dumbass altright people are taking over reddit that thread is abnormally shitty even by average reddit standards
ShitRedditSays,removed,if its true you shouldnt say something like that if it isnt true just because you can doesnt mean you should
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is this a bad thing i agree why should a man face the consequence of going to prison for something he didnt do and the woman who was lying destroyed his reputation caused him anguish walk away without going to prison
ShitRedditSays,removed,paging umartinshkreli
ShitRedditSays,removed,hilarious considering the person you responded to probably sits in his moms basement living of welfare and parental assistance
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,most actual rapists dont even go to prison or face any sort of consequence if that is the case than that is sad meanwhile in the real world false allegations are already a crime i have no doubt that it is i just agree that it should carry the same sentence as the victim would have gotten if the victim got convicted because of the lie
ShitRedditSays,removed,i could also see how people could take advantage of the system it could deter women to file police reports when they are raped amplifying their already existing fears that nobody would believe them only now they could face criminal charges
ShitRedditSays,removed,id would be the first in line to be euthanized if that were an option
ShitRedditSays,removed,he got fired and was recently arrested and i think his company went under though dont quote me on the last part

ShitRedditSays,removed,genders arent football teams people are individuals nobody in this comment thread was alive in nor were their parents
ShitRedditSays,removed,what this guy said is misogynistic but arent you being just as bad by writing off every masculine gay man as being misogynistic like its one dudes comment not every gay masculine guy collaborated on this comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do you want to pay for other people to breed cuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,they were born with a penis thats a good reason to be ashamed
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow really have you not seen some of the sjws on twitter tumblr and youtube theyre all for believing that cisgender white males should have no rights
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao im not even harassing a woman im explaining to an emotional idiot that cant wrap their head around the predispositions they bring to the table who confuses feminism with sexism i graduated with honors im fairly certain ive read more feminist literature than you as well as participate in feminist social activism the reason no one takes feminist studies serious outside of feminists and academia is because idiots like you grab hold of bits and pieces of the social science and run around spouting half truths and then get pissed anytime anyone has anything to say different from your individual experience let me know when you put on your adult pants and decide to do some actual research into the ideology you so zealously fight for you lazy fuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,better yet im mansplaining your preferences do not dictate the behaviors of others not once did i say it was ok to harass women but your infantile emotional capacity must have caused you to read something else to return to my original claim im fairly certain location has nothing to do with it considering the fact that pretty much anyone would approve of someone they desired approaching them pretty much anywhere but my all means continue being ignorant you fake ass feminazi
ShitRedditSays,removed,ah the good ol fight the stereotyping with more stereotyping
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand why its shitty care to explain
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont really disagree with any of that
ShitRedditSays,removed,but it states in the title itself the whole reason for hiring the all black staff was to prove something to whites implying he made the choice of hiring only blacks in order to prove his point
ShitRedditSays,removed,im really looking forward to seeing hacksaw ridge
ShitRedditSays,removed,gibson said some shitty things he was deservedly raked over the coals for it but the sob as paid his due by now get the fuck over it i hope hacksaw ridge is a huge success as a big fuck you to the hypocrites in hollywood
ShitRedditSays,removed,being a filthy brown is no longer socially acceptable sorry bud
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true
ShitRedditSays,removed,please stop triggering me
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey voat isnt bad i love fph
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are you singling out white people if i singled out black people id get called racist why are you not getting called racist racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,it actually happens its really depressing to see people saying they have disorders to act cool when i live with depression and have never mentioned it on the internet well except for now i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,if i had a dime for every time black kids in the and complained about being oppressed id be actually insanely rich
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would if i could but unfortunately it would not be okay because im only
ShitRedditSays,removed,no i just hate fat people
ShitRedditSays,removed,i disagree with a lot of what i read on here probably because of the combative format but i still read it every couple of days because regardless of my opinion i should be able to consider what others think without becoming enraged by it ive said it before the down vote button isnt an i disagree button its for posts which dont contribute to the conversation if you silence dissenting opinions by using it youre killing half of the conversation
ShitRedditSays,removed,but youre on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,associating frivolous spending with happiness youre better than that
ShitRedditSays,removed,on a side note i would just like to express gratitude that we only have to hear from you and not actually see you
ShitRedditSays,removed,what i never said that lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,it was a joke calm down
ShitRedditSays,removed,wasnt amanda ross around in her good times they must have played a lot of games or nigel was retired an inferior human being for his comments maybe but not an inferior player
ShitRedditSays,removed,so are we actually on the side of the women from the hugh mungus video personally i hate when people make fun of women or circle jerk each other when they defeat an evil sjw but i actually felt bad for the hugh mungus dude i think the lady was way out of line after all it really was just some joke thoughts

ShitRedditSays,removed,is there an online course in hypocrisy all you landwhales take
ShitRedditSays,removed,instead of saying things like that you should try not saying things like that its almost the same except you dont look like a moron
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol what are you liberal
ShitRedditSays,removed,why ive never spoken to a tumor that willed itself into sentience before this is exciting
ShitRedditSays,removed,it means chill
ShitRedditSays,removed,most cities in india outside of mumbai and even in jhopadpatti you wouldnt want to ever walk barefoot do literally have shitting in the street though on its face this statement appears offensive when in fact its a rather factual statement that no indian would take offence at because its true
ShitRedditSays,removed,men of any color really who were raised right with strong father figures
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have no idea im merely going off of what ive seen in india and what is regularily being reported in the indian media as a potential health hazard and cholera epidemic
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i saw a news story the other day about the indian government running a campaign to convince people to use toilets instead of the street so yeah this guy is actually telling the truth
ShitRedditSays,removed,im fine with mankind its people i hate
ShitRedditSays,removed,fag
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only reason to get your dick out is for harambe
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you for being a polite user on reddit this bot was created by httpredditcomukooldawgstar if this bot is an annoyance to your subreddit feel free to ban it or message me and i will add it to the blacklist
ShitRedditSays,removed,nobody ever claimed that
ShitRedditSays,removed,d actually as feminist as i am i love this d
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is it pedo like this sub is so stupid sometimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,beepbeep im a bot your comment seems sad to us cheer up have a ps this bot is powered by ai httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcejlvmnrty
ShitRedditSays,removed,lies women cannot into space
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wasnt aware of this case is this more testosterone true or the guy got the number from his ass
ShitRedditSays,removed,since the guy deleted his comment what did he say
ShitRedditSays,removed,your comment wasnt misinterpreted the neckbeards are just upset and attempted some unironically pathetic brigade
ShitRedditSays,removed,canada australia america went from being nothing to some of the best nations in the world lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah bro lol lmao meme le white people lel
ShitRedditSays,removed,whiteness is disgusting isnt that racism like this post alludes to
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think the point here is that although she identifies as a woman she has an extreme genetic advantage over the other participants i dont understand how racism plays a part since reddit practically worships jesse owens but this particular issue far outdates this website testosterone injections are currently banned by the world doping agency and by its counterparts so a higher amount of testosterone is recognized as an advantageous thing and the other athletes in this race have no way of matching the levels that this runner was born with its not about racism or transphobia so much as this is a grey area and has been such since the as far as i can remember i think its great that shes allowed to compete especially since she was born with this ability and likely faces extreme amounts of prejudice in most aspects of her life but we cant ignore that it must be difficult to swallow for the other athletes
ShitRedditSays,removed,naw
ShitRedditSays,removed,its still racism to characterize members of a race
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh come thats funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,great as a trans woman i have one more thing to feel disgusting about and ashamed of thanks for clarifying
ShitRedditSays,removed,slaughter the bourgeoisie seize the means of production workers of the world unite
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe the activities were already criminalized before they became associated with blacknessyou know things like gangs drug use racketeering and homicide hey look heres another post to add to this toxic subreddit brb gonna go mine those feel points
ShitRedditSays,removed,damn my life sucks im going to kill a shit load of people to make it better the logic checks out
ShitRedditSays,removed,how ironic given people like you do the exact same thing when people that arent halfbrain dead prove it not only doesnt exist but its illegal

ShitRedditSays,removed,to what extent cents to the dollar oh god such a difference while its still unfair and shouldnt be anything less than dollar for dollar its something that exists and cant be controlled by any of us really theres already laws in place to try and combat it but that obviously doesnt change anything and the people that say that its like cents to the dollar or whatever the figure is are just blinded by their own ignorance and need to want something to whine about
ShitRedditSays,removed,its something that exists and cant be controlled by any of us really i shouldnt have said it not only doesnt exist in the first place what you obviously didnt read in my last reply is quoted above for your reading pleasure yeah it exists but nothing close to what a lot of people sadly believe to say it doesnt exist in any form will never be the case there will always be one gender making more than another just like the genders will never have true equality but to say it doesnt exist in the sense that its such a small figure its negligible is true and has been for a while
ShitRedditSays,removed,they should collab with thedonald
ShitRedditSays,removed,i meanbeach volleyball
ShitRedditSays,removed,society criminalized activities associated with blackness the inner city etc give some examples honestly curious quick now before poor me gets the hammer
ShitRedditSays,removed,i meant to post this on the blm post but i guess i dont get the purpose of this sub reddit i thought it was ike rcringeanarchy or rtumblrinaction
ShitRedditSays,removed,that quote really doesnt apply to this situation this subject isnt about race in the slightest
ShitRedditSays,removed,the bottom line is that millennials have developed a lot of poisonous ideologies unique to the generation generally speaking they value feelings over facts things like nonstop complaining about race integration in meaningless shit like movies or videogames or trying to fire a professor for not using their preferred pronouns things that im sure even you would find ridiculous this has developed into a real problem and its only going to get worse if people like you are this quick to chastise anyone that tries to point it out honestly the fact that you took the time to post my comment on this sub is extremely ironic i call millennials easily offended after they get offended by a costume calling them easily offended its just one big ironic clusterfuck and youre too stupid to realize that youre the butt of the joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,getting banned on that sub only makes my point stronger so thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,nobody fucking cares about your joke from a comment on a thread dedicated to said joke yeah no one cares
ShitRedditSays,removed,emotions are for libtards and women why am i so anxious and depressed
ShitRedditSays,removed,you forgot the reeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,if there is a source she couldve just sprouted nonsense cause of how when some offending pedophiles are caught they generally have lolicon hentai mixed with actual cp in their collections
ShitRedditSays,removed,amazing how everyone here turns into pearlclutchers with the only argument being made that its illegal when on any other topic that very argument is made fun of as just because its illegal doesnt mean its bad or of course the corollary just because its legal doesnt mean its ok so the law is just a tool of governmental oppression when you dont agree with it but when you do agree with it its infallible srs ladies and gentlemen
ShitRedditSays,removed,crickets
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant seem to find a link that seems to be the theme here
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont you think the situation is a little different when someones been sexually abused when they were a kid definitely it means theyre more likely to be biased about the issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,its insane
ShitRedditSays,removed,guys im pretty sure its a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,he knew it would be posted here he baited you guys
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow no one cares
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you ever actually interacted with another human before
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you honestly think a phd in gender studies is contributing to society though the only reason i can see this being plausible is the amount of money given to the university for a useless degree
ShitRedditSays,removed,fucking funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,im glad that entire sub is full of sexless thirsty dudes
ShitRedditSays,removed,no we get pissed off when women think that they deserve exactly what they want
ShitRedditSays,removed,her bio was pretty mean tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you really made them angry now pretty sure nobody read it tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,so defensive they linked in a comment from a completely unrelated sub and had a circlejerk cry fest over it oh wait
ShitRedditSays,removed,really you people are absolutely the worst
ShitRedditSays,removed,right unfortunately this is how all comment threads on srs are generally
ShitRedditSays,removed,this applies to all humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,why thank you im flattered
ShitRedditSays,removed,excuse me guys did you just assume the average rtinder users gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you saying men cant be raped or that women cant rape because both of those are undeniably false
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually it was a pretty good job considering it assumes a lot more than is said studies have said that men are probably raped by women around the same amount as women are by men however men are even less likely to report it because of how it would make the appear to their peers im not arguing about what rape is with you im arguing the assumption you seem to have that men are more capable of rape than women and therefore perpetrate it more
ShitRedditSays,removed,and if you need some reading material will help you get off your high horse
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay i dont really know how most of this pertains to the conversation at hand which is that the average rapist cannot be assumed to be a man considering the fact that according to the time magazines report about the cdc women rape men as often as men rape women im not arguing a case for rape on either side im saying that its not fair to assume man as a rapist when women are equally capable and are probably equal contributors to rape the reason you mainly hear about menonwomen rape is because of the culture that has formed and the fact that men are not as likely to report rape as women who are already very unlikely to report it each of your studies has to do with mens views on raping women i dont see how that correlates at all to the discussion it seems to me that you are now just trying to depict men as monsters who have extremely violent and aggressive undertones towards women in order to further your point that the average rapist is a male psychology aside that point may not be true
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets not get crazy here things would be better if theyd chill but i doubt the screeching manbabies are capable of good science given the blinders with which they currently see the world yeah white man are so useless in science black women have definitely helped in that matter more
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not it at all its the double standard a dude with a profile like this would be all but lynched and would definitely end up as a post in this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,so if i am laughing with a friend its never just for enjoyment
ShitRedditSays,removed,this comment is completely stolen from a former english professor jason p steed not only that but its nonsense youre a hack just joking
ShitRedditSays,removed,you really should have credited jason p steeds tweets here instead of brazenly lifting them this is fucking plagiarism
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub is a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,you cant just say shes trolling and be done with it you dont agree with her either so you have to say shes joking there are bad apples out there
ShitRedditSays,removed,attractive young white female is redundant
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are i once banged eartha kitt in an airplane bathroom
ShitRedditSays,removed,its almost as if the people who frequent rsweden arent a monolithic group
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think rsweden is entirely shitty id say its about as good as its bad actually so lagom
ShitRedditSays,removed,which music videos of his are you referring to just curious
ShitRedditSays,removed,cant see any pro torture apologists yet i may have gotten more radical during this election but you wont see me stooping that low
ShitRedditSays,removed,if anything the attack was ableist but racist how their only reason is because hes white suddenly oh no its those blacks attacking us for voting a nazi thedumpster makes me sick
ShitRedditSays,removed,he didnt do anything to deserve torture dont justify what they did to him i didnt say he did i said the attack was ableist they probably targeted him because he was special needs and wouldnt be able to fight back
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahahhahahah
ShitRedditSays,removed,what hope it worked
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats to understand about barbarism
ShitRedditSays,removed,and yet you spread your ass for islam how bizzare
ShitRedditSays,removed,kill all whities
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean the crime was racially motivated
ShitRedditSays,removed,white people really are the most delusional people on this earth
ShitRedditSays,removed,first of all what these assholes did was terrible i think theyre heroes
ShitRedditSays,removed,but he was also white
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly your mentality makes me sick
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets stop acting as if this is a reaction on behalf of an angered antitrump populous these were sick deranged kids who are in custody and will be tried and dealt with now i feel its important we know what will come of this thread blm will be tied into it by redditors and probably twitter i assume its already trending this is almost a given though we should acknowledge that none of the perpretrators uttered the phrase thank god or reddit would have crashed that jackass professor who spoke recklessly will be quoted that mtv video will rear its ugly head again as if it somehow advocated acts like these ill give you that it was probably a reaction to trumps election rampant baseless speculation and vitriolic opinion will be ever present pepe frog meme now im speculating so on and so on until the thread is locked white peoples lives matter trumps life matters this kids life definitely matters all of us matter and we need to unify in the notion the victim survived and that these should be punished there are some people here almost gleeful that this poor kid was put through hell because it fuels their obvious agenda make of that what you will this is proof of nothing more than the savagery and cruelty of these people sjws didnt do this antitrumpers didnt do this blm supporters didnt do this and the movement will most likely condemn these actions publicly as well they should this whole race thing isnt a game were not competing for points on the board of suffering and victimhood this was horrible and has none of the nuance and subtlety or nuance of the usual incidences that spark racial discussions as of late lets stop the comparisons this was cut and dry sick individuals did this and the police thank god have them
ShitRedditSays,removed,what motivations are you even talking about
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not really sure what to say anymore isnt this what were against
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair fox isnt news just horrid little boys pretending
ShitRedditSays,removed,being that this kid hasnt shot an armed kid or the like will the klan still take up donations for him just a thought
ShitRedditSays,removed,you want to be oppressed so hard that you cling to every thread of evidence of your oppression no matter how farfetched or imaginery it is oh the projection
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes got a good point
ShitRedditSays,removed,well was she
ShitRedditSays,removed,at the rate things are going ill feel like a colored person soon stopwhitegenocide
ShitRedditSays,removed,well it certainly wont exist once america is white again
ShitRedditSays,removed,gaming really is the common denominator think its the lack of social life and the isolation born from that that it represents more than the gaming itself
ShitRedditSays,removed,wtf does this even mean
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually though why wouldnt they
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt people that dont know theyre racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,opressed
ShitRedditSays,removed,is that the sound of triggering intensifies
ShitRedditSays,removed,at least not ones that matter
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh im kind of giddy tho
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is
ShitRedditSays,removed,what about this comment is srs worthy
ShitRedditSays,removed,its almost like a mentally handicapped person got kidnapped and tortured for being white
ShitRedditSays,removed,why was this posted to srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know this place is satirical sometimes but isnt that kind of what this sub does to trump supporters brand them wirh one brush im confused now as much hate as this sub got you guys were consistent but now its becoming real hypocritical i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,i really dont get why so many people dislike lily allen
ShitRedditSays,removed,in sweden the conservative and alt right movement was almost non existent in parliament until there was a small christian democratic party the held some conservative views on abortion and gay rights but even when they became part of the governing right wing liberal coalition liberal being right wing compared to social democrats in a european context they where too weak a force in government to make much difference in sweden legalized same sex marriages under their rule which just shows how weak they where compare to their coalition partners in however the sweden democrats sd gained access to parliament with around of the vote sd was founded in by neo nazis since the party had tried to move away from outright nazism today they are for example very pro israel at hteir heart they are stil very anti immigrant and very islamofobic however in the election they doubled their vote to almost so far all other parties had refused to talk to the party citing their racist background as well as the numerous examples of racist remarks by prominent members today things changed with the refugee crisis sweden has for a long time had some of the most welcoming policies in europe towards refugees this was upheld even with sds growth since the greens struck a deal over the isle with the liberal government when the greens got into power with the social democrats in a part of the green platform was to preserve that liberal policy which the social democrats agreed to the atumn of sweden took in almost refugees in the space of three months for the year in total sweden has a population of million so thats like if the usa would recieve over million refugees in a couple of months many european countries had troubles dealing with the refugees coming but sweden took in the largest numbers based on population it was unsustainable we where running out of houses the migration board hired anyone they could and was stil overloaded with work all the swedish parties changed their attitude towards immigration this atumn eventually the socialdemocratic and green government scrapped their open doors policy and made it as hard and undesireable to come here as a refugee as the eulaw allowed the right winged parties wantet to go even further and sd grew to around in polls thats pretty much where we are today most people expect that by the right winged coalition will get into power with sds implicit support in exchange for harder immigration laws and possible less welfare for the immigrants that have already come as for lgbtq rights i dont expect them to be much effected the comming years but who knows things can change fast is one thing i have learned
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is a leftist circlequeef much of the more extreme rhetoric is hyperbole or only realistic in equally extreme contexts that being said truly dangerous and aggressive fascists are incompatible with peaceful egalitarian human societies i certainly dont want ignorant working class trump voters dead because they are victims of populist propaganda and capitalistic toxicity that is deeply ingrained and indoctrinated within the lower classes the ruling class intends this and its by their design many of the trump voting demographics are potential allies to leftist ideology if given the opportunity and correct information solidarity and intersectionality is possible but it is not going to be easy to undo lifetimes and generations of working classpoor divisive propaganda fed to them throughout history by the oligarchal system the ruling class does not under any circumstances want the majority of the population uniting against their true common enemy this would threaten to dissolve their fundamental economic and socialpolitical power over the masses and resources now when leftists talk seriously about killing fascists its as a last resort especially if civil war is inevitable the basis of fascist ideology and true unrepentiveirredeemable ideologues is oppression and aggression towards those deemed unworthy of civil rights or even life by their superficial and illogical criteria this includes the most vulnerable members of society like the disabled and sick i shouldnt have to mention racial groups those of differing religious beliefs lgbt or anyone who does not fit into their ideal homogenous fantasy you get the idea their intolerances are not based in reality whatsoever fascists want certain people who cause no harm to others eradicated from society this can be considered nothing but fundamentally aggressive and destructive to humanity and deserves absolutely no tolerance the most dangerous and destructive followers of fascist ideology are the ones who are effectively unchangeable their minds are made up and reeducation is not possible sure they could be locked up for life but they are still a risk to society they would still be able to spread their cancerous ideas to other criminalsenemies of society and organize fascism needs to become extinct as quickly as possible essentially eliminating fascists is considered straight up self defence they are the aggressors and should be treated accordingly even hitler himself had said that the only way to stop his movement was to strike it down quickly with the utmost ferocity violencein retaliation to aggression is the only language an ideology centered around violence and oppression truly comprehends ill ask you this do you not think violence was ever justified in abolishing chattel slavery do you think the many isolated uprisings of slaves was uncalled for killing oppressors is sometimes unfortunately the only option those who benefitted from slave labor werent ever going to give up their privileges and power without a bloody fight i have a real hard time feeling sympathy for nazis and slave owners though given the chance they would not hesitate to escalate their atrocities and exploitative beliefs defenders of basic human and civil rights arent the ones you need to be worried about escalating anything especially violence when it comes to ideology as dangerous as fascism fascists escalate naturally on their own preferably slowly and unnoticeably no matter what actions antifascists take they especially love it when diehard pacifists enable their bullshit without a fight it makes it a cakewalk for them to obtain power and garner sympathizers imagine how much different would have been if the victims of nazi violence and hate revolted early on in the fascist movement and if the typical german workercommoner joined in i can not reiterate enough how important it is to quell fascism at any cost as early as possible you know what fascist enablers and apologists are just as dangerous as fascists themselves thinking about all this history and the relentless aggressive and inhumane nature of this kind of societal system that relies on mass ignorance and pacifismnaiveté of the opposition to grow scares the shit out of me
ShitRedditSays,removed,can you please elaborate on what far left group told you to fuck off im a communist and intersectionality especially when it concerns the disabled im disabled myself and trans communities is taken very seriously and equality is a deeply ingrained core tenet im having a difficult time understanding what far leftist would ever display bigoted naziesque slander towards you far leftist ideology is vehemtly anti ableism and anti transphobia and if it wasnt i wouldnt be involved in the ideology whatsoever
ShitRedditSays,removed,imagine stop assuming everyone is either left or right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i kind of agreed with sentences linked because i think
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do first world women want to be oppressed so bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,well minutes of googling proved that the wage gap is indeed a lie seriously have any of you guys even just googled it come on
ShitRedditSays,removed,black person gets shot by a cop in what appears to be self defense lets wait till a jury of peers decides kidnaps and tortures someone while repeatedly explaining your disdain for their race a la fuck white people we cant know for certain if this was because of race
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow really determined to flip this arent you
ShitRedditSays,removed,most ironic post
ShitRedditSays,removed,hah i like him
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean theyre right
ShitRedditSays,removed,full comment its not safe to be a white male in america hopefully trump changes that edit the amount of abuse ive received both in comments and in private messages make it clear to me that white males are oppressed in america and those who speak out are harshly silenced
ShitRedditSays,removed,omar thorton literally a years ago
ShitRedditSays,removed,was the cop chimping out shouting fucking blacks while doing it
ShitRedditSays,removed,you probably think that the person is wrong considering you block anyone with different opinions
ShitRedditSays,removed,am indian is a shit hole kek that place needs to have a massive plague to kill of of the population too many ignorant poor ppl
ShitRedditSays,removed,same reason why people lie about having a special disorder or something along those lines it makes them unique and special
ShitRedditSays,removed,i live in chicago i cant even leave my house
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean all those fake attacks like a black man spray paining racism the muslim girl who lied about her hijab being pulled and the film student who covered himself with fake blood
ShitRedditSays,removed,in very recent history if decades ago counts as recent sure however black on white crime has skyrocketed you cant blame black oppression forever
ShitRedditSays,removed,when trayvon martin happened that was on the news for months dont even go there
ShitRedditSays,removed,october
ShitRedditSays,removed,id be offering suggestions
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a false flag attack donald trump wants the national guard to step in and put us in to a police state thats something id say if i were on the right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think people hate protests so much as they think its a pointless nuisance that isnt helping even the organizers of occupy wall street are now saying protesting doesnt work
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi guys pls dont torture us whiteys anymore in because of a different political opinion t whiteys everywhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,it wasnt ok then and its not ok now though
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh there hasnt been a single word of this case here in the netherlands martin treyvon et al where always at least mentioned in the news here
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know this sub jokes a lot around about killing all white cis males its all or at least most of it ironically and to highlight how right wingers cant take a joke at their expense even when they claim that you can joke about everything but isnt our view supposed to be that its just joaks isnt a good defense for comments that normalize poor behavior i mean sure we normally have actions that reinforce systems of racism and sexism specifically in mind but surely violence against the innocent in general is also bad perhaps imitating the people we oppose isnt a great strategy long term whatever short term satisfaction it may give nobody here is happy that this happened except from some trolls that truly think we support or endorse this kind of shit true to the extent that this sub is for true believers only but i assume we get plenty of lurkers who dont share our views and this is still reddit a text based medium in which nuances of tone and body language are necessarily absent i dont think only trolls would assume that people here truly endorse the things theyve repeatedly said they endorse which is not to deny that there are plenty of actual trolls of course but still
ShitRedditSays,removed,apparently a world where black people can torture a white kid while yelling fuck white people fuck donald trump and have journalists and police chiefs argue it isnt a hate crime
ShitRedditSays,removed,yall seem a lot more troubled by the reaction to this incident than the incident itself i know people here are gonna disagree with that but when you write one sentence condemning the attack and four paragraphs insulting those who were upset by it well i just call em like i see em im open to having my mind changed of course
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah but it exists so that guys rambling feels out of place and misguided
ShitRedditSays,removed,you sound pretty racist calling white people mayonnaise ass wouldnt you consider me racist if i referred to black people as coal ass
ShitRedditSays,removed,no it definitely was a hate crime and it definitely is a politically motivated move by the police what reddit fails to see is this is the norm when it comes to hate crimes against black people in america
ShitRedditSays,removed,hes right were in the most dangerous age for whites that weve ever lived in i dont live in america but im scared to visit it in
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not sarcasm
ShitRedditSays,removed,they literally said fuck white people while torturing the guy though how does that not make it at least partially about race
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol i mean this was clearly about race though the people in the video say fuck white people not really clear if thats the case every time a black person gets shot is it we usually have to wait for information about the situation to come out first while here it was pretty cut and dry
ShitRedditSays,removed,dude said she is a girl in the comment pls be more careful next time
ShitRedditSays,removed,nowhere in the definition of racism does it say anything about what you just said if you look at the definition carefully without moving the goalposts then you will definitely see that what happened in chicago for example is no different than a white on black hate crime of the same caliber
ShitRedditSays,removed,jeeeesus christ this subreddit is fuuuucked
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol did you just ban him for posting the definition of racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub should just link to all the racist nonsense you post here by far the saddest sub on reddit free speech is a disease and we are the cure how pathetic
ShitRedditSays,removed,whether the motivation was race or disability does it really matter disability is even worse in my opinion who the fuck ties up and assaults disabled people you have to be a real piece of shit to do something like that besides that someone who screams fuck white people and fuck trump with a white guy tied and gagged infront of them bruised and bloody is most certainly a hate crime i dont care why they said they did it or what excuse any cop gives this is clearly a hate crime no matter how you look at it and personally i hope acts like these keep getting treated the way the do because white people clearly arent putting up with it anymore people are in for a rude awakening in the near future
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao i dont think saying that it would be beneficial for immigrants to learn english is inherently bad but it just so often comes from the very people who emigrate to places like spain and make zero fucking effort with the language also making it compulsory is very bad for a number of reasons but i wont get into that
ShitRedditSays,removed,what happens to be the issue with this if youre going to immigrate to another country its helpful to at the very minimum know their language if youre going to live in a country where the primary language is x you should learn x if only for the purpose of communication
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly if the motivation is racial they shouldnt even be charged with a hate crime hate crime laws are to protect poc not fucking white ppl
ShitRedditSays,removed,you lose credibility when you say mayonnaise asses
ShitRedditSays,removed,well in terms of humanity come on man
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do they say a bunch of racist shit in the video then
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair that is not an excuse
ShitRedditSays,removed,tell blacks to stop killing each other
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok heres our agenda killallwhitemales
ShitRedditSays,removed,seems ive upset someone enough to warrant a whole thread alright then
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt know cucks listened to streetpunk skrewdriver is a way better band
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey boss you got cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,galaxy of heroes has made me its bitch
ShitRedditSays,removed,that is because you have no ideea how they are because they are not treatening your doctors if you do not save their relatives because its not in your country where they gather outside hospitals and make noises all night it is not your country where old girls are forced to marry because that is tradition you go in jail for that shit but they still do it and if caught they will deny everything because it is your country where they mutilate their legs and force their own to beg they force their children out of school to beg depsite being mandatory and free we have rroma only place in higher education those are free they only need to pass a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiromanianbaccalaureate while others need a much higer mark and still of those places are occupied most of them by people who are like rrom it isnt you country where rroma law is more important than actual law but you know we are all a bunch of racists and xenophobes all those countries with different experiences who had immmigrants they all have the same attitude yeah it is all because they are all racist and has nothing to do with they cult like attitude towards anything that is not according to them
ShitRedditSays,removed,maybe im reading this wronf but it seems that the comment is more about calling the op out for adressing a nonissue and not how a jane bond is impossible
ShitRedditSays,removed,and then you have the real garbage fires like bronies
ShitRedditSays,removed,excuse me
ShitRedditSays,removed,why
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree most oppression in the world started with people posting there opinions on websites
ShitRedditSays,removed,so years days hours and minutes old is a child what happens at the final minute that radically changes you into a beautiful fully functional adult now im not saying that its ok to sleep with year olds maybe its not even ok to sleep with year olds what happens when someone decides that the age of adulthood is its not something that is that black and white everyone matures at different ages
ShitRedditSays,removed,the same not at all but you cant argue that they dont share similarities did you actively decide what sexually attracts you i didnt i dont know anyone who did im pretty sure one day you saw something that triggered a response in your brain that told you i want to do sex stuff with this type of person imagine living in a society that told you what you find sexually attractive is wrong and unacceptable that you are less than everyone around you because of something you have no control over man that sounds a lot like what homosexual people the world over have been going through for a while well its also what someone who ends up being a pedophile goes through now its not the same in that one is a consensual relationship between two loving adults and the other is someone taking advantage of a child but they are similar in there own ways
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ youre a liar look at your last post historical revisionism drama erupts up in rtodayilearned after someone praises the actions of the british in india
ShitRedditSays,removed,not really its simply trying to understand something so to better deal with it considering just throwing these people in prison and demonizing them has done nothing to stop it from happening im just saying that maybe if we tried to understand what makes people do these things it might have more of an effect maybe we should look into treating the disease and not just the symptoms
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry i had to read through my previous comment where i said to just ignore the fact that they are fucking children and just like i thought it wasnt there im only stating that whatever makes someone attracted to a specific gender hair color body type etc is the same thing that is going to make someone into a pedophile and that the key to protecting our children is understanding those similarities and differences better so that we might be able to identify people that might have a predisposition to pedophilia before they actually harm another person
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not a defense of pedophilia it is a defense of those suffering from it it is wrong and unexceptable and we need to understand what is wrong fundamentally with the people who dont see it as such so that we can try and treat them
ShitRedditSays,removed,its almost like reddit it full of different people
ShitRedditSays,removed,adoption is a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,removed,guys hesshes joking look at the op of the thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,what other genders are there
ShitRedditSays,removed,so agenders have like no genetalia probably a stupid question what genetalia do third gendered people have
ShitRedditSays,removed,i bet the feminazi was paid by ctr hacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok ill bite whats wrong with pointing out the silliness of most major religions ducks
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this on the front of this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty clearly sarcasm
ShitRedditSays,removed,because its funny offense is not given it is taken
ShitRedditSays,removed,offense is not given it is taken quit being offended on behalf of black people we dont need nor want you to be offended for us
ShitRedditSays,removed,your true statement is wrong because of something you did months ago in reply to on most of the time its caused by them not us in fact percent of the time its caused by them even when you explain your behavior they still go at it at utc wrote what are you talking about httpiimgurcomloxxyolpng
ShitRedditSays,removed,yet you are doing the same thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,people who please my peen and whres
ShitRedditSays,removed,let me play naive for a second can someone refute it
ShitRedditSays,removed,ignores the fact that the origional had to create an ip while dikebusters used the fame of the original ghostbusters to push thier movie
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was born with a complete knowledge of everything wow finally someone i can relate to also im a gemini but everyone else thinks im more in line with cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,omg the butthurt is so real
ShitRedditSays,removed,and how is this exactly shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are only two genders there are countless mental illnesses where people think they somehow have found an additional one like people identifying as attack helicopters this sub is fucking hilarious lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just want to defend my comment that got posted here the point i was making was that this british paper seemed to focus on the younger ages which is the legal age of consent in brazil it wasnt until the second half of the article that it talked how the girls were tricked into it and the end of the article where it talked how they were now prisoners guarded by thugs carrying guns wherever they went my comment was made in disgust of the situation that the media focused more on the age than the atrocities of modern day slavery sex crimes and human trafficking does it matter what age the girls are sex slaves are sex slaves whether they are or or age shouldnt be the deciding factor in outrage against these crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,he missed my point a sex slave is a sex slave no matter what age they are we should be outraged with modern slavery sex crimes and human trafficking these girls are not willing but the article focused on the ages before the second half talked about tricking them into it and the end how they were forcibly kept from escaping my problem was they made the ages seem so horrible age of consent is in brazil a year old having sex with anyone in brazil shouldnt be the big shocking headline the fact that there are such organized groups engaged in human trafficking within sight of the olympic village should be the outrage
ShitRedditSays,removed,he specifies islamic radicals ie extremists that is not the same at all as being antimuslim
ShitRedditSays,removed,the peoples of islam have more in common with us than for excample the french adolf hitler
ShitRedditSays,removed,has donald trump actually said anything bad about transgender people or are they just assuming because he hates anyone who is different to him he hates trans people too i dont want to sound like a support trump obviously not but when you end up an echo chamber of more hateful opinions than the man himself you might want to look at your pathetic life
ShitRedditSays,removed,watch the video get better context on what the op said i believe he meant that if the kid who was kicked in the video were his son hed do a lot more beating of the other person than the guy in the video did
ShitRedditSays,removed,france also has a huge problem with talking about real french people and people whose parents have come from another country they colonised countries then got mad when people from those countries want to live in france the only way to stop radicalization is through making people feel welcome in society not isolated and rejected this is a reason why not an excuse for individuals abhorrent behaviour just to be clear but being angry and then doing unhelpful things that just lead to more hatred and more terror attacks butttt noone listens to criminologists people just go with what feels like the right thing to do
ShitRedditSays,removed,in your second link france does have the muslim highest percentage of total population out of all european countries excluding turkey which is a muslim country so its to be expected
ShitRedditSays,removed,melt bitch
ShitRedditSays,removed,except he was white nice try though
ShitRedditSays,removed,the comment wasnt advocating it it was showing a problem in the content a few comments down there is someone with upvotes talking about how shitty it is for the bar that it could be taken in that way
ShitRedditSays,removed,we should go down and really explain it to them with some bats and bricks
ShitRedditSays,removed,chill im not defending the person i just think that if youre going to mock people for being assholes you should at least do it right
ShitRedditSays,removed,ama please remember this is in relation to blmto and to toronto and canada and i have limited knowledge in the us movement
ShitRedditSays,removed,how stupid do you have to be to think this is in any way an accurate analogy to the situation at hand
ShitRedditSays,removed,it may be factually dishonest in that they dont have the highest percentage of muslims in europe but they certainly have the highest percentage of nonnative muslims in western europe you cant just lump in the exottoman eastern european countries where islam has been entrenched for hundreds of years when comparing france is a decidedly secular country and has the highest percentage of muslims amongst western european nations where at no point in their history was there muslim majority rule it may not be the reason for the attack and the statement is incredibly simplified but not necessarily misinformation
ShitRedditSays,removed,except it isnt there are more whites living below the poverty line than there are blacks of any social class yet compared to blacks and hispanics white people are vastly underrepresented in crime statistics poverty does not explain rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,the gender difference in crime stats only supports the assertion that biology plays a factor in black crime rates idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,which supports the idea that there is biological links between blacks and violent crime
ShitRedditSays,removed,this supports the idea of blacks being biologically predisposed to violent crime tbh fam
ShitRedditSays,removed,white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,i said we you sad bitch its not my fault you are on reddit literally every second of every day
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao at my stalkers making up shit about in other threads i had a response in cmv brigaded by some cucktakuinaction and theyre talking about how i defended casey anthony
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you have autism im genuinely curious
ShitRedditSays,removed,just want to say its great going to srs because you guys collect all the best jokes for my morning reading these line made me do a spit take bah bah booie bah bah booie i know this account will be banned but just had to share
ShitRedditSays,removed,you must be fun at parties
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmfao cry about it this is the internet reddit is shit are you getting paid to take it so seriously you do it for free im black and bpt never bothered me before i became a mod and it still doesnt if it was minstrel theatre then how do actual black issueseventsproblm posts get upvoted to the front i mean if it was a minstrel theatre then the whole front page would be mixtape jokes and side chick memes right i dont care how anyone feels about the subreddit or how its perceived im not about to sit here and do pr for a subreddit on redditcom lmfao
ShitRedditSays,removed,you trannies do realize that youll be the first ones thrown off of a water tower when islam takes over right
ShitRedditSays,removed,come on its jokes from trevor noah whos less funny that kilborne was and even at the end of the day its still just jokes maybe his delivery is just terrible i dunno but im white conservative and still know how to laugh at white conservatives we do stupid shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,this comment is incoherent
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually the victim can do quite a lot to prevent it you nitwit
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,im all about this subreddit so pleasebe gentle when i ask what is so wrong with this comment she goes on to say shes been sexually abused and hates how taboo the topic is that it was gritty like it is in reality
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you consider mansplaining to be serious issue i will lend you my gun and bullet and you do the job yourself you really do want to eat a gun for breakfast dont you
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is not at all a viewpoint that is raceexclusive get out of here with that bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,men do have a similar issue its called serious burning shits every monday morning during football season ever see what buffalo wild wings does to a colon
ShitRedditSays,removed,truth hurts donut
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think it is natural to be physically attracted to people who have developed their secondary sexual characteristics is some magical switch flipped at what is weirdmorally questionable is actually wanting to have sex with a year old after spending five minutes talking to them youd know youre in completely different places psychologically outside of the differences in your achievementsproblemsthoughtsfeelingssocial rolesindependence theyd be very susceptible to manipulative techniques that older people have already figured out theyd be more likely to form an unhealthy or unrealistic attachment anyone with a brain would sense that the argument that finding anyone under attractive makes you a pedophile is absurd id argue that it isnt consistent with feminisms focus on clear terminology and precise analysis it is not logical to lump year olds with year olds in any sense physically psychologically socially they are completely different i think the conversation is founded in the notion that sex is innately damagingdangerousseriousdirty which are cultural assumptions that deserve to be questioned
ShitRedditSays,removed,you really just dont get it do you
ShitRedditSays,removed,jess what is wrong with you people
ShitRedditSays,removed,so your source deems attraction as culturally based doesnt that go against the idea that people can be born gay same sex attraction
ShitRedditSays,removed,right if one were true than the converse would be as well i am not sure what you mean my bad faith so i cant address that but i was just suggesting is that a lot of people claim to be born the way they are gaybi or cis and i find it interesting that anthropologist would suggest otherwise
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes please
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck off from our sub guys that guy said it sarcastically are you so fucking dense take your internetbased meme culture somewhere else
ShitRedditSays,removed,its called a stereotype and most stereotypes are have some foundation of truth behind them
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes wont someone think of the rich entitled exploiters
ShitRedditSays,removed,stop moralizing he was and at a fucking bar im sure he wouldnt be a kid if his death fit whatever narrative you happen to be pushing he wasnt randomly killed he mouthed off to the wrong guy and got punched once maybe someone so frail shouldnt have been talking shit to someone who works security lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,still a victory for the working class let the wealthy parasites kill each other off will just make it easier for us to seize their toothbrushes
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre really naive if you think you can extrapolate my actual politics from my shitposting on reddit either way though im not going to shed any tears for dead bourgie fucks irrespective of if their deaths do anything to advance the cause of socialism
ShitRedditSays,removed,regardless of her job is she really that wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres proper satire and then theres just regurgitating reactionary talking points
ShitRedditSays,removed,i missed that part in the article is it from one of the sources
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont enjoy it i just like watching it sometimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry i know im not supposed to be defending the op of that quote as this is srs but i honestly do not know how to behave in front of someone thats trans three are some transgender people at my school and ive often contemplated striking up a conversation with them but i am unsure of something i say will be construed as hurtful or cause they to become mad at me so i avoid talking to them and i never learn what the right things to say are i completely understand where this man is coming from as i too have no idea how to behave around a transgender person
ShitRedditSays,removed,i watch a lot of stuff there is it really so hard to believe that people might be interested in content like that i find it really interesting
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this like the homophobes they hate against a group because they cant admit theyre one of them did you have a raging hard on before or after your comment lol just kidding probably
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry for the incoming offtopic aspie venting but my gears are slightly ground to see he posts on squaredcircle im a wrestling fan and i lurk there a lot and was just observing the other day how it seemed to be so shockingly unshitty for a community on reddit about a form of entertainment normally stereotyped as masculine and normally dominated by cishetnerddudes i mean its just one guy i guess but i hate seeing the curtains lifted and being reminded how shitty and gross this fandom im part of can be its like what ive seen on all the wrestling forums ive posted and lurked at outside of the way over the top perving on women wrestlers theyre normally perfectly fine when the subject sticks to wrestling but go into the general discussion forum and see a topic that touches on something that antisj cishet male nerdom rages about and youre reminded quickly how bad it can be blah i just hate the feeling of being reminded of how close bigotry can be to you and not know it but i guess its for the best treating bigotry like some distant inhuman boogeyman you never have to deal with directly doesnt address the problem and its a big part of why so many people never analyze their own underlying bigotry and privilege so these reminders might be uncomfortable for me but good for me too and its my own privilege that i can so easily forget about oppression when it isnt right in my face
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair that dude really does look like trey parker
ShitRedditSays,removed,it has nothing to do with race it was reference to a movie
ShitRedditSays,removed,i like to belittle my gf as well sometimes i think its funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,further down stereotyping asian women as bad drivers just fuels ignorance im half asian and my mom and sister drive just as shitty as any other woman ive been in the car with gilded dae women and asians are le fucking retards xd
ShitRedditSays,removed,gay
ShitRedditSays,removed,ban porn now
ShitRedditSays,removed,the users account has been banned from the reddit platform over the comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty sure it was more like q what comedians do you not find funny a amy schumer response to above she was funny but now shes stuck on the same line over and over im a who has a lot of sex joke about sex a valid criticism of her comedy response to above is really generous hes right response to above a is generous shes a wasted guys fall back girl this means that they were critiquing the comedy because thats the point of the discussion within that critique there was an error about her looks amy isnt a then more people started talking about looks because thats where the conversation evolved to conversations do that they evolve nice job trying to assert that claim which i dont agree or disagree with with an ill informed or intentionally misleading comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean that comment wasnt tearing down anyone nor was it attempting to justify it due to her past the person just stated facts of her life and tried to make an assumption on her mental state
ShitRedditSays,removed,you got the idea
ShitRedditSays,removed,genuine question what do prospective gender studies students imagine their career paths will be i dont pretend to understand it and if you can make a living then fair play to you just how
ShitRedditSays,removed,wouldnt that be nice heck id register for the gulag myself if itd take all these idiots down with me
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is the most logical conclusion whether or not you agree with it
ShitRedditSays,removed,people who bitch about their tv shows being interrupted by breaking news make me roll my eyes i never thought that the op would make me sympathize with that group
ShitRedditSays,removed,i usually always disagree with whoever is using the term sjw not because of that but because its usually some crazy altright trumpet but i do have to admit that he may have a point here who the hell gets a gender studies degree and how to you make a life for yourself with that
ShitRedditSays,removed,funny af
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do you say so not disagreeing just never put much thought into it before i always thought it was just a sort of dark sarcastic humor kind of thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,do what you need to be happy you deserve it
ShitRedditSays,removed,but im black though
ShitRedditSays,removed,they made a dumb newpaper comic style fluffy nothing of a joke into something edgy and funny and it offends you because youre a modern day soccermom
ShitRedditSays,removed,hilarious satire srs is the beacon of comedy
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you just assume my gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,umm so on the one hand you say these jokes arent funny and on the other hand you say yet reddit thinks this is like tip top comedy which makes the first sentence invalid what you actually mean then is that these jokes arent funny to you personally and as you are offended by it you think that jokes like this shouldnt be made which is ridiculous
ShitRedditSays,removed,just because you dont find it funny doesnt mean it isnt basically what you are saying is that everyone who doesnt think like you must therefore be a shitty person well i for one think that humor shouldnt offend anyone and no joke is offlimits pushing the envelope on whats acceptable is the nature of humor that makes me a shitty person or broken ricky gervais must also be broken by your standards then and anyone who likes him or a large part of standup comedy in general come to think of it
ShitRedditSays,removed,hates on any poc that doesnt think as they were instructed goes through others post history collecting whatever irrelevant points they can and resorts to childish namecalling when btfo because defending their hypocrisy is too difficult diagnosis latestage rabid authoritarian sjw
ShitRedditSays,removed,not loving meme arrows keep telling those poc how to think
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is true though
ShitRedditSays,removed,or wait for them to upload thier own crazy bullshit and just easily refute thier bullshit points
ShitRedditSays,removed,pedophilia is hardwired rape isnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,the person who runs xhamster must be a total loser i guess the weak beta loser could not get laid and banning rape porn was his only chance in the world for begging for a handjob from a fat disgusting looking feminist hate group loser
ShitRedditSays,removed,it certainly is
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair that woman is insane she looks up to hitler
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean that woman is pretty fucking irrational but reddit does have a problem with making it seem like all women are like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,can someone explain to me why is this linked here the post says that besides your chromosomes nothing really makes you a man in the sense that theres no such thing as real men
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry but i have to disagree with you while i think its beyond stupid that redditors will apply this to all feminists i do see all of those things happen often at all feminism events i attend you could also apply that same argument to rape culture you dont see many videos of men talking about how rape isnt that bad but that doesnt mean rape culture doesnt exist
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a zoophilic fucking kids is sick
ShitRedditSays,removed,look fedora youre just gonna have to accept the fact that because your grandfather hit your grandmother with an open palm one bleary night in december of so therefore you must accept all the abuse we funnel towards you even though we have never experienced any actual sexism okay and all these rapists out there give us every single right to rape you guys every day without any consequences s i fucking hate feminism period i dont care what anyone has to say about it fuck all forms of feminism except for in other countries as long as it focuses on both men and women
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry but you are a constitution thumping progressive you are simply wrong all terrorist acts have been committed by muslims with the exception of these school shootings and blah blah blah ive heard it all as a progressive so dont even bother you need to accept hard facts syrians and muslims are both very radical so therefore they tend to commit more radical acts
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats what upsets me the most one person does something crazy rather than laugh at the crazy person a bunch of equally crazy people use it as ammunition to get crazy angry at some nonexistent threat i guess all you can do is laugh
ShitRedditSays,removed,rnothingeverhappens
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is true i guess i let them slide because that shit was few and far between and he seemed like a standup guy outside of that garbage its the same with idubbbz he takes and makes some principled stands but then casually drops niggerfaggot and other dank channer maymays that torpedo his credibility
ShitRedditSays,removed,well redditors and anyone else openly flirting with fascist ideas are definitely something to worry about but the question is whether trump and by extension his administration are actually going to go that way recently hes backed up on the muslim ban and the mass deportation of illegal immigrants so it seems as though he wont he trending that way a menace to the environment and the economy a patriarchal bigot an antiintellectual sure a fascist well see
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,you seem like a cool dude
ShitRedditSays,removed,lumping people into general groups and im the bigot
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay did you read the updated context of the story the owners contacted to outraged poster and the poster has since apologize for the misunderstanding how am i a bad person for pointing out that people should not jump to conclusions then reiterating to the other poster that they shouldnt assume about my opinions
ShitRedditSays,removed,where else can i get news which isnt from default poop subs have you tried reading a newspaper
ShitRedditSays,removed,kasich couldve been the vp instead of pence brb just going to kill myself
ShitRedditSays,removed,reminds you that its the current year
ShitRedditSays,removed,am i going to get banned if i point out that it is in fact a pun can i screenshot this first
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont see it as a double standard i see it as smart people use the right terminology idiots use whatever word they like
ShitRedditSays,removed,that doesnt look racist at all
ShitRedditSays,removed,im asian
ShitRedditSays,removed,soooo there arent any such quotes then i cant see any in the comments here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have yet to see a video of hillary holding up the lgtbq flag proudly president trump on the other hand
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats very ironic considering that almost everyone criticizes this subreddit for various reasons
ShitRedditSays,removed,neither of you are welcome or wanted here you would actually have to provide something of value to the country and we all know that youre incapable of that
ShitRedditSays,removed,because my country isnt your safe space for you to run to when things dont go your way you wouldnt even be allowed to immigrate here anyway
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats what ive always heard guys say about height situations like this i wouldnt think it would be so shocking that it would be listed on srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,what the fuck is brd
ShitRedditSays,removed,so did you miss the multiple riots in the us by the very groups you are mentioning
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know what that loser said however i would like to remind people that the process of movie to canada can take upwards of years its not an easy process and i wish people wouldnt assume to be able to just move to canada
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry i enjoy following this sub its always fun seeing what you guys will react to next but i dont get this one wheres the bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow this makes even fucking better i feel accomplished now this is fucking golden
ShitRedditSays,removed,no because clinton is a lesbian by the way this was taken from rjokes good job srs good job
ShitRedditSays,removed,especially
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can take a dick but you cant take a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh shit now what are we going to do with our lives
ShitRedditSays,removed,your mom
ShitRedditSays,removed,its high time somebody show those pieces of shit what real violence looks like
ShitRedditSays,removed,whooo a mini michael or lindsay
ShitRedditSays,removed,how are you right next to a hospital not know youre at a hospital idiot she sounds like an idiot asking that over over
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this sub satire im new and im not sure
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dunno i usually side with the service worker in this kind of scenario we obviously dont see the entirety of their interaction and he is at least technically right that he can end the trip whenever he wants and she should have to leave his car im an emt so ive had crazies in back youre really constrained in what you can do without police since assault and battery lawsuits are so prevalent and sought after quite frankly freaking the fuck out verbally is a poor tactic but i dont think most people are trained or prepared to deal with someone encroaching on their property without resorting to violence let alone screaming and fuming that said that thread was fucking gross calling the woman horrible slurs and fantasizing about hurting obstinate women not to mention to dog whistles of ghetto and whatnot are not uncommon for male dominated reddit threads and these kind of videos are perfect for riling up reddits misogynist elements this seems to be a genre of internet outrage fodder male service worker refuses the demands of or brushes off a woman customer or something more severe and unsettling like this video and the interaction get filtered through the lens or men v women and people shout at each other on social media ive seen essays on jezebel the guardian and slate from the female consumers perspective and each time im uneasy siding with that customer even if i understand that sexism can infiltrate almost any social setting i just think that american consumerism is insidiously prevalent in almost every popular political movement the right to obtain whatever you want when you want it creates a bizarre and opaque power dynamic in the customeremployee relationship even in scenarios like this uber car where we see evidence of the man behaving in a socially unacceptable way but the woman is the one violating his space
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha eat a dick im not allowed to hate the face of someone who looks like a dog chew toy who also just happens to be a woman running for president
ShitRedditSays,removed,you feeling oppressed on the interwebs
ShitRedditSays,removed,loooooooooooool how exactly am i wrong open to some suggestions
ShitRedditSays,removed,that logo is pretty bad though they should make the garnish biggeroval shaped to make it look more like an olive
ShitRedditSays,removed,he was white
ShitRedditSays,removed,im just looking for more information im trying to avoid biases from media narratives
ShitRedditSays,removed,what does that have to do with this particular incident where the victim was white
ShitRedditSays,removed,i recently called out this user post history in a news thread that was linked on srs might be that
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sympathetic to the negative effects that shutting down civil infrastructure has on the community but yeah people took that shit way too far
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this shitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,he was white can you read
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol at all the legbeards in here thinking the victim was black
ShitRedditSays,removed,how about you stop trying to destroy their safe space it is important for people in communities to have a place to fully express their belifs without fear of scrutiny bigoted opinions or unwelcomed guests your unprovoked attack on their safe space is shameful
ShitRedditSays,removed,that kid wasnt black thooo
ShitRedditSays,removed,found the le freshman who just took stats you dont make comparison amongst two different proportions based on how their ttest is from the null hypothesis you dolt
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,except that you see his shoulder lift up and then shoot back down towards his waistband where a gun that would have sent him back to prison anyways because he was violating parole was stashed
ShitRedditSays,removed,you waded into that pond of the stinkiest most disgusting shit imaginable and thats the worst comment you could find that ones like a pretty little lily flower in the midst of all that heartless nonsense were you just overwhelmed and so grabbed whatever came into your hands
ShitRedditSays,removed,so youre allowed to use statistics if its against men but not if its against african americans
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think people are upset about her being right or wrong but that she was completely insufferable in the exchange youre going to be on gawker youre going to be a meme is not really acceptable in any discussion and it feeds the internet outrage machine to give her exactly what she asked for not that i agree with it but onto the issue of being angry at the hula dancer im not an american so i cant really speak to it but isnt the hula dancer a symbol of pride among the island nations i could understand if it was a symbol of racism or oppression like if he had a blackface mammy or a hooded kkk figure it makes sense because theyre political statements but just using symbols from another culture cant be offensive in itself should my parents take down their bronze depiction of the mostar bridge that they got on a holiday to bosnia what about their african art wheres the line from where something is personal and where its offensive
ShitRedditSays,removed,she went about it in such an awful way shes a perfect example of callout culture and i dont think she actually cares about making a difference it comes off to me like wanting to look like a socially aware person for attention and pats on the back
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow im cringing and laughing at once right now
ShitRedditSays,removed,lies through his teeth and conveniently ignores facts when they dont fit his narrative gee i wonder if this idiot is a regressive leftist liberal
ShitRedditSays,removed,id like to offer a polite correction to you but youre too crazy to get the message suffice it to say he wasnt trying to sound like nazi there i dont know can i wear your tinted glasses and see if i see the same thing
ShitRedditSays,removed,zimbabwe is a good example
ShitRedditSays,removed,it actually helped me too i get why some people dislike it but i honestly kinda miss it
ShitRedditSays,removed,someone linked a farright nazi website if you want to discredit a study you need to attack the methodology provide a study with different results etc they have different beliefs than i do doesnt really cut it theyre fucking white supremacists
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was actually very surprised at the lengths that not only the guards but these huge ripped black male inmates went to make me a lbs white guy at the time feel safe and comfortable while i was in jail for about a month and a half some of the nicest people ive ever met in my life were people who i met in jail now i know my experience is not universal and prison rape is a real issue but i just love to use it as the trolly counterpoint to these stupid fuckin mras who couldnt actually give about any rape victim whatsoever
ShitRedditSays,removed,and it has been the victim of numerous terrorist attacks mainly from uyghur extremists such as a stabbing attack at a kunming train station that left over people dead there was recently a suicide bombing at the chinese embassy in kyrgyzstan to say that china does not grapple with the threat of islamic extremist is incredibly ignorant
ShitRedditSays,removed,the blacks
ShitRedditSays,removed,i prefer thepc term filthy neckos
ShitRedditSays,removed,and whats to say the commenter isnt a teenager themselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,you are a hate group
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt the point of your subreddit to brigade threads doesnt this teenager have professional tattoos all over do you ever post and harass threads from rladyboners
ShitRedditSays,removed,can we get ben in here
ShitRedditSays,removed,fairly certain theyre making a cuckold joke on a throw away account i mean maybe not in which case more power to them do whatever makes them happy but since this is their only post and we attract a lot of trolls and cuck is the favorite word of the altright well im a bit leery
ShitRedditSays,removed,neutral documentary fan passing by something i dont get you act so proud about supposedly making the other side angry but you seem to be the one basically raging around all day
ShitRedditSays,removed,cool reply
ShitRedditSays,removed,shes and married
ShitRedditSays,removed,hence confused as in unattracted to the character but attracted to the woman playing the character i fear youre reaching a bit on this one
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh well in that case sorry for being suspicious hopefully you understand why i know some folks in poly relationships and ive heard it can get pretty complicated so best of luck
ShitRedditSays,removed,you wish i could be a cool reply
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you guys really all get this upset over shes an adult youre not even going to bother to check before all of this outrage that cant be healthy
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean i agree with the speaker though
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjqbsfkimrqa not a teenager
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha yeah all those pedos drooling over a teenager theyre so disgusting s
ShitRedditSays,removed,not really sure how that logic follows especially since im not even one of the people who commented in that thread i just factchecked found that the girl is and pointed that out in a thread where everyone is saying shes a teenager and calling commenters pedos but if pointing out shitty logic makes me a pedo then shit i guess ill be hearing from the feds shortly
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think it has more to with the fact that she missed an obvious joke and people think its funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,shes not underageheres her
ShitRedditSays,removed,she isnt a teenager though
ShitRedditSays,removed,the q is for questioning queer is a slur but if you want to continue to refer to others by a word they have repeatedly said theyre uncomfortable with go ahead id expect a person who adds an a onto the acronym to anyway lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,this thread is sad
ShitRedditSays,removed,the tattoos
ShitRedditSays,removed,the character is a drawing
ShitRedditSays,removed,or that one painting after the july revolution depicting lady liberty with one breast exposed like a mother caring for her newborn representing liberty caring for france and the values people died for creating the foundation of modern france thus being a better representation of the french people
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant believe you are a mod on any subreddit you said nothing of substance and accomplished nothing force together some more hot button buzzwordsyou seem like your selfsatisfaction meter is dangerously low on smug
ShitRedditSays,removed,butyou use reddit too
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol so what youre saying is that if a girl doesnt have large tits she should be considered under age and anyone who likes her should be considered a pervert even if shes actually in her youre a special kind of stupid
ShitRedditSays,removed,but this girl is not a teenager having a tattoo is not a guarantee of that but it is very uncommon to see an underage girl tattooed by a decent artistusually it is some guy they are trying to fuck using a guitar string and a cd motor in a garage you guys need to calm the fuck down with your forceful accusations it is pathetic that you just assume you are so much better than everyone else when you ultimately make shit up and stroke each other off about how right you are you people disgust me
ShitRedditSays,removed,huh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand the problem here this girl is
ShitRedditSays,removed,shes guys she is married with at least kid kid httpwwwfamousbirthdayscompeopletabithasharphtml
ShitRedditSays,removed,and its not the character people are attracted to its the cute girl dressed up as the character
ShitRedditSays,removed,the character is an imaginary construct voiced by a year old man some adult woman cos playing as this character in a rather sexual way isnt a valid detriment to anything i see no reason to make a post about it at the very least
ShitRedditSays,removed,cute of age girl dressed up like a teen character seems like a pretty confused penis to me
ShitRedditSays,removed,these internet points arent at all necessarily imaginary technical misuse of the upvotedownvote system taken into consideration its a very real indicator that a certain number of people agree or disagree with you and god forbid a term that includes the sexualization of yearolds not be considered somewhat normal
ShitRedditSays,removed,do i have to explain the concept of a joke to you seriously
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is what happens when society perpetuates nerds as socially inept weirdos instead of trying to help them
ShitRedditSays,removed,considering both enslaved and unenslaved sex workers exist this comparison seems reductive
ShitRedditSays,removed,are we not reading the question this is obviously racist but thats sort of the point of the post
ShitRedditSays,removed,impressive and at utc snotbagpukebucket replied to
ShitRedditSays,removed,i must break the queef on this the bombing was a necessary response to the end the war and save more lives in the long run if only society as a whole were more willing to embrace utilitarian thinking
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know im going to get down voted for this but my gf is the one with rapedegredation fantasies and asks me to participate which i dont mind i like communicating about things in a healthy way but some women are attracted and enjoy such things its not always about oppressing someone or being dominant i enjoy connecting with her and we both have a lot of fun together
ShitRedditSays,removed,hah thats not surprising
ShitRedditSays,removed,pbuf
ShitRedditSays,removed,well aside from the epeenmeasuring so beautifully described by an srser id say that post is about as accurate as you can get meh
ShitRedditSays,removed,white guys are the most qualified you sound racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand why you chill with the dg crowd fin
ShitRedditSays,removed,hows jellybean is jellybean good
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know that girl was asking for it
ShitRedditSays,removed,you fat landwhales
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope he crashes on his motorcycle and dies good riddance to misogynists
ShitRedditSays,removed,andrea dworkin called she wants her batshit crazy viewpoints back
ShitRedditSays,removed,how so
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok buthow so
ShitRedditSays,removed,báyanse a la berga yo solo me la quería jalar
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey i said that i feel proud to have made the sts highlight reel thank you
ShitRedditSays,removed,its funny how these people claim to be against racism yet they are judging everyone by the color of their skin
ShitRedditSays,removed,it feels like mras have taken over a decent chunk of srs there is no reason why a feminist subreddit should come out in defense of porn
ShitRedditSays,removed,ducks and dolphins both use rape very heavily as a part of their reproduction
ShitRedditSays,removed,did the feminists turn on your caps lock and then take away the key
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one fucking cares
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont fucking know
ShitRedditSays,removed,studies have shown that even softcore pornerotica is damaging to the human mind no porn is good dont be a mra
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont care the circumstances if youre an adult and you have sex with a year old you deserve death or at least a long imprisonment its fucked up that many european countries have this as legal behold the failures of sex positive ideology
ShitRedditSays,removed,i got banned from this morning and im not sure why ive messaged the mods a couple hours ago i hope they get back to me soon
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know we are being sarcastic right never take a paradox game seriously or you might go insane
ShitRedditSays,removed,am i the only who sees nothing wrong with thisplease explain bc im confused
ShitRedditSays,removed,hitchens actually had an interesting angle to bring to atheism as a journalist and longtime world traveler dawkins and harris have very little to bring to the table other than its science bitch while in general theyre right thats their only card to play and it gets old quickly and when it intersects with politics theyre hopelessly out of their depth but still think theyre an authority
ShitRedditSays,removed,what if the creator of the religion himself was an evil hateful racist misogynist rapistpedophile who called for the death of all nonbelievers instead of the other guy who preaches unconditional love for all people everywhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,the wbc is a tiny group of people who troll funerals for attention tens of millions of muslims would kill you for apostasy billion muslims worship a bloodthirsty child rapist
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you view muhammad to be the holy prophet and allahs chosen wouldnt you want to perfectly emulate him
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah if i believed in him
ShitRedditSays,removed,supposedly they met in a and over bar which means he would obviously assume she was at least i really doubt she told him or he knew she was until after it was too late
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha that was funny whoops im on the wrong subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,listen comrade ice picks are the correct way to purge undesirable political opponents and thats just the way things have always been
ShitRedditSays,removed,urgaypwned
ShitRedditSays,removed,you clearly have not meet enough jews
ShitRedditSays,removed,op needs his kebab removed
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow hes up to points now no wonder only neo nazis play that game
ShitRedditSays,removed,implying kebab isnt white remove kebab
ShitRedditSays,removed,if thats how the altright is recruiting people maybe we should cut it out
ShitRedditSays,removed,damn those white people we should put them in camps
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt a sticking a coat hanger around a really good way to kill yourself or fuck up your insides coat hanger method is stupid this is why we need safe abortion legalized so people dont have to do this
ShitRedditSays,removed,so who said that again and of course were going to come over when you call out a post on our sub the messenger bot lit us a cyno
ShitRedditSays,removed,worthwhile people dont become redditors like uamarrvektor this brand of posting is born out of being unwanted by society thats a little ironic considering this whole subreddit is just people being outraged and hating white people sounds like you guys are the unwanted of society tbh this little boy early awaits your response or more likely ban from this subreddit gotta have your safe space so you can call out and attack other communities while being protected from their oppressive responses
ShitRedditSays,removed,funny how when you read the comments of another community their jokes and memes can be stupid to you seems just like how literally every outsider sees this place as a racist echo chamber and embarrassing myself haha nah you see my comrades from reve are upvoting my posts and people from this sub i hope they dont like me i hope my moderate and reasonable words trigger them
ShitRedditSays,removed,oy vey u cant ban me im jewish irl so therefore im allowed to use terms that you cannot use
ShitRedditSays,removed,well it could also mean that you have aparticular culture or period generally more archaic means less variety you want to evoke or that the scope of your setting is not very large i personally think racial inclusiveness is important but i would much rather have a game that is true to its story and doesnt have other races as an afterthought imagine an afrocentric witcher for instance it might seem exclusive to white people but it would certainly offer some fresh perspective and content and there would still be the eurocentric witcher and for the purpose of integration there are a lot of settings where the integrity of the art is not affected by the inclusion of many races and genders and creeds and these settings are usually futuristic or modern which speaks to the fact that modern times and societal progression are intimately related
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know it doesnt but this can be used as a recruiting tool
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretending like theres such a thing as a nonbinary gender is silly bullshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am not polish but i live in country close to poland and if i had to guess less than of poles are people of colour why would polish studio or by extension european go out of their way to include pocs when most of the time they dont even meet them
ShitRedditSays,removed,no idea what you mean
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh so there is racial diversity then why are you complaining sarcasm for sarcasm also no orcs in witcher good to know that you know what youre speaking about
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know what is the point of throwing the list on me
ShitRedditSays,removed,dudei am latino and that is the saddest thing i have ever heard i really hope you are joking because if you are notwell i guess i just dont understand blaming myself for the worlds problems get some self respect because you are not helping anyone by feeling that way
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think this sub needs to be exterminated
ShitRedditSays,removed,mike brown was a filthy criminal
ShitRedditSays,removed,islam is disgusting
ShitRedditSays,removed,we can beat them
ShitRedditSays,removed,the witcher is one of the most popular games in the last few years gamers never had any problem with it conversely sjw darling clickbait site polygon lambasted the game for not having enough minorities despite being based on a polish series of novels that mirror medieval europe
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh put all together it seems a bit more convincing than the whole podesta summoned a demon or whatever thing which was just some piece of wacky performance art i mean at the very least the instagram account is a bit odd it is all super conspiracyy tho like they were using fucking numerology at one point
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure they do exist but theyre most likely a very very very small group of people confined to college campuses
ShitRedditSays,removed,probably not time to bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,removed,ninja info cards sorry i couldnt resist
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont act like your cultofoutrage echo chamber is any better than the alt right subs
ShitRedditSays,removed,e my the little boys are keen to prove my point tonight wait how are we proving your point us defending our community member is empirical evidence that white people have no empathy lady you need to chill out if it werent for this echo chamber your incoherent temper tantrum would get you destroyed on any other sub really we come over to defend our guy and you flip your shit and start hurling lame insults oh sorry i forgot to put a trigger warning at the beginning of my post my bad wont forget next time
ShitRedditSays,removed,name one benefit of multiculturalism besides food and music
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre letting them leave their thirdworld shithole and move into your nice free firstworld country how is that treating them like garbage
ShitRedditSays,removed,we need heavy fines on companies that employ illegal immigrants yeah thats not gonna happen plenty of companies have no problem hiring illegals while promoting their antiimmigration ideas
ShitRedditSays,removed,weird its almost like if you dont listen to the police officer shit goes south
ShitRedditSays,removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,dae creepy is what girls call guys who are unattractive and other choice comments all over this thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,the real irony is that you expect someone to read all of that tldr
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would it be banned
ShitRedditSays,removed,democracy is shit it failed fascism is the way to go and no im not kidding
ShitRedditSays,removed,sure this post has a low score but why havent we banned the baby fascist yet
ShitRedditSays,removed,but you all got offended by someone telling people not to brigade you so whos the average redditor here
ShitRedditSays,removed,pathetic
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously
ShitRedditSays,removed,techniqually imagine if someone was beating someonr else behind that woman she was infront the cop and thus the cop cwnt correctly control the situation
ShitRedditSays,removed,the weight loss subs have helped me lose lbs is why
ShitRedditSays,removed,just came for the ban pls mods
ShitRedditSays,removed,could they make their virginity more blatant
ShitRedditSays,removed,thought it was funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha you omitted part of the second quote to make it sound worse
ShitRedditSays,removed,meirl isnt funny to anybody except srsers
ShitRedditSays,removed,i survive pretty good its weird but good for my self esteem when people mistake us for a couple
ShitRedditSays,removed,or hes just happy to not have to deal with being attracted to his sister no yeah youre right hes probably an evil psychopath thats my bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,everyone knows women werent born with mouths until this modern libtard politically correct feminazi bs
ShitRedditSays,removed,just because someone is your sister doesnt mean youre blind to what they look like being able to acknowledge that someone is physically attractive is very different from acting on it but i can see i made a mistake posting here this subreddit is just as small and circlejerky as people say you automatically assume the worst in people and dissenting opinions are not tolerated i pity you
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is this not considered racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,please point me to where i said it was the worst thing today let alone the worst thing ever you are all hilarious sure im in the wrong for pointing out hypocrisy totally you people need to get fucking lives
ShitRedditSays,removed,source that while youre at it look at the dictionary definition of racism the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races you guys realize your beliefs actually help build racial barriers
ShitRedditSays,removed,how about we all agree that the content of character is the only method to judge another person if you see a white person and assume they harbor any racist feelings isnt that judgement based on skin colour isnt that a blanket generalization without finding out who that person is why not go out and experience people and explore ideas instead of what social constructs tell us
ShitRedditSays,removed,im disapointed to no end that people on the internet curious about socialism usually run into tankies and get instantly turned off from socialism anti capitalism in general nobody does a better job of keeping the left dead then you people
ShitRedditSays,removed,are we really posting saudi apologia here
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people are fucking retarded the whole reason this meme exists is because of hypersensitive sjws like yourselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean thats pretty accurate but no need to shout
ShitRedditSays,removed,til pornography is bad
ShitRedditSays,removed,you jelly brah

ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought that was about the sound many frogs make when they scream
ShitRedditSays,removed,the thing is sexual dimorphism is an important factor in these differences its common knowledge men are more agressive yto put it simply for example and add to it the effect of gender roles and i guess other social factors and this huge difference appears in criminality

ShitRedditSays,removed,oh yeah gun culture is definitely a bit toxic its usually fine though considering a good amount of people are safe and secure with their guns its that of crazy bogans and rednecks that tuin it for the other
ShitRedditSays,removed,btw being a hawk has nothing to do with left or right i dont even know why it is brought up all the time as something right wing
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know if youre serious but if you are youre a retard if you arent sorry you really convinced me
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is sarcasm right you know the whole sub is white people being awkward and goofy
ShitRedditSays,removed,honest question whats so offensive about this

ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds like projecting
ShitRedditSays,removed,out of the last comments you have made are in srs so it looks like you dont leave your safe space much either
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a bunch of hateful bullshit i know lets react with a bunch of hateful bullshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people are cancer can i please be banned now
ShitRedditSays,removed,failing to recognize sarcasm this hard
ShitRedditSays,removed,the proportion of things said on reddit that are serious is smaller than the proportion of intelligent people in a trump rally
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats certainly a creative interpretation of what i wrote
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you even read the article the man stabbed his kid because he wasnt studying enough that comment was just quality black humour just because its crass doesnt mean its not funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i knowright how dare someone want to learn and better themselves and demanding trans people answer the questions instead of posting it on some sort of forum where your free to ignore or answer at your leisure insane fucking bigots wanting to ask questions
ShitRedditSays,removed,dicks out
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol yall are fucking wackos
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats just because u want to be raped by black thugs
ShitRedditSays,removed,its unfair to ciswomen to have to compete with athletes who by nature are under the effects of testosterone boosting feel however you want about it but the female athletes competing in these races do not agree with the rules allowing intersex competitors as a woman who does a lot of amatuer atheletic competitions id be miffed if i spent the majority of my life training for my one shot at olympic gold only to have it taken by someone who has access to legal steroids genetics if we accept this than it should also be accepted for female athletes to dope so they can compete at the same level or maybe just have an intersex bracket as well
ShitRedditSays,removed,ughhhwhy are people still using freshmanfreshmen do people not know this is genderbinary hate speech
ShitRedditSays,removed,literally nothing to do with the linked comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,what if you condemn what a person says but defend his right to say it
ShitRedditSays,removed,quit being such a fag lighten up
ShitRedditSays,removed,give praise to the all knowing social justice warrior for allowing us to keep our privilege in check
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes being a white person who wants to travel to exotic locations is clearly a product of white privilege and not human curiosity or anything just like everyone else in the world who has ever expressed a desire to travel only the white ones though
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is everyone supposed to be friends if we arent even all allowed to use the same phrasing why dont we just disallow the use of words or manners of speaking that are forbidden to one group or another altogether then if relating to eachother is cultural appropriation then how is any progress being made were just building up more of a barrier between ourselves what is really so wrong with sharing culture with eachother more than half the time when someone is crying about cultural appropriation its not even the person whos culture is being appropriated its some buttermilk ass white girl who thinks she has to jump in and speak for those poor pocs who clearly cant think anything of it themselves your black friend who gave your other friend permission to use the n word clearly doesnt know what black people would think about that you a white person have got to know so much more to know much more about that
ShitRedditSays,removed,i laughed
ShitRedditSays,removed,the problem isnt one of disagreement it literally tries to silence people basically the that makes me have bad feelings so youre never allowed to aknowledge it or talk about it in case i hear you ideology
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty great counter argument you got there
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean why would black people wanna call themselves the n word why do gay people call themselves queer im just saying that if we start making up rules saying that white people have to dress and talk like white people black people have to dress and talk like black people and you can only have a haircut if it fits your race and culture then how is anything getting better
ShitRedditSays,removed,more like iq points
ShitRedditSays,removed,said on srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,so choosing to be overweight is a valid lifestyle choice but people willing to sacrifice their bodies for competition fame glory etc is messed up
ShitRedditSays,removed,i did
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh right you dont know what to say which means that nobody can criticize your position because you dont have one but youre definitely better than everyone else
ShitRedditSays,removed,rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,ada lovelace and grace hopper were definitely leaders in their field theres no question but there have been plenty of exceptional men too womens superiority isnt clear to me in that area as for banning video games i cant really support your position and to be honest it isnt really very well supported so far
ShitRedditSays,removed,what are you getting upset that i ran into you on reddit and ridculed you for a shitty comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,perhaps we should just ban the violent ones then
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know white people are all individuals and you cant paint them all with the same brush right
ShitRedditSays,removed,hope it was worth giving many of your employees ptsd and having to view child porn just to preserve the veneer of free speech yishan you absolute twat
ShitRedditSays,removed,and if you want to get anywhere in life youre gonna have to suck their dicks
ShitRedditSays,removed,ignorant of the fact that blacks are overwhelmingly over represented in crime statistics guess ill go don the white hood then
ShitRedditSays,removed,who was around on earth much longer than youve been but whose opinion and speech are void when they dont agree with yours
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah all whites are racist just like all blacks are criminals and thats why theyre racist in first place
ShitRedditSays,removed,men have more muscle mass are designed to aggressive compete and protect lol genders are a social construct men and women are exactly the same thats why women perform just as good as men in the military oh wait no they dont
ShitRedditSays,removed,relevant username just cheer up a bit lad try not to get so worked up about what others find funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,pedophilia because two years olds having sex is a pedophilia
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt antiwhite racists
ShitRedditSays,removed,the average man is more likely to be violent than the average woman just like how the average woman is more likely to be physically weaker than the average man its almost as if ignoring the difference between the is ignorant
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean i guess im wrong but i thought she was in her shes even got a tattoo
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha dude wtf white males are okay you sound like a fucking pussy to be honest kill yourself you whiney sjw
ShitRedditSays,removed,how can you say the rest of reddit is bigoted when this subreddit is built off of bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is that ive been a sub therefor a while and i havent seen anything like this
ShitRedditSays,removed,he thinks its rational to want to have equal rights between the sexes hes claiming to be against feminism yet also wholeheartedly believes in their one core shared belief how irrational the real problem with feminism is that equal rights for the sexes can be twisted into meaning just about anything which is why youre all in constant disagreement about things like the wage gap etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,white culture you are a christianophobic bigot in all seriousness though demanding reparations from whites will just cause further divisiveness in your country and make you look like a laughing stock to the people who arent equalist drones
ShitRedditSays,removed,things like demanding that hatespeech and hatefacts not be allowed to be brought up in public debates like using bigot or phobe as slurs in lieu of arguments like writing off anyone who disagrees with your group as a heretic and shutting down any conversation with them shaming isnt a word id use to describe it though that does seem to be the intention of those tactics
ShitRedditSays,removed,the irony
ShitRedditSays,removed,if emotion doesnt trump logic and facts then you dont get to pick and choose which facts you wish to ignore in order to fit your beliefs we both know that black men are the demographic that the highest proportion of criminal behaviour comes from per capita if you want to start making arguments predicated on generalisations about demographics then you ought to factor in either both sex and race or neither
ShitRedditSays,removed,no saying id never date a black person is saying that the hypothetical black person wouldnt be perfect for me in the first place im white and i want to have a family with healthy white children of my own one day which simply means that a black or trans person just cant ever fulfill that role as a longterm partner thats called a preference and cant be classified as any sort of irrational fear its the most rational biological desire to have
ShitRedditSays,removed,its probably just all those rape gangs targeting innocent girls that are rapidly becoming bolder and more prolific with their child abuse crimes and have already ruined the lives of literally thousands
ShitRedditSays,removed,opinionated definitely not raping her sister
ShitRedditSays,removed,cuck s
ShitRedditSays,removed,im genderfluid so it depends on how i feel at the time theyve caught me
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know who i dont want to meet in real life thecheeto of course it just so happens i live around fuckface pickup drivers with trump flags
ShitRedditSays,removed,leaders is definitely not the correct word here i think they just meant most vocal in which case theyre not wrong are they
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol this is south africa whites are oppressed there i cant believe this is a real post
ShitRedditSays,removed,glad to know that south africa is a atheist country because that is what the survey say right
ShitRedditSays,removed,careful with the ameriocentric way of thinking he isnt in a majority white country being from south africa he doesnt have white privilege there he is privileged being male
ShitRedditSays,removed,the situation in south africa is rather different positive discrimination is heavily enforced throughout law to combat the mass inequality this does mean however that in regards to applying for jobstuition etc it is much more difficult for a white man to be accepted over a black man dont get me wrong white people generally have the advantage everywhere else however there are real systematic disadvantages to being white in south africa nowadays
ShitRedditSays,removed,you dont say thats what wajormeasel said aswell check the sub to see how it is in the country it is well known south africa have these problems if you want to use the survey in one case you cant forget it in the other
ShitRedditSays,removed,once again you dont say you are supposed to look at the information on the sub not what everyone think themselfs it does not take long to find information on this on google either
ShitRedditSays,removed,this sub is hitler in person just kidding hitler gave people free gas this sub never gave me anything
ShitRedditSays,removed,op of previous post read this before you criticise
ShitRedditSays,removed,he lives in africa you dimwits
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats hilarious
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was one of the ones who gilded him it was my privilege
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont get it
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually i have a degree with a minor in wgs which is why i completely understand your nonsensical approach issues of social preference and that your specific preference does not dictate what reality should be you should put your emotions to the side and do some of your own research because obviously for you the line has been blurred between sexism and feminism your quoting of me highlights exactly what was trying to be communicated by me you you are you you arent the woman that a former coworker who is in a happy relationship asked out at work you are not a universal rule the fact that you can sit here and claim to know an absolute truth about how all people want to be approached is ignorant as fuck i agree with you in that it would be nice if men stopped going around harassing women and being antagonistic when they dont get the response they want but besides that you had absolutely nothing of value to contribute outside of your own personal preference which is not a universal truth
ShitRedditSays,removed,considering its far harder for a white person to get accepted into medicine in south africa than it is for a black personid say hes being reasonablenobody says its oppression its just stupidid much rather have doctors who are going to be smart on average
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a white male you need test scores and standard deviations greater than your peers to get into medicine any other color just requires a pulse its not racist its affirmative action
ShitRedditSays,removed,arent you a pedophile
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats that have to do with it are you grasping at straws to be offended by something
ShitRedditSays,removed,obviously i just meant that someone saying something stupid is enough reason for ridicule not that fighting ignorant fire with ignorant fire is ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,goddamn this has brought out the angry slits
ShitRedditSays,removed,using the word mansplaining completly nullifies your argument for anyone that doesnt already agree with you it is the equivalent of feminazi just wanted you to know
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont see whats funny about that if its a reference to something i dont get it so i probably wouldnt have upvoted it
ShitRedditSays,removed,well honestly i dont see how is this about race yes her name is barb which is closer to black than all or blue but it might just reference the entire trend of those a bit of a sensitive subject to make jokes about sure but not really racist on its own
ShitRedditSays,removed,its just a joke about how unsettling they look i dont know if its a cultural thing or something but you gotta agree that it would be horrormoviecreepy to go to a beach and see everyone wearing those
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is just wrong you know that there is a common stereotype about black kids growing up without a dad and you still joke about the issue how about we all just stop treating it like a joke and redirect our anger towards the guys that do this not every guy or every black guy or white guy
ShitRedditSays,removed,just a quick question from an outsider why are you guys ok with uvorpaleskimo copypasting racist comments onto every post ive seen them get massively upvoted and i cant figure it out
ShitRedditSays,removed,like in real life or on tumblr
ShitRedditSays,removed,did you just assume my gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is such a donald trump thing to say
ShitRedditSays,removed,damn what a brigade you fucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,if i wore short shorts in public i wouldnt be surprised if people started filming i certainly dont have the right to tell them to stop
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know if it needs to go that far does it as a young guy you get hard about everything i once got hard about maple syrup drizzling all over pancakes the teacher did not say anything to her touch himself acknowledge his errction he just sat down behind his desk i would say that is just something that happens but fuck what these people are saying that it is totally okay for the dude to be into her there is a line that should never be crossed i just dont see that line being crossed i know a young teenager that isnt quite sure how penises work and is a little weirded out and a young guy that embarrassingly got a random erection in front of a student would probably just lead to more chaos and confusion if reported however if you do not feel comfortable being alone with him do not if you decide to let this go if there are any signs of him trying to make an advance such as touching you touching himself saying vulgar things showing vulgar things then do not doubt yourself report that random erections happen randomly forcing your thoughts or those erections on a student does not happen without malicious intent
ShitRedditSays,removed,if she didnt tell prospective clients that she used to be male then that is essentially false advertising and rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi your post has been removed submissions must be comments with a score
ShitRedditSays,removed,its also nonlethal when youre dealing with rapists this isnt really a positive
ShitRedditSays,removed,there was nothing transphobic about it a question was asked and it wasnt meant to be malicious was it asked in the most sensitive way possible no but that doesnt mean the person asking is somehow anti trans
ShitRedditSays,removed,it wasnt bigotry just because a person doesnt know all the correct terms or how to ask a question does not mean they are anti trans or a bigot
ShitRedditSays,removed,id love to see you try that
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is filming a public space predatoring on youre an idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,mysogyny how dare you assume that the woman is the victim just because shes female thats a microaggression check your gender privilege you shitlord
ShitRedditSays,removed,pbuf
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be honest saudis are regressive and should be made fun of saudi arabia is a abuser of human rights im for not saying not all muslims but lets be clear that saudi culture hurt peaceful muslims
ShitRedditSays,removed,so your telling me that if someone you wanted asking you out asked you out at some place that isnt specifically designed for trying to get dates youd say no because it wasnt the appropriate place gtfo no place we as humans go is categorically for the sole purpose of meeting mates if you wouldnt say no to someone you want to ask you out because of the location than its not the location thats the issue
ShitRedditSays,removed,yall clearly didnt read the wise words of the mood below this comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats obviously the case this shouldnt have been posted in this subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,blackey whitey both just disgusting words that come from a hateful person i pity you
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean to briefly play devils advocate is marketing not in many ways an extension of patriarchal mores into otherwise selfdetermined areas of our lives i agree this guy takes it way too far but even reading his next comment makes a lot more sense however marketing has zero respect for the customer which is the viewer its all about how they can exploit them any way possible when you lie and deceive and slap people in the face with your marketing phallus the moment they arrive then i have zero tolerance if you have a good enough product you dont have to exploit people you dont have to jack their shit up with malware or spyware like seriously let me edit this however many men have zero respect for women its all about how they can exploit them any way possible when you lie and deceive and use people for sex the moment they give you the chance then i have zero tolerance if youre a genuinely good person you dont have to exploit people i mean shit everyone take another step back even the way cosmetic products and clothing are marketed to women and to men by extension contribute to body issues that are held yes mostly by women no little girl is asking to be fed lies about the way shes supposed to look as she comes of age and yet those lies are forced down her throat the moment she is old enough to watch anything but childrens television or pick up a magazine at the bookstore in a big way this imagery and associated marketing tactics are an affront to her right of selfdetermination they are an unwelcome intrusion into her very personal right to be who she wants to be to think what she wants to think to live according to her desires and not the desires of some old white dudes in a corner office smoking cigars and drinking expensive whiskey fuck i know im getting way off track here this all makes sense to me right now though
ShitRedditSays,removed,the person clarified they dont actually believe this is the right way to view casual sex
ShitRedditSays,removed,yo this is such bullshit dont act like the storm front brigaded subreddits of charlotte represents the city thats incredibly ignorant
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,you poor miserable fool
ShitRedditSays,removed,youve been bad congrats your attempt to creep me out didnt work
ShitRedditSays,removed,the many layers of crazy in this are so much i wish i could believe it was satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,not denying the creepiness of a year old dating a year old but im curious to know what you think if they had stayed together got married and had a healthy marriage keyword healthy today hes and shes
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know how we should handle oppression lets oppress them back s
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow who wouldve guessed you were a redpiller with a name like militanthomofascist
ShitRedditSays,removed,i honestly dont know probably not possible but it doesnt invalidate the statement
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hate futurology as a subreddit it is basically a circle jerk of tech nerds praising stem and how all the professions like doctors lawyers managers or anything that takes serious effort and discipline to graduate and be sucssesful will be replaced by algorithms made by engineers who are borderline autistic and horrible people also not to mention how that sub is plagued by many fake news and bad sources
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit the cult of neckbeard strikes again im surprised he didnt claim feminism and immigration are behind the drop
ShitRedditSays,removed,omg can we just fucking shoot these people
ShitRedditSays,removed,but but but they exposed how soldiers treat shooting people like its a video game how else are these nuts ever going to live out their homicidal fantasies
ShitRedditSays,removed,that cnanana guy is a goy
ShitRedditSays,removed,probably because he is a goy
ShitRedditSays,removed,identifying goys makes it easier to remove them
ShitRedditSays,removed,this comment was about a woman declaring a baby with which she was pregnant to customs it made no mention of the race of the child it did however refer to human seaman as if it was a plant product if that was viewed as being in poor taste i can see that this comment would have been made if the child were white
ShitRedditSays,removed,and just how would one prove this i made the comment thereby being the source you heard it from the source i just wanted to offer some measure of peace to some clearly ruffled self righteous sjws this was not racist judgey for sure but not racist i am sorry to disappoint
ShitRedditSays,removed,here you go break
ShitRedditSays,removed,you are welcome
ShitRedditSays,removed,i referred to a baby conceived in spain and coming into the country as an invasive species you folks in your desperate desire to expose injustice made race a factor
ShitRedditSays,removed,im so unless you oh wise one are in your sixties id hold off on the condescension
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not talking my way around anything i am bored and offering some peace to some people who need some again i would have done the same thing if the young woman had hooked up with a white rando and gotten pregnant its skanky regardless what is racist is implying that no one can make a comment if the baby is brown we all must offer protection because brown people need to be defended and treated differently
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont need help i dont owe anyone an explanation i have the time while i am waiting to talk with some judgmental people who may learn that manufacturing outrage is silly
ShitRedditSays,removed,is it xenophobic to wash my boat at the ramp to prevent zebra mussels from invading also its not xenophobic for customs to ask if you are carrying agricultural products which was the basis of my joke also do you speak for the group
ShitRedditSays,removed,your opinion i have a right to mine censorship is wrong my comment was taken from another sub and brought here also a dude knocking a stranger up on vacation would seem the same to me dont hijack other peoples words to bring to your echo chamber and demand they have no voice you are judging me unfairly please dont ban me that would hurt so much i couldnt bear it
ShitRedditSays,removed,ill stand by it thanks
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are and do
ShitRedditSays,removed,when they dont realize its satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive noticed a lot of people have this skewed idea of an economy being either a capitalist or socialist construct with no middle ground its like the idea that they live in a mixed economy is mindblowing and impossible cant have any of that socialism getting on them i guess
ShitRedditSays,removed,and were not the government bbut srssucks told me that we basically rule reddit and the admins turn a blind eye to us thats sorta like a government for reddit right
ShitRedditSays,removed,a perfect mix of sarcasm and dad joke sounds very patriarchal
ShitRedditSays,removed,you lost me when you dragged cheetos into this snacklivesmatter
ShitRedditSays,removed,the moment you stop thinking about religion race or sex when you are having a conversation with that person when they are not part of the argument then you are progressive
ShitRedditSays,removed,that discriminates assholes you white male scum assholelivesmatter
ShitRedditSays,removed,i literally link to it two comments down
ShitRedditSays,removed,you dont get all satire a wonderful example of political satire is gullivers travels hitchikers guide is also amazing recent satire
ShitRedditSays,removed,dumb frog posters
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope he never finds a job and ends up in prison where he belongs maybe then hell get to experience what he put that poor girl through
ShitRedditSays,removed,i like how you conveniently skipped the previous sentence where he says it also disproportionally targets poor people
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow someone needs mydol a couple of tampons a box of bonbons and a marathon of all my children
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha yea we hate men but hey we also hate sexism
ShitRedditSays,removed,look you idiots obviously dont get that becoming a doctor is hard med school is difficult and getting in is just as hard south africa has affirmative action aimed at groups that were oppressed in past which does not include white men similar to how asians in the us have a harder time getting into college because the standards are stricter for them the same is true for white men in sa is it so wrong for this guy to be proud of his accomplishments is he not allowed to be proud of getting into medical school because hes a white male because if youre arguing that thats such a low point how can you make fun of someone who got into medical school sure his mention of his race may not have been the smartest thing to do or the most relevant thing to his story but you dont belittle someone who got into freaking medical school just because they pointed out that their race and gender doesnt really benefit from affirmative action
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you ever been in a slum before
ShitRedditSays,removed,as i posted elsewhere this is a prejudiced thing to intentionally do good intent or not it is prejudiced now that we have that out of the way reddit can finally admit that literally all writing rooms of decades past are both racist and sexist and that same racism and sexism is part and parcel of why we have so much of it today
ShitRedditSays,removed,this womans behavior was unacceptable regardless
ShitRedditSays,removed,well him being a bigoted ass aside you wouldnt find many who dont think that the quota system hurt sas international performance the system should help in the long term but short term performance will likely suffer
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is from a white south african where whites are systematically excluded from the job market and universities stop being such a naive liberal idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you know whats racist systemically excluding people based on the colour of their skin from the job market universities and anything else government regulated that is racism you pathetic profligate
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is from a white south african where whites are systematically excluded from the job market and universities stop being such a naive liberal idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is from a white south african where whites are systematically excluded from the job market and universities stop being such a naive liberal idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,this whole comment thread is cancer the absolute pinnacle of far left social engineering absolutely pitiful all of you involved in this comment thread take some advice and please please never have kids and spread your sludge of generational failed parenting
ShitRedditSays,removed,blow me
ShitRedditSays,removed,how does absence of censorship continue racism to exist its not like all those racists magically disappear when you forbid them to talk
ShitRedditSays,removed,whoa thats racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,whoa thats sexist
ShitRedditSays,removed,doesnt have the same ring to it youre missing a play on words like op hairheir
ShitRedditSays,removed,you have offended my fat wife
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh this is why comedies are not as good as they used to be too many pcworld filters
ShitRedditSays,removed,come on labeling this guy an abuser is ridiculous he made a dumb joke akin to something bart simpson would say in a prank call i cant believe anyone at all cares about this
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow i didnt realize srs was actually just tumblr
ShitRedditSays,removed,you are correct too many butthurt kids on there that claim everything is raperacistmisogyny
ShitRedditSays,removed,what i dont actually browse this subreddit so i wouldnt know but that cant actually be the common opinion here right that censorship should rule supreme that is i mean the fact that bigots and idiots are allowed to voice their bigoted and idiotic opinions within limits of course is a sign of a healthy democracy if theyre allowed their say sane people are more or less guaranteed theirs also this whole thread seems a bit fucked up i honestly cant tell if this is satire or not some of you are making blanket statements about white people in a thread condemning racism i legitimately dont understand whats the term for saying youre against racism or homophobia or transphobia or misogyny but still do everything you can to help it continue to exist and do nothing to stop it wouldnt education be better than censorship when it comes to ending racism homophobia and transphobia censorship would just breed contempt from homophobesracismtransphobes while education would practically erase it alltogether
ShitRedditSays,removed,its good to see the people on this sub dont like to read context for anything lol a br team got caught cheating then got defended by other br players or more so the br players attacked the other team the guy was saying that brazilians within cs are always attacking anyone who isnt br even if theyre in the right you obviously dont give a shit about context though youre just looking to be offended
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a regular browser of this sub and really hate the passivecasual sexism and the constant posts slandering blm but what mr mungus do to be called an abuser i saw the original clip and he doesnt appear to say anything other than the words hugh mungus a few times
ShitRedditSays,removed,my sisters best friend is gay and he says the f slur all the time i asked him if it bothers his boyfriend or any of their gay friends and he said they all use it he also refers to flamboyant peoplegay or not as fairies it threw me off when i first met him years ago but ive gotten used to it
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt tendies from an ableist copypasta
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you care about the treatment and oppression of disabled people join rcalloutableists
ShitRedditSays,removed,denying privilege is one stupid thing blaming all white people for most of the worlds problems is hilariously idiotic though
ShitRedditSays,removed,meanwhile these people are pissed off that people of color exist in their video games im not sure to what you are referring do you have an example
ShitRedditSays,removed,not as far as i know he hasnt to be honest i think she overreacted here
ShitRedditSays,removed,the post was about the historical accuracy of a video game i saw nobody in that thread being pissed of by the simple fact that there were black people in a game furthermore the use of meanwhile implies that the statement which proceeds it would be happening somewhere else again i ask who are these people that are pissed of that people of color exist in their video games
ShitRedditSays,removed,your ressentiment betrays your weakness friend and allows it to shine
ShitRedditSays,removed,all arguments based on historical accuracy in fiction especially in terms of video games are based in racial purity and nothing else literally all of them eh
ShitRedditSays,removed,your position that literally all eberything racist is laughably dishonest good day
ShitRedditSays,removed,most of the old roasts were non profit as well as comedies that were written before the before most reddit users like you were born
ShitRedditSays,removed,or just not an accurate representation of the conflict
ShitRedditSays,removed,because some percentage of these people have literally said whitestraightcis people are worthless all bad people or should be ashamed of themselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dunno is this srs material its just another play on the fucked your mom joke maybe a little insensitive to the disabled guy but this seems pretty tame
ShitRedditSays,removed,ugh this is why masculine gays fucking suck always the same misogynistic bullshit
ShitRedditSays,removed,so are a shit ton of black people so
ShitRedditSays,removed,racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,what ever helps you sleep better at night second report
ShitRedditSays,removed,where did i say that
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,just kill all males sterilization wont stop them from spreading their bigotry and hate just kill them and the world would be a much safer place
ShitRedditSays,removed,do people in srs actually hate all white males or just the reddit white males honestly sometimes even this place confuses me but still enjoying my visit dont get me wrong there are so many degenerates on reddit who say stuff people in real life wouldnt even think of sometimes i wonder how do these racist bitter and horrible people function in real life
ShitRedditSays,removed,eh im pretty sure racism is different in south africa dont really know much about it though
ShitRedditSays,removed,dats racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow im sure youre fun at parties
ShitRedditSays,removed,how did i end up in an anti white people sub i must be lost ill find the door on my own
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow that cut deep
ShitRedditSays,removed,first off i think the person in question is having an involuntary response to something going on beyond their control just like the girl he talks about yes it is inappropriate to have sexual thoughts about underage children but the op is well aware of that fact and admits to it its not really fair to pigeon hole him like this the situation is so unique
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are correct however theyre not making any judgement about the case at hand theyre simply saying that legally it doesnt matter if an year old consents to sex its still rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont see the huge issue here obviously the statement is accurate a minor can consent but not legally however this is only half the story the adult knows what they are doing is wrong and illegal and they deserve to rot for what they did
ShitRedditSays,removed,minors can consent legally to sex in most countries in canada in france in germany all still technically minors
ShitRedditSays,removed,so youre saying that a child is litteraly incapable of saying yes to sex and that rapists shouldnt be punished for their crimes
ShitRedditSays,removed,you said that my statement a child can say yes to sex but not legally although the adult knows what they are doing is illegal and immoral so they should face the consequences is wrong what exactly is wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you cant legally consent you cant consent til laws of us probably define reality
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was referring to the reasoning legally x is true then x is universally true but yeah of course that fact that i disagree with any point here means its ok to say that im a pedophile rapist and have problematic personality why not you people are so nice
ShitRedditSays,removed,original my ass
ShitRedditSays,removed,defending other countrys lower age of consent the question about the age of consent didnt even cross my mind when i typed my comment no shit other countries have lower age of consent i have no idea about this age in any country and i am not really concerned about it i used the remark about us to emphasize an absurdity of the idea that laws determine objective reality and legal terms should be considered as a source of semantics
ShitRedditSays,removed,other countries have lower age of consent that doesnt mean that a year old in european country is able to consent to an adult due to the power imbalance lol am i missing something or this is exactly an example of what i initially said legal consent cannot define what we consider consent i suppose you will conclude now that youre rapist pedophile with terrible personality
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry i dont really understand what you mean
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair its genetics its ingrained in male humans to be sexually atracted to females that has undergone puberty that we in todays society label as children if you like pre pubesant year olds there is something wrong with you though
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean the birth mother who allows her yearold to masturbate wherever she feels like
ShitRedditSays,removed,ew trans liberals are scum fuck your fitting in bullshit ill be fabulous and gender non conforming as i always been
ShitRedditSays,removed,pedosayswhat
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you sure cause im and my girlfriend is turning at the end of this month are you saying she shouldnt be able to legally consent whatsoever even though weve been together since i was and she was
ShitRedditSays,removed,policemen risk their lives to protect us
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is mansplaining in srss own words
ShitRedditSays,removed,id question the wisdom of asking him to google it by their own admission googling did the holocaust happen brings up stormfront as the first result
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a negress they have more testosterone than asian males hence the deep voice and the inches clitoris rodditcom
ShitRedditSays,removed,already did
ShitRedditSays,removed,i got a job instead
ShitRedditSays,removed,rthathappened
ShitRedditSays,removed,also not like it stops anyone from drawing lesbian smut anyway
ShitRedditSays,removed,being white never really helped me in toronto where every race is a minority and all that matters is your bank account being white never helped people in ireland who have dealt with classoppression for ages im really annoyed at the insistence of using skincolor in your arguments its really narrowly focusing on a small part of a bigger picture maybe you should leave your little american bubble and see the rest of the world you might be surprised how unoppressive it can be you know what fuck it go wage your race war see where that goess
ShitRedditSays,removed,even if youre a child rapist or whatever your punishments should be addressing why you did it and prevent you from doing it again rather than throwing you into a cell and calling you filth to be forgotten i feel like there has to be enough of a punishment for it to be an effective deterrent
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not a rapist but id defend a person charged with rape until the moment they were convicted presumption of innocence yo
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not conservatism its antisocialism
ShitRedditSays,removed,i looked on my mirror just yesterday and was horrified to find a fly crawling on it so i quickly squashed it before it escaped and joined the hidden swarm of flies that has taken up residence in my room which is actually fairly clean so i have no idea why there are so many flies and it really irritates and upsets me because if i dont kill them then they will likely reproduce and then their offspring becomes part of the swarm in a never ending cycle unless i can stop them but they are so good at hiding that i can never quite catch them all
ShitRedditSays,removed,what does that have to do with anything though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think only some autistic would make fun of someone autistic like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,feel free to talk about anything you like except if our moderators dont agree with it in which case we will ban you question are you guys interested in discussions or is this a place where you just reverberate the same ideologies that the mods share
ShitRedditSays,removed,its less active because the overlysensitve mods are insulating themselves from reasonable and even sensible nonhateful discussions if you so much as critisize anything they say you get banned try to complain muted this is just as bad as rthedonald now
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope people realize i only said that to flip the roles and highlight how sexist and condescending mansplaining and manspreading are genderverb words are stupid and incredibly hypocritical
ShitRedditSays,removed,k as long as you guys are making fun of it out of ignorance and not misinformation i dont und
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay how about this this message is for all the women out there who lie about being raped for revenge or power just stop this is not directed at all women just women who make things harder than they already are stop lying about rape women or this one this message is to all the black men out there who arent there for their kids just stop be a parent stop being a coward and running from your problems stop perpetuating poverty among poc stop the stereotype we know there are good black fathers out there but this message isnt for them stop abandoning your kids black men you offended
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah what a bunch of dicks
ShitRedditSays,removed,we should all tell ubuttlusting some truth ill start bl everyone who has ever loved you was wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,you wanted to know why white guys were offended i explained very clearly why they could be offended whether or not you agree with the content of my comparisons is irrelevant theyre an explanation as to why personally as you may have guessed i dont support victim culture the content of the character of a person is what is most important i think that the video you referenced was incredibly racist and demeaning about as demeaning as a poster telling men not to rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,this isnt very funny to those of us who have been assaulted as part of gang initiations
ShitRedditSays,removed,the trump dump is now pages
ShitRedditSays,removed,lame
ShitRedditSays,removed,dicks out for harambe
ShitRedditSays,removed,totally one time an sjw set my house on fire with their attack helicopter
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree but this comment wasnt transphobic crass maybe but the heart of this comment is basically do people know that you are trans as opposed to non trans prior to sex not wanting to sleep with a trans person is not transphobic anymore than my not wanting to sleep with a man is homophobic
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i dont think you have favorable enough ratios of black and white people anywhere other than the west
ShitRedditSays,removed,you guys are adorable its hilarious how selfrighteous you are
ShitRedditSays,removed,i like to think heshe gets irrationally angry when he sees a chick in long pants
ShitRedditSays,removed,hmm i think this is probably mistake and he means trans woman
ShitRedditSays,removed,you tag yourself as manservant of the glorious fempire you are the bigot here
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean are they wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,perhaps in the dictionary but not in conversation
ShitRedditSays,removed,being vegan isnt a choice
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey cheer up it could be worse you could be the proud owner of a pontiac aztek
ShitRedditSays,removed,as in the style in which you live your life not hard to understand why that term is used because its correct
ShitRedditSays,removed,the difference is that you dont see men being defended its quite in vogue to bash men
ShitRedditSays,removed,reeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh i read who act on their impulse forget i said anything i though the guy seeing it as a sexual orientation
ShitRedditSays,removed,get mercy pregnant at utc pghy replied to guys im shaking im fucking shaking i never wanted to breed with anyone more than i want to with halloween mercy that perfect curvy body those bountiful breasts the child bearing hips of a literal goddess it honestly fucking hurts knowing that ill never mate with her pass my genes through her and have her birth a set of perfect offspring id do fucking anything for the chance to get halloween mercy pregnant a n y t h i n g and the fact that i cant is quite honestly too much to fucking bear why would blizzard create something so perfect to fucking tantalize us fucking laugh in our faces honestly guys i just fucking cant anymore fuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,i gotta say that i would not want my reddit posts to be attributed to the real me
ShitRedditSays,removed,that reply is taken out of context he agreed that george z was a piece of shit who acted within his rights which we now know stand your ground is fucking insaneand protects shitbirds i feel bad for him so many people viewing this regular guy under this microscope
ShitRedditSays,removed,saying that this is justification to murder someone is way over the line a better way to have put would be that she is definitely setting herself up for very negative reactions you gotta think that the guys she dates have right to some disclosure before hand and to spring it on them at an intimate moment or after the fact definitely gives her date the right to be upset there are people that are uncomfortable with trans people they have rights too
ShitRedditSays,removed,if youre a pedophile do your deed within the law find a person of the age of consent who looks young heshe is but looks youll get weird looks but fuck em i believe the podcast biggest problem in the universe went into this moderately well about nonoffending pedophiles and how they feel attacked for something they cant control find a partner an do baby cosplay swaddle idk what you need just check ids if need be find a hooker who looks hyper young be constructive hentai ive accidently stumbled across some kiddie hentai that was weird but im sure nonoffenders would enjoy
ShitRedditSays,removed,i can relate its one of many reasons i wish i had given in to my urges to give my grandfathers old shotgun a blowjob is there any problem suicide cant solve
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not true he said the shooting was legally justified not morally justified given floridas stand your ground law thats true its really disturbing seeing how the media and general public have been so quick to demonize this guy with lies and exaggerations
ShitRedditSays,removed,umyfaceisitchy dont tell anyone but im a white supremacist posts it on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,whys he a creep though in another thread somebody explained his justified re trayvon martin comment didnt he explain he meant legally justified and went on to call george zimmerman a shitbag
ShitRedditSays,removed,are all middle aged cis dudes creeps
ShitRedditSays,removed,for context

ShitRedditSays,removed,if enough people in new zealand kills themselves the demand for cheese would drop and one would assume the price would drop too
ShitRedditSays,removed,just out of curiosity what do you guys find funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,our policy is and remains that doxxing making threats brigading and other harassing behavior is absolutely unacceptable if you do it myself or any of the other mods will happily ban you because frankly it isnt worth it to keep you around not to mention that most of us have been targets of that kind of harassment ourselves it sucks i dont wish it on anyone dat feeling when but for your intervention most of your subs fans and contributors would behave exactly like the people youve been trying to take the piss out of this whole time
ShitRedditSays,removed,i asked first
ShitRedditSays,removed,and if you mean harassing people or brigading avoiding that isnt hard either i dont want to be uncharitable so ill take you at your word but note that a lot of people vary their definition of harassment when it applies to something theyre doing to someone they dont like vs when something is being done to them by someone they dont like what might be your definition of harassment btw
ShitRedditSays,removed,i lold too hard
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you completely missed their point
ShitRedditSays,removed,seriously the person said they dont think its wrong to protest as long as you arent targeting people because of their race youre defending people that are literally targeting people for their race what makes it ok just because theyre white thats a really good way to taint your image and i know im gonna get banned for saying this but this sub is terrible you guys cant seem to understand that some things are jokes yet when that vorpaleskimo person says to exterminate whites or something equivalent yall hide behind saying oh its just a joke unless youre implying that youre serious about that in which case thats even worse this sub is a toxic echo chamber and banning me will just prove that but go ahead and keep up the hypocrisy at least i wont have to look at post by people with no logic anymore
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt so much butthurt over an opinion
ShitRedditSays,removed,why do i even bother
ShitRedditSays,removed,if youre in a relationship and the person hits you it can be your fault though right i mean if theyre a good person and youre a crazy nut job with huge issues and mental health problems you can push them over the edge right this is a genuine question i am asking for a friend im using a throwaway so people dont know ive asked

ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought that thread was incredibly tame to be honest the internet probably isnt a safe place for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,wellactually sometimes it does like in the first mass shooting approximately minutes after first shooting from the observation deck whitman began to encounter return fire from both the police and armed civilians one texas ranger used a student as spotter to help locate the sniper at this point whitman chose to fire through waterspouts located on each side of the tower walls this action largely protected him from gunfire below but limited his range of targets police sharpshooter marion lee reported from a small airplane that he had observed a single sniper firing from the observation deck lee tried to shoot whitman from the plane but the turbulence proved too great whitman shot at the plane and it moved off to circle from a greater distance whitman never shot any of his victims more than once after they had fallen to the ground it is believed that whitman kept in his mind the us marine corps tradition of one shot one kill of warfare training three officers who responded to reports of the sniper were ramiro martinez accompanied by civilian allen crum houston mccoy and jerry day prior to advancing upon the tower mccoy had seen his colleague billy speed killed both martinez and day had driven to the university of texas after listening to radio reports accompanied by civilian allen crum—whom the trio encountered as they ran toward the tower—they were the first to reach the towers observation deck after reaching the floor by elevator they encountered m j gabour gabour—clutching his wifes shoes— screamed that his family had been shot and tried to wrestle the rifle from day to shoot whitman himself day consoled gabour and led him to safety before joining mccoy crum and martinez as they walked up to the floor beneath the stairwell leading to the reception area officer martinez saw the body of a teenaged boy mark gabour next to him lay a middleaged woman marguerite lamport nearby mike gabour lay slumped against the wall with his mother lying face down in a pool of blood the officers turned mary gabour onto her side to prevent her from drowning in her own blood mike gabour gestured to the observation deck and said hes out there stepping outside the south door around pm martinez closely followed by mccoy proceeded north on the east deck while day followed by crum proceeded west on the south deck with the intention of encircling whitman several feet before he reached the southwest corner crum accidentally discharged the borrowed rifle alerting whitman that he wasnt alone on the observation deck whitman was apparently initially unaware of martinez and mccoy on the observation deck he was partially shielded by the deck tower lights and in a position to defend against assaults from either corner but his attention was drawn to where crum had accidentally discharged his rifle as whitman sat crouched with his back positioned on the north wall and looking in the northwest corner area of the observation deck where crums shot was heard martinez jumped around the corner into the northeast area and rapidly fired all six rounds from his police revolver from a distance of roughly feet m at whitman—all of which missed as martinez fired mccoy jumped to the right of martinez and fired two fatal shots of with his shotgun hitting whitman in the head neck and left side martinez threw down his nowempty revolver and grabbed mccoys shotgun running to whitmans supine body and firing point blank into his upper left arm martinez threw the shotgun onto the deck and hurriedly left the scene repeatedly shouting the words i got him after tending to the wounded in the stairwell austin police department apd officers milton shoquist harold moe and george shepard ascended the stairs to join apd officer phillip conner and texas department of public safety agent wa cowan arriving on the floor moe heard martinez as he ran past shouting i got him and relayed his words to the apd radio dispatchers handheld radio martinez later credited the numerous civilian shooters for saving many lives by forcing whitman to take cover limiting his range of targets httpsenwikipediaorgwikicharleswhitman
ShitRedditSays,removed,the problem of unrealistic expectations seems to be facing both genders the commenter doesnt discount that but rather highlights chinese womens greater culpability in the situation his implied suggestion that women should lower their standards makes sense given that the women have greater control over their standards than the men do on their social status of course thats assumes chinese women want to be married they might be happier being single and picky
ShitRedditSays,removed,call it whatever you like the reality is is that chinese women have a great deal of control over who they choose to marry if they consider being single a problem then the answer is simple change your expectations this is assuming chinese women want to be married which may not be the case maybe they prefer to be single and picky
ShitRedditSays,removed,feel free to point out where i made the assumption that chinese women are materialistic and shallow i suspect you cant why do you think being picky means there is something wrong with your personality normally youd be right on your point except that china is pretty different as there are more males than females thanks to one child policy and parental preference for males additionally chinese men are expected to be wealthy in order to be an elligble spouse while chinese women are not in a era where chinese unemployment is extremely high for the young this puts males at a comparative disadvantage so no men dont have the power in dating in china
ShitRedditSays,removed,things like this are what accentuate rape culture and cause men to constantly rape women so women stop making rape jokes all the time this makes men rape women
ShitRedditSays,removed,most people make jokes about war though its not just what reddit says if anything getting all shocked and outraged by that right here is what reddit says for others to make fun of dont ever make comedy sketches about war not funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,knowing theyll never be able to have kids regardless of their ability crushed them and destroyed their spirit so theyd rather have a disabled child than no child at all and that crushed their spirit which is more important than the child living with a disability their whole life what a great argument against eugenics
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a dank meme subreddit its just for comedy nobody cares xd
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah because she is the boss and there are ways of overasserting your authoritah as a boss that are actually douchey and counterproductive that point in the comment flew right over your head didnt it
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean they act like almost every male boss is encouraged to act no theyre not often theyre encouraged to act reasonably also this is textbook mansplaining some very very good management advice with a paragraph of shitty blatant misogyny buried within there is no misogyny in this quote that of course the op is above because penis you people talk too much about penises
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank god because without that context theres nothing wrong with the quote if you thought there was and the context merely make it worse youre a plonker but most people on this sub appear to be
ShitRedditSays,removed,fuck christ lol but cant we all just get along no we dont hence vetting and borders and lol at the the worlds a mean place so ban the mulsims at the end vetting and borders to this guy is ban the mulslims op is an idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,of course you think the exact other way around so youre contradicting yourself just the same d
ShitRedditSays,removed,my point is that i think these guys actually think a woman screaming during sex is totally normal and natural sheys a screamer tha one if they cant hear her they wont hear os you people are dumb
ShitRedditSays,removed,the reason this is less likely to happen to america than to europe is precisely because theyre inoculated against letting that happen
ShitRedditSays,removed,because white men dominate the usa through dishonest means they are incredibly insecure and fear even the smallest minority as capable of seizing power from them you dont want islamic minorities to grow into majorities and seize power from bad white men either trust me
ShitRedditSays,removed,muslim americans are just as american as the next guy theyre loyal members of all branches of the military doctors politicians teachers you name it a percentage is at least
ShitRedditSays,removed,our government is currently in the hands of nationalistic reactionaries who push blame onto minorities yeah but only since recently and it couldve easily turned out differently
ShitRedditSays,removed,the difference is that christian assholes typically are regarded as such independent of their religion while muslims are not the much lower percentage of violent vocal assholes and tyrannical regimes is another difference
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont have to have compassion for refugees because theyre br i mean because their religion is eeevil since theyre exactly as peaceful and enlightened as the westerners br remains as the only plausible reason for that sentiment
ShitRedditSays,removed,ratheism is protrump now it was ardently antitrump not a few weeks ago either youre way off or they did a too lazy to click and find out right now tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,is pretty prosocial justice theyre not so much pro social justice as sjws as in irrational zealots who think theyre fighting for social justice misogynistic asshole atheists like thunderfoot the claim that thunderfoot is misogynistic or whatever is a myth perpetrated by sj zealots like rationalwiki and others apparently this sub is also irrational in that way
ShitRedditSays,removed,potentially harmful things religions can cause like laws based on religion violating the rights of those who dont follow that religion potentially harmful

ShitRedditSays,removed,was a straight out nazi who has taken a vow to destroy the republic thats exactly what trump is he said how he hated all thebrown people in his speech and vowed to destroy the republic
ShitRedditSays,removed,people got fed up with your bigoted bullshit and dont want to waste any more time with an awful person like you its not complicated unless that persons bigotry happens to be a fantasy in your brain and your refusal to listen results in you not correcting this fantasy then weve got a problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,seems a lot more like hes criticizing the emerging genre than anything hes lamenting that the cast is wasted on a more than likely subpar remake
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not that easy fucking morons
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be fair he didnt say they were useless just breakable
ShitRedditSays,removed,i suffer from multiple congenital defects and related illnesses because my parents deliberately conceived me despite understanding the risks im and i am rapidly converging on the most optimistic of my doctors life expectancy forecasts i live in immense pain every day and dont really have a shred of dignity left given how reliant i am on others to do the most basic of things for me i can only ruefully dream that my parents had been selfless enough to practice eugenics this whole thread should be self referenced back into srs you people make me sick
ShitRedditSays,removed,this better not be some woeful trump has oppressed me bullshit you sjws are a an extremely obnoxious bunch i can bet thats exactly what it is whatever its your own personal choice nobody can force you one way or the other
ShitRedditSays,removed,these are the people who couldnt be bothered with actually voting against trump no wonder so many life long progressives are livid with sanders for this electoral cycle

ShitRedditSays,removed,did you even read the thread
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly this thread is just idiotic
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think it can just be a bit depressing to look through a long list of scholarships that dont apply to you now if one looks at the details its clear the scholarships arent huge amounts of money i mostly qualified for scholarships based on merit but the amounts were worth more but for a white male student who achieved less than i did in school i imagine it can be a bit disheartening not saying they are right i just think its easy to see the emotion behind it
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you not understand sarcasm
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is sad honestly
ShitRedditSays,removed,the guy was actually joking the thread talks about an mma fighter beating his wife for bringing home the wrong noodles yeah its dark and exaggerated but the guys making light of the fact that someone would be physical over something as small and stupid as the wrong noodles everyone needs to chill the fuck out it was a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,id punch her hard af

ShitRedditSays,removed,its just an advertising trick sex sells women are subconsciously attractive to phallic objects thus why cigarette sales are so high and men well are attracted to sexy women thus the sale of even more cigarettes maybe turn off the tv and drown out the noise with your own creativity so that you arent subjected subconsciously to these influences of western society and whatever that is they are telling these women be youre own woman sheesh

ShitRedditSays,removed,lol as a really young kid i remember thinking of the vagina as a giant clammy slit in that area kind of like a front butt and you stick your peepee in there before you go to sleep
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank you ever so much may i lick on your trans balls some more as you as i accept your correcting me
ShitRedditSays,removed,okay jesus im normally on this subs side but this is literally just dark humor i dont think the joke is very funny but its pretty ridiculous to imply that people somehow cant make jokes about httpsenwikipediaorgwikigallowshumor dont most people here love rmeirl you know the sub that normalizes depression and suicidal thoughts
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope he gets spencered
ShitRedditSays,removed,white men are literally nazis all white men no exceptions in fact if i ever become pregnant with a boy ill get an abortion on principal fuck them

ShitRedditSays,removed,thats creepy
ShitRedditSays,removed,who the hell is ben

ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you not see the irony in that you have biased favouritism towards a minority group
ShitRedditSays,removed,first of all women safely say no several million times a day secondly anyone can have a weapon a knife or gun is just as dangerous no matter whose hands it is in thirdly none of any of this changes the fact that a woman can and do get more sex than men it just so happens that twice as many human females have sex as do males its not even a question up for debate its objective demonstrable truth and fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,they arent
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is it racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,what although that storys probably fake or modified if a girl lies about her age in a bar you cant blame the guy for raping lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,would you be willing to look at statistics at all issues including this one and black violence
ShitRedditSays,removed,has anyone seen the new video on rvideos titled being fat is not okdeal with it in which an overweight man is essentially giving the pass to shame heavy people for their habits and their health i saw it yesterday and expected it to show up here its like reddits wet dream a fat guy said it was ok therefore all fat people must benefit from bullying im doing them a service by shaming them the kind of thinking that this guy is promoting is really one dimensional while he may be lucky enough to have complete agency over his diet and eating habits and can himself benefit from being shamed for his weight he doesnt at all consider the fact that weight is often an outward manifestation of physical or psychological issues it saddens me that those who rely on food or their relationship to food as a mental crutch can easily be identified and targeted and shamed based on their physical appearance ive been on many phases of the eating disorder spectrum from binge eating to bulimia and now to heavy restriction im at my thinnest but i hate my body more than i ever have in my life im nutritionally and physically the unhealthiest ive ever been in my lifebut i get so much more reinforcement and compliments for my behaviors than i did when i was heavy even though my heaviest and smallest weights both have been unhealthy physical manifestations of deepseated emotional problems people deserve to be treated with kindness and while their physical health is important and an important issue to consider mental health cant go unchecked i hate the mentality that redditors have in thinking that bullying an overweight individual is for their own good for their healthwhen ive seen redditors on other subs call anorexic behaviors hot and attractive you dont care about their health if you did you would nurture people mentally as well as physically i envy people who have such healthy relationships with food that they cant even imagine that simple actions like eat more or eat less arent really that simple for many people regardless of body type the aforementioned video didnt really even consider eating disorders as attributing to cyclic and inescapable patterns in behavior around food the person in the video only offers something to the tune of people who blame their weight on depression emotional issues childhood issuespeople of all sizes have to deal with those issues too my brd babies how that statement got my blood boilingthe way an individual chooses to cope with those issues is dramatically different from person to person food is a drug food is a crutch food is how you can self harm food is how you can reward yourself it would be so harmful to tell someone struggling with drug addiction addicted because you want to escape your feelings about lack of control and self worth everyone deals with those issues just stop taking mdma simplebut because we equate being overweight with a lack of self control apparently our relationship to food is more of a conscious choice gain some perspective i really truly hope this guy can get healthy and lose weight everyone deserves to love themselves while also appreciating their body by physically allowing it to do all the amazing things it can do but why does he have to call for every overweight person to get healthy with him in this moment in the same way what if theyre not ready what if they dont need the same type of motivation as you do why cant we just be more nurturing rant over guys i love you babes when your body is hungry its calling to be nourished feed it love it no one deserves to come home and hate any part of themselves your body does not determine your self worth dont let anyone tell you how to dress your body dont even dress to your bodydress to your soul
ShitRedditSays,removed,modern feminism is hurting women by making them out to be victims im certainly not sheltered i spent years working for the rape crisis center getting fed this same rhetoric of rape culture and boohoo society is mean it certainly makes you feel social and smarter than those around you of course but it isnt a realistic world view and it doesnt solve any real problems the world isnt going to decide one day to be nice women will never be safe no one will you dont get a safe space this is the world we have man you learn to start with the world the way it is not some fantasy land where we just tell rapists not to rape that doesnt work
ShitRedditSays,removed,killcispeople
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre proving my point right now haha have a nice day
ShitRedditSays,removed,bitch cunt
ShitRedditSays,removed,just a test niggers
ShitRedditSays,removed,what was wrong with normal gendered
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow it is really bad no one is complaining about these hurtful words as it could offend someone
ShitRedditSays,removed,so tired of this transphobe shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,umm excuse me but i am stinkgender and using nonsmelly words in your post is fucking cisnormative and oppressive to my stenchkin i expect anyone who replies to my comment to write sniff dang you stank before their post or else i will be triggered and retreat to me fartspace
ShitRedditSays,removed,source on those two people complaining about male rape
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know its really sad that all us srs people are harassing everyone on the internet im glad there are million posts on this sub to remind us all about how horrible harassment is sigh
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh no someone said nigger this word has become such a fuckin meme ive literally never seen a black person irl or on the internet get upset over this word its an entirely white thing to think this word is harmful at utc rakeni replied to man who cares oh no someone said nigger this word has become such a fuckin meme ive literally never seen a black person irl or on the internet get upset over this word its an entirely white thing to think this word is harmful i find it really fucking odd that the same people who pop the breaks and go into meltdown at the sound of nigger are the same people who shout triggered when a feminist is upset at something equally as meaningless like calling a woman love
ShitRedditSays,removed,am i like the only hispanic trans women who finds this perfectly fine and a bit funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,a lot of people say im fine even when theyre not and expect you to press them a little bit to show you care
ShitRedditSays,removed,itt a bunch of
ShitRedditSays,removed,look at the edit in the post
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean hes right though albinos are a minority among gorillas it would take a national outrage for people to become aware seeing as black gorillas are roughly the equivalent of white people
ShitRedditSays,removed,lesbians arent allowed to appreciate it
ShitRedditSays,removed,im referencing what ive seen multiple times just glancing around the sub yesterday where someone talks about white cis males getting a laugh out of minorities i was wondering if with all these people talking about cis white males that liking the humor would somehow lessen my standing among other feminists
ShitRedditSays,removed,we stop when theyre dead contrary to popular belief theyre alive and kicking
ShitRedditSays,removed,wat the nazis were open biological essentialists why would they try to make their antisemitism more palatable their antisemitism
ShitRedditSays,removed,for a second i thought this was a rsubredditsimulator post
ShitRedditSays,removed,i means its not that bad their dead and hot best make use of them somehow
ShitRedditSays,removed,kek
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think its a crime but tricking people into having sex with you isnt a good thing ideally you should be honest about your history its not something everyone is comfortable with and i personally think that if you really care about someone youd make sure theyre comfortable with you before you have sex with them
ShitRedditSays,removed,the examples to hiv are bad butbuti think theyre generally right speaking strictly from an american perspective the model penal code since every state has fuck all to do with each and no two are alike the mpc is the best approximation we can hope for global consent provisions declared deception of almost any kind renders the victims consent legally ineffective the farthest state that has gone down this path is california and its yes means yes law they havent gone as far as what the mpc outlined california still distinguishes between some types of fraud for example the reason why such a bold position got into the mpc a creation of consensusseeking academics and lawyers is because both defense minded and prosecutorial minded activists could get behind the changes itd entail for one statutory rape cases where the minor induces the older sexual partner with false statements about the minors age would in fact be the rapist instead of the older person californias legislation still has statutory tape on the books so yes means yes evidently isnt purely about consent in those cases it isnt even a primary consideration but its all the same legal principle that is quite old in terms of common law it also is probably inevitable looking historically at the changes the mpc has brought about and continues to bring about that more states will provide their courts with a more searching standard for consentlets call it informed consentlite aids status age whether youre a hollywood actor gender history medical history theres been some interesting consortium cases with ball snipping and paternity payments already are all going the same way in the eyes of the law and i think thats a good thing if someones consent is predicated on knowing some fact no matter how bizarre then if big if practically speaking we want consent to be important then we have to treat all nonconsent equally valid
ShitRedditSays,removed,well if what youre implying was true any company perhaps one with a female ceo that was willing to be rational and hire all these fantastic underemployed women at the wages they were actually worth would have a huge competitive advantage would they not they would have the pick of talent from of the population that other companies were irrationally uninterested in due to their internalized misogyny
ShitRedditSays,removed,strange argument immigrants dont have to conform to their societies customs because at a point in history colonialism happened does this only apply to white countries or am i allowed to flaunt the customs of turkey because it once formed the base of the ottoman empire does an african migrant to saudi arabia get to disregard its customs because it was once the heart of the transsaharan slave trade considering that western countries have the best record in the world for womens rights and lgbt rights isnt it a good thing if immigrants from third world nations where the are lessno protections for womenlgbt people adopt the values of their new nations
ShitRedditSays,removed,unless the trans person is explicitly asked whether or not theyre trans and they lie deception has nothing to do with this speaking just in terms of how the mpc and california treat deception i havent read this proposed statute but im guessing its the same deception here can be by omission just as much as by an express act to take a dramatic example if you load a gun and then omit to place it in a safe spot and someone gets hurt theres a strong prima facie case for criminal liability or perhaps though i am loath to use it omitting hiv status or going further back in common law marriage status omission really is a matter of degree at most and under these new statutes a matter of very incremental degreeslike whether you get an easier sentence
ShitRedditSays,removed,are a lot of white women forced to cover their face in public
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you seriously suggesting that the abuse of children in the first world is worse than the abuse of children in africatme have you not heard of bacha bazi
ShitRedditSays,removed,could you clarify please do you a believe that the genders are equal and only cultural factors matter or b believe that genders are distinct and can be better at certain things that are not just physical eg schoolwork as you implied here and if the genders are distinct what is it that causes girls to score better on exams a higher iq or just a better innate work ethic
ShitRedditSays,removed,could they then claim that they would never have given consent had they known that and then have me charged one thing to remember is that old courtroom quip that a criminal trial is about proof not truthno matter what the law says i imagine that sort of scenario would be very difficult to prove to any judge or jury no matter how sympathetic but pulling back my answer is simply another question is consent the most important well lets call it element of rape i think under the mpc and we lived in this ideal world where someone would feel violated and is able to prove that you lying about yourself caused them to consent to have sex with you and you knewshould have known your lying about it was what got them to say yes then yesagain assuming consent is the most important factor here it doesnt really matter why someone is telling you no or would tell you know
ShitRedditSays,removed,but women outperforming men at academics is a trend that has been continuing for close to years now actually if youve been paying attention you shouldnt be surprised that more women are going to university than men they did so last year and the year before if i might ask how do you explain this while of course completely dismissing the idea that a the academic system could be biased towards woman and b that there are innate gender differences and lets say hypothetically it were the case that the academic system was biased in favor of women would that be a cause for people men or women to be upset
ShitRedditSays,removed,so why dont companies that hire women do much better if you save in salaries you will have a huge competitive advantage over everyone else
ShitRedditSays,removed,i posted this but it must have been removed by accident i messaged the mods and got no reply as it is breaking no rules
ShitRedditSays,removed,surprised you found time to take a break from trembling and pissing your pants to post that
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,cisgenderism is a mental illness tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,completely ridiculous rape fantasy is beyond normal it cant even be considered a fetish because it is so popular fucking die omg
ShitRedditSays,removed,well please tell me how it works
ShitRedditSays,removed,you pc brah
ShitRedditSays,removed,well for example or companies with men
ShitRedditSays,removed,it wasnt an actual request for death if that makes you feel better
ShitRedditSays,removed,sleeping with the admins taken to a whole new level
ShitRedditSays,removed,rape porn is different than rape so no
ShitRedditSays,removed,it wont change much basically all white males have the urge to rape people some black people do as well but not as many im a feminist so i know this for a fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,rape porn is actually one of the most watched categories for women way higher than it is for men but good job sounding like an ignorant fool
ShitRedditSays,removed,also if anybody knows any good spike and starlight glimmer romance no clop fics please let me know tyvm
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is no difference most women fantasize about getting raped thy just like being put in their place but this sub is the biggest goldmine on reddit the idiots here are always good for a laugh
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha are you triggered cuck
ShitRedditSays,removed,nothing like juicy sjw cuck tears this sub truly is a gold mine
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats called islamic advocacy
ShitRedditSays,removed,can you cite any of these studies
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh man i think we should start banning movies that have murder too what a bunch of crap
ShitRedditSays,removed,shaming tactics who wouldve guessed
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think people are blowing this out of proportion telling someone they are transphobic because they dont want to have sex with a trans person is like saying someone is homophobic because they dont want to have sex with someone of the same gender im dont mind trans people and i even have a few trans friends but i shouldnt be classified as a bigot simply because i wouldnt date one it is just my preference not my ideologies
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi harry
ShitRedditSays,removed,httprosbenzrfcom
ShitRedditSays,removed,he was a convicted felon and according to the cops was brandishing which is illegal even in open carry states
ShitRedditSays,removed,they shouted drop the gun an awfully long time before planting the gun with magicians speed
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,i find it funny how you guys think you know what his grandma was like just because she was a holocaust survivor assuming that its true anyway this sub is a joke of its own
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats the thing though exactly when does something stop beckming a joke or funny should all non serious things just be considered a joke people laugh at death hell most things on tv that consist of making you laughing have people get hurt or killed unless death is not funny to you granted you could all view this as non funny too and thats freat for you but like i say people have different things to laugh at youd be surprised by how many people find the joke funny if by the number of upvotes ahh well i dont particularly find it funny either but certainly not something to get upset about
ShitRedditSays,removed,i asked a question about this once but more to the point of being educated in a poor black community is severely discourage and they make fun of you for being too white the consensus even by other black posters was that this is entirely true of course i dont pretend that this is every problem in poor black communities and there is a fuck ton of systematic racism that im starting to open my eyes and see as a middle class white male but to say that there arent things their own communities can work towards is disingenuous
ShitRedditSays,removed,sjws keep wanting to expand the definition of rape so that any sexual encounter could be considered rape the story says he coerced her into giving him oral sex what the fuck are women today so fucking weak that they cant say no and when they cant say no its rape this is todays rape culture claiming every sexual encounter is rape and its a shame too because more and more actual rapes are being ignored because the word has lost all meaning there was a story not too long ago about a girl that told a guy were not having sex tonight he starts to make out with her and i guess in her warped mind she didnt want to become a rape victim so she enthusiastically had sex with him then wondered of shed been raped great so as a man enthusiastic consent is not even enough anymore i could still be raping sometime who is screaming oh god yes i love it keep fucking me
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats good to know and i can only form my opinion as worthless as my opinion really is based on what other people tell me ive never been black never lived in a poor black community and really have no idea what its like and im not shifting anything i just admitted that i was part of the problem i had my narrative all figured out in my mind but blm has caused me to re think all my previous ideas systematic racism is a real thing unfortunately as a white male im not really welcome in blm circles so i do what i can to help educate my other white friends with similar misconceptions
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah because segregation wasnt slavery and therefore blacks have had like what years of full support from whites to better themselves what the fuck is wrong with them s
ShitRedditSays,removed,its shitty ask science you cant take that seriously
ShitRedditSays,removed,white guy so he probably did something to deserve it i wonder what the dog was wearing
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow projecting much
ShitRedditSays,removed,do black lives not matter when another black person takes them does the same go for white people asians every fucking color inbetween what im trying to say is glass this entire planet
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait so youre saying that someone born as a female choosing to be a man doesnt have a female brain
ShitRedditSays,removed,l o l b e n n e d
ShitRedditSays,removed,by your own logic why is it that every white person is supposed to be responsible for the actions of every other white person do you realize how hypocritical what you just said is
ShitRedditSays,removed,nice got him with the technicality
ShitRedditSays,removed,so lets talk about it then
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure that they meant trans female op was probably muddled up with terms dont hate lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,let the triggering begin
ShitRedditSays,removed,calling someone a transphobe isnt an argument just fyi
ShitRedditSays,removed,thank god no one wanted you there lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,redditors are trash redditor
ShitRedditSays,removed,looool deluded
ShitRedditSays,removed,god damn you need tongo outside i mean i havent felt the need to call someone a tattle tale or teachers pet in decades but you apache helicopter you take the cake
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus christ are you really completely oblivious to how racist you are can i ask you a serious question and maybe i can better understand are you white disabled trans i just cant for thr life of me see how you can be so blinded by your own racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol see and i actually chuckled it makes me feel good you weird folks are stuck behind your computer screens and your thoughts and ideas will stay there honest to god though i am all for trans people being happy and equal gay people muslims everyone should have that right the lead singer of my favourite band came out as transgendered mtf a year or two ago and it really opened my eyes to this whole world and the more and more i looked into it the more i learned i wasnt welcome in fact i was hated the singer herself got shit on by your community because she was a tatted up man prior to transitioning and thus was still evil you folks burn these bridges of people who want to help and understand and then get upset when no one will listen to you i dont dislike you i dont even know you but your attitude and the way you post will never bring about a reasonable discussion and people get sick of seeing people like you being extremely bigoted and racist while somehow calling others those exact same things i dunno lol i want to get it but i just cant sorry if i offended you but like i said thats the type of response you will get based on how you act
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah just repost what i said to your circlejerk of fucking losers instead of actually contesting me on it nice name by the way totally not racist at all cant be racist against white people amiright
ShitRedditSays,removed,gender studies ahahahaha lol omg you just made my day
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sorry redditors did we trigger you by suggesting that you follow the rules and etiquette of your own fucking cesspool
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres a huge difference between being antiillegal immigration and antiimmigrant as well as anti illegal immigration vs anti illegal immigrant political ideology takes nuance but so few people are able to make this distinction people just use immigration policy a legitimate thing to discuss as a vehicle for their hatred and bigotry
ShitRedditSays,removed,what is this from
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus cocksucking christ reddit what the hell
ShitRedditSays,removed,im saying its something you could keep in mind that may happen in the future blm has no true leadership or chain of command something stupid like this situation could happen theyve already blocked an ambulance httpwwwallenbwestcommattpalumboblacklivesmatterblockhighwaywhenambulancetriestocomethroughandthen
ShitRedditSays,removed,islam did something similar islam was spred via violent conquest through various parts of asia africa and europe
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive been seeing this fallacy a lot on this sub and ive been thinking about it for a while now i guess ill choose this post to talk about it despite the imminent downvotes that ill undoubtedly get for this what makes you think the people calling childhood obesity child abuse are the same as the ones that dont see child porn and sexual assault as child abuse reddit is not one person it is a collection of various individuals including those on this sub some people in the millionslarge userbase of reddit will be scumbags but by no means do they define reddit in the same way rthedonald often hits rall but that doesnt mean that the majority of reddit is protrump indeed most of reddit is made of small diverse communities the few assholes that often make it to the front page often represent a vocal minority and even amongst said assholes people have varying opinions it just seems disingenuous to paint them all with the same brush even if you disagree with one specific idea of theirs
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes the kid is so smart and you can tell because of a photograph its not pointless and cruel its actual concerns if her parents continue to misstreat her all her childhood and teenhood and she would grow up to be a landwhale do you really think she would love herself influencing a child to grow up in an abusive and unhealthy way that could major into severe medical problems isnt cute and people arent assholes for being concerned about it
ShitRedditSays,removed,jokes are totally supposed to represent ones political views and god forbid people laugh at them or they are all homophobic racist and sexist
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know youre on srs right you should be worried about your own health because this is a sub dedicated to sitting on your ass and trolling people all day and dont worry about me i exercise and im doing quite fine for myself im no physical god so i am sorry if that doesnt give me the right to be concerned about a childs health im just above average but i doubt you care eitherway i love how you retaliate to insulting me because i am defending those people shows a big sign of immaturity
ShitRedditSays,removed,same
ShitRedditSays,removed,why ya downvoting the bot he has rights too and is just doing his job
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can discuss it with reason but the man still has zero say as only the woman gets to make the choice
ShitRedditSays,removed,any time you want people do it and have been doing it for a long time
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a huge sweeping statement to say about a large subreddit worth of people i am grateful to have kind and wonderful parents that could not be better people and a successful brother who im close with i have a close friendship group that i can trust with anything too why are you filled with such hate to attack people so aggressively
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao wtf yeah were the insignificant ones
ShitRedditSays,removed,a little harsh wouldnt you say
ShitRedditSays,removed,why so much hate
ShitRedditSays,removed,dude youre clearly way less happy with your life than whoever it is youre shouting at deep breaths
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am not okay with this comment white people have done a lot of shitty things led by a well entrenched power clique a clique that bullies colonizes enslaves and pillages the clique bullies their own too they bully their own into doing horrible things and those people then have to suffer ptsd for the rest of their life while being discarded by the same clique they served hell they colonize enslave and pillage their own too if it suits them what do you think corporations are doing to their consumers white people in general arent a shitwad of a race they are just like any other race human it is the power clique that manages that we ought to be making fun of on this subreddit we also ought to watch out for those same cliques forming amongst other groups of humans i am not okay with this comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao same
ShitRedditSays,removed,projecting much
ShitRedditSays,removed,pretty sure that already happens httpsislimgfnacryjpg
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love how almost every comment in that thread has been reported but somehow were the ones brigading
ShitRedditSays,removed,never said you were downvoting yourselves dumbass just saying youre kinda the pot calling the kettle black here srs is most famous for brigading and youre definitely not going to make anybody like you by being such a childish bitch
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit is this satire you sound like something from subreddit simulator
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait was it ever not funny also im pretty sure white cultures are made fun of as well french people smell irish are starving drunks british have bad teeth welsh fuck goats americans are fat gun nuts
ShitRedditSays,removed,in the spirit of debate i want to hear the other side of the argument for the ability to withdraw consent as im not following this any takers
ShitRedditSays,removed,you get downvoted then claim that everyone who downvoted you is hated by everyone and their existence is pathetic because you got downvoted i think i know who the one who is actually probably hated
ShitRedditSays,removed,what sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha you are so bitter please tell me more about how ill die cold and alone while you furiously rant into your echo chamber over inconsequential bullshit pretty much everything you said in your post is a reflection of your own greatest fears of how you are perceived and theyre all true nobody cares about you or your opinion or this insular little clique of closeminded bigots enjoy the bond you hold on this website with other anonymous losers like you because this is as good as it will ever be for you chucklefucks have fun living a life of emptiness and dying cold and alone you earned it ❤️
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hate to be that guy but child support is like quid per week for a poor guy thats almost all of what a kid needs that an adult wouldnt use anyway extra electricity water food and clothes will be covered by that men pay for that shit and they get say and are biased against in custody battles thats a shitty deal
ShitRedditSays,removed,different bits of reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,but they dont pay nearly as much and have preference in court cases
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can say that all you want but ive seen bias against the father happen too many times a well adjusted providing father with a steady job didnt get preference over a junkie bitch of a mother who the kids didnt even want to live with thats one that i have personally seen the results of
ShitRedditSays,removed,were not the ones with a safe space sub mocking other people that cant reply back ya triggered wanks cant take a joke daddy issues much
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,who gives a shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,the nazis were the biggest party in the parliament and hitler was appointed as chancellor because of that i dont really see how that isnt a democratic process
ShitRedditSays,removed,im ok with this
ShitRedditSays,removed,ahhh casual racism under the guise of equality
ShitRedditSays,removed,rimverysmart
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is classic case of hugboxing
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh no a joke how will we ever get over this
ShitRedditSays,removed,another day in ciswhite reddit utopia
ShitRedditSays,removed,can you quote when hes ever said that
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats kind of funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,bash
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree that theyre an asshole but lets not ping people directly
ShitRedditSays,removed,or maybe its a reddit were the mods dont show any bias and let views even the extreme ones share their viewpoint
ShitRedditSays,removed,makes me sad that cuck is the word they use cause it really demeans a legitimate and wonderful fetish i love being cuckolded
ShitRedditSays,removed,well lets hope he has a sense of humor unlike this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this what qualifies as nazi apologism these days
ShitRedditSays,removed,sounds like a nazi belief you got going there
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats not alone why you got banned you have several choice comments on your profile that led to your ban because i cant search modmail and pick out your ban reasons ill pick three comments that also contributed to your ban someing made in china is not a blatant ripoff pick one and only one and gems like is that what you were doing by gang raping little children by the thousands and genociding you are slavic isis and its not ironic at all ivan russia has the most fascists and the most violent xenophobes in the world a product of their culture of hate and something that went the krokodil must be rotting your brain what makes you think personal attacks vapid generalizations and whatever the hell that was about china is okay it really isnt okay so my request to you is please stop behaving in this sanctimonious manner youre just as bad as every single one of the other rule breakers worldnews does explicitly prohibit bigotry personal attacks shill accusations name calling and other things we do our very best in trying to uphold the standards we see for the sub which includes hiring more mods like rscience its a long process people like you dont really help when your beliefs passions and agenda overtakes your respect for the rules of the sub to reiterate you got banned because you broke rules not because the mods agree or disagree with your comments the mods dont have time to politic with users theres thousands of different users daily and its impossible to do what youre saying remove approve ban and unban based on one agenda when different mods hold different values and philosophies so we all settle in the middle and follow the rules and if you and other users cant uphold it you get banned that may rankle you but it doesnt make it false as for the comments youve listed i see a couple that lie in a gray area but most dont really break rules its disagreeable but if i removed everything i disagreed with i wouldnt be a very good mod
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be wholly fair that just means hes referencing a joke not stating that in a few days from now he will rape a high school student i may sound crazy but i have a feeling hes not actually into child rape not sure but i have a good feeling i dont think we should make assumptions about people from what they write on a reddit forum
ShitRedditSays,removed,first of all thats absurd i may be biased speaking here as a worldnews mod but these are unfounded allegations youre making here the mods filter as many comments referring to other subs as possible depending on tone and content whether or not a couple of mods are trump supporters is irrelevant because there is bias in moderation we dont see the point in engaging in something as futile as dismissing legitimate supporters of the president elect unless they also break the rules
ShitRedditSays,removed,i know this sucks as the roaches sense the safety they are all coming out of hiding its revolting these people are starting to feel safe saying these things but let me argue the merits of this on here we cant do anything other than argue and they really dont care to listen but as they get more emboldened they will show their faces that is when we make racists afraid again fuck these people every time i read this shit it just motivates me to clean my riffle and pray these idiots show faces and when these mother fuckers crawl out of their caves and come for whatever brown people they are afraid of that day i have mm of freedom for them
ShitRedditSays,removed,hi there
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikishockhumour
ShitRedditSays,removed,you know whats not funny mocking sexual abuse victims making light of their tragedy well not funny to normal sane people i guess redditors dont count
ShitRedditSays,removed,and they sent me a condescending pm too
ShitRedditSays,removed,can i please shoot this person
ShitRedditSays,removed,ikr there was one time where some cis white male trespassed on my safespace with a tray of chicken nuggies he swore at me so i screamed right back at him and slammed the door on him i couldnt believe it happened my ptsd was so triggered right then i was just so in shock from the results that night i thought the world wasnt so racist sexist ableist bigoted cisgendered and intolerable i just wanted someone to fix this country i wanted hillary to win an office of the land how is she losing i thought she was so honest and perfect for our countys economy
ShitRedditSays,removed,fucking generalisations
ShitRedditSays,removed,ban me
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre actually total strangers
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is that vote manipulation
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually im a lurker on this sub but thanks for your assumtions so i ask again as your previous comment did not answer how is that post vote manipulation in any way
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,im sure all of you are just rubbing your sexualities in your parents disappointed faces
ShitRedditSays,removed,same for anyone whos kin
ShitRedditSays,removed,yes it does
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit you guys cannot take a joke b
ShitRedditSays,removed,nobody makes fun of actual diagnosed ptsd you know most trigger warning shitposts are making fun of people that dont have actual ptsd but act like they do
ShitRedditSays,removed,to be clear gay retard is what the dude in the green suit is called by his fanssubs take that how you want but its the reasoning behind it
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont understand why this is a problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,i honestly agree with this fuck those bullshit tumblrisms
ShitRedditSays,removed,daily reminder that being trans is a mental disorder
ShitRedditSays,removed,ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 👃🏻👃🏻👃🏻☝🏻️☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
ShitRedditSays,removed,go fuck yoursewait nevermind you wont
ShitRedditSays,removed,its funny because its stupid no one takes a person like that seriously upvotes arent evidence of agreement
ShitRedditSays,removed,that was kind of racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,nice
ShitRedditSays,removed,sometimes and sometimes jokes deter behaviour
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont see this as in some way intolerant of dealing with females in a mature way immaturity isnt intolerance its just childishness its worth ignoring and going to talk to people who do care about feminismissues most pertinent to women
ShitRedditSays,removed,i was the only one who responded to you so who else is talking
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just dont understand why you dont think that was racist also im a grown ass man
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh jesus christ youre immature
ShitRedditSays,removed,funny how you idiots at srs proclaim to be morallyfaultless champions of equality and then go on to discriminate against people because of their sexuality gender and skin color hypocrites but this will go completely over your head because its obvious youre all specialsnowflake teenagers who just need to have a victim status you people are so much worse than the racists and bigots you claim to be against at least those people are discreet about it pathetic keyboardwarrior losers have to make up things to get offended by to give your worthless lives meaning
ShitRedditSays,removed,real talk though who doesnt
ShitRedditSays,removed,but isnt heshe entitled to that opinion i thought you guys liked expressions of free speech and what not i really only sub here because i love drama and watching arguments i get where you guys are coming from with most of the posts on here and while i disagree with a lot of them many of them are based in reasonable pretense like i understand why you would be upset about the nc bathroom thing thats bullshit its a nonissue for sure no one but the business should be allowed to decide which bathroom you use that is not for the state to decide but this this is silly its becoming witchhunting this person just wants fantasize about a video game character so let them dont judge himher for their preferences isnt that what youre all about
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets go to remote villages and use a test that has been quite well proven and even by design not meant to be across cultures and use that study while i agree with most of your comment im unfortunately going to have to call you out here youre incorrect on this point iq tests havent been proven to be culturally biased youre either misinformed on the science or purposefully making things up heres a entitled survey of opinions on the primacy of g and social consequences of ability testing a comparison of expert and nonexpert views detailing the results of intelligence experts and nonexpert applied psychologists views on multiple questions about cognitive abilities tests the results are as follows subjectsnot biasedbiased non experts they found that of the experts believed that cognitive ability tests iq tests did not have any racial bias as did of the nonexperts compared to of experts and of nonexperts who believed the tests were racially biased as far back as a panel from the national research council and the national academy of sciences and concluded that cultural bias explained virtually none of the racial variance in iq scores in the american psychological association formed a panel and it resulted in the publication entitled which concluded considered as predictors of future performance the tests do not seem to be biased against african americans in following the release of the bell curve intelligence researchers authored a document entitled laying out postulates that they believed to represent mainstream science on intelligence the postulate was intelligence tests are not culturally biased against american blacks or other nativeborn englishspeaking peoples in the us rather iq scores predict equally accurately for all such americans regardless of race and social class individuals who do not understand english well can be given either a nonverbal test or one in their native language
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not just subsaharan africans african americans haitians also have incredibly low iqs but the lowest would probably be the people of papua new guinea
ShitRedditSays,removed,is this for real or another troll
ShitRedditSays,removed,so whats the problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,upvoted to trigger sjw
ShitRedditSays,removed,just to play devils advocate the reason it was downvoted i believe is that the streamer in question is not actually a paedophile he joked that the character in game who is fancied another character who was
ShitRedditSays,removed,this obviously doesnt belong here since no one is willing or able to have a civil conversation about historical facts
ShitRedditSays,removed,right its i mean come on
ShitRedditSays,removed,why are you here if you hate it so much
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats my camp
ShitRedditSays,removed,i provided my source min ago in the comment below
ShitRedditSays,removed,well they do men are more impulsive and take more risks
ShitRedditSays,removed,for once theyre not just referring to chicago
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,not too sure about that rape thing although men almost invariably get laughed clear out of every court room and police station in the land if they try to report themselves as a victim of rape however that bit about women choosing lower paying jobs when was the last time you ever saw a woman as an industrial electrician miner automotive technician hvac plumber painter construction worker machinist these are all jobs that make excellent wages and yet they have almost no women yet look at those professions cushy cushy cushy hardly any manualphysical labour involved
ShitRedditSays,removed,can people just take it as the joke is intended a joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,good point ill leave
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats the issue with this
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey everybody whats this place about
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just think op is an idiot for thinking these comments against short people represent the average woman and then lamenting how oppressed men are because they cant voice their hatred against fat women hi im op whats going on
ShitRedditSays,removed,well for one short men cant do anything about height but fat women can exercise and change and it seems that making fun of short men is still acceptable but dont you dare state that you are not attracted to fat women or you will get crucified
ShitRedditSays,removed,they just hate short men yeah
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not attracted to larger women so i do dismiss them for the purpose of dating
ShitRedditSays,removed,most women are not attracted to short men whats terrible is all those women who post hateful things about short men arent called on it like how men who post hateful things about fat women are thats kinda fucked up
ShitRedditSays,removed,its not the dismissing its the blatant wishing of short guys to die thats the issue look i get people cant really control what they are attracted to but going out of your way to insult them is terrible and should be addressed
ShitRedditSays,removed,perhaps simply seeing an obese person signals that they have problems and thats not attractive to most people short peoplethey cant control that at all thats not an obvious indication of a people who have issues but is really tall there arent going to be many women interested in that man just because hes tall ive seen and heard women proclaiming that because a guy is tall thats the very reason they are attracted even though he has many faults such as being an abuser tall seems to be the on most womens lists of attractiveness
ShitRedditSays,removed,the twitter accounts of women saying men under should just kill themselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats cool i agree with that everybody should just stop being so insecure and stop hating on others
ShitRedditSays,removed,i can be an idiot most times its cool learn from your mistakes right no apologies necessary have a great night
ShitRedditSays,removed,ouch well this is a tough subject for me maybe ive been drinking too much of the koolaid but i kind of agree with the first part of ops post the fat people hate part is terrible and its good to see hes being called out on it and rightly so but i dunno oh well its times like these im glad ive given up on therapy and medication ill probably have killed myself before i can become a full on member of trp or the incel community one less potential shitbag in existence
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont really appreciate you alluding god to pretty skydaddy do you mind changing that
ShitRedditSays,removed,oj is innocent dont you have faith in the justice system
ShitRedditSays,removed,related if you havent tried fat chickstry fat chicks s like skinny chicks except theres more there there theyre very comfortableand them curves them curves though sorry if thats coming across as objectifying the plussized ladies theyre justgoddamn ya know these dipshits are missing out
ShitRedditSays,removed,nothing surprises me anymore i live in a world where clowns have become politically incorrect
ShitRedditSays,removed,shh
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a woman so i think hitting another woman is ok in this situation
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,so women getting hit matters more then men getting hit nice equality there you loser
ShitRedditSays,removed,sexist
ShitRedditSays,removed,full definition of sexism prejudice or discrimination based on sex behavior conditions or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex youre an idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,manletsirl
ShitRedditSays,removed,this subreddit always links me to the best reddit posts thanks guys
ShitRedditSays,removed,at least they shit on everyone equally
ShitRedditSays,removed,i feel like they say things from both sides of the story of course they make both sides look like assholes but at least they are unbiased for the most part
ShitRedditSays,removed,upvoting because its my comment cheers
ShitRedditSays,removed,in my experience working in tech many tend toward conservative libertarianism through a combination of mild autism spectrum disorder and never having lacked for anything growing up im not surprised that they would prefer reddit since many of their ideas of the world beyond their bubble tend to be halfformed at best
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait you said exactly what the poster above you said you just changed the color of the person in your hypothetical situation can someone explain to me why this poster is being downvoted im asking honestly not to be a dick
ShitRedditSays,removed,not all illegal immigrants are brown you fucking racist bigot
ShitRedditSays,removed,good get the fuck you ugly pink haired fat pigs itll be the most exercise youve probably ever gotten oink oink
ShitRedditSays,removed,well thats probably cause youre a stupid fucking woman get back in the kitchen and take your shoes off
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you still believe in evil you need to grow the fuck up
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahahaha your cuck tears are delicious we won you lost we are the future you are the past just as the trump train has no brakes the new right has no brakes we will roll over you cucks like you were never even here
ShitRedditSays,removed,nobody in palestine asked for this savagery dont drag us into this palestine is a useless copout used by islamistsb who strangley kill everyone but israelis
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would you assume that the protesters are all minorities there was no mention of that anywhere
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are brown like cockroaches its rational for me to be mad
ShitRedditSays,removed,so is it okay to non white mass shooters
ShitRedditSays,removed,well its like my cousin said they either turn into actual racist people or self hating white people hate breeds hate as they say
ShitRedditSays,removed,technically he was half asian but the point still stands he was a horrible person nothing about him or what he did was brilliant
ShitRedditSays,removed,which name do you know naomi campbell or binx walton
ShitRedditSays,removed,well look them up and see which has the longer wikipedia page
ShitRedditSays,removed,how many humans does it take to make a baby
ShitRedditSays,removed,do you honesty believe there is not a single honest person in those subs how do you expect to gain momentum without explaining your cause to people who are interested this is why you lost and will continue losing let the god emperor teach you how to win again
ShitRedditSays,removed,so it seems im famous
ShitRedditSays,removed,by definition shitposts are uninspired and it got a healthy number of upvotes so im pretty happy about that
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont you think this may be a little bit of an overreaction on their part though
ShitRedditSays,removed,no mother fucker
ShitRedditSays,removed,elliot rodger wasnt white
ShitRedditSays,removed,keep losing cuck its a good look for you
ShitRedditSays,removed,yea so are you a bugot
ShitRedditSays,removed,no honey no
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha this sub seems more obsessed with what they think
ShitRedditSays,removed,lets reverse the situation isnt not taking the pill and getting pregnant one of the textbook moves women use to keep men in a relationship
ShitRedditSays,removed,pls delete this comment youre going to get me downvoted
ShitRedditSays,removed,nickels are a spook
ShitRedditSays,removed,well its in the category of funny because its true said by the right person the right way it draws attention to the plight of women getting paid less not saying that this was the right way but i have heard similar from female standup comics
ShitRedditSays,removed,woah thats real fucking spooky
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbf hes explaining how the law works and what is deemed illegallegal not his personal view on it
ShitRedditSays,removed,both sex and gender or just gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,please forgive any ignorance on my part but what are the other genders if you identify as a man then youre a man right i do my best to accept all people but i dont understand how there are more than two genders also for the record my aunt was a man who identified as a woman and i loved her all the same she helped raise me and i didnt even know that she was trans until i was grown up unfortunately i cant ask her these questions because she past many years ago
ShitRedditSays,removed,explain how it is im interested
ShitRedditSays,removed,say all the made up words you want in my mind there are three categories female male or mentally unstable
ShitRedditSays,removed,how is gender a social construct you are either born a male or a female its that simple its a physical thing how you feel mentally or how you identify may differ from how you are physically but that doesnt all of a sudden mean im a woman in a mans body it means there are mental issues i have to deal with its like if i just woke up one day and said i feel like deep down i am actual a merman im going to go and get my legs sewn together ridiculous
ShitRedditSays,removed,true the difference being though that male and female actually exist and have done for millions and millions of years where as all these new terms that get aimlessly thrown around are completely unnecessary we all have different characteristics like different things have our own unique interests and personalities but at the end of the day we are all male or female you cant just pick and choose genders whenever you feel like it
ShitRedditSays,removed,no any naked picture of a person under is child pornography
ShitRedditSays,removed,so they retreat to their safe spaces to talk about the evils of safe spaces huh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i kind of wish i was there because im a bigger dude and would have loved to see them stop me from going through without becoming violent towards me i wanna put money on this just being a fat neckbeard
ShitRedditSays,removed,what has this to do with post
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre only safe spaces in the most literal way
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean this is correct though isnt it two teenagers having consensual sex recording it and sharing it with a third teenager can result in the distribution of child porn with no rape involved and with nobody over the age of having seen the pornography doesnt the existence of even one example of them being different things vindicate this guy the statement he made is factually correct
ShitRedditSays,removed,so youre saying hes right then
ShitRedditSays,removed,so what does male or female stand for when you consider gender as a spectrum what is the factor that is varying
ShitRedditSays,removed,no one said they were high schoolers someone thought they might be that was after i commented i thought they were older university if anything
ShitRedditSays,removed,im astral gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,but isnt that the same mentality of the assholes who say well she shouldnt have dressed provocatively seems toxic all around
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont forget to tickle his balls when you suck his feminine penis
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,what
ShitRedditSays,removed,what about the guy who replied to me hes gay and white are you gonna stop him from going about his day simply because of his skin color
ShitRedditSays,removed,about the level of self awareness i expected
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a safe space for bigots to spew their bigotry without judgment or criticism they can be who they are with no fear of repercussions thats the irony behind the right wing antisafe space talk
ShitRedditSays,removed,its tough when its true
ShitRedditSays,removed,try our famous cuckburger
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know about you guys but i have a dick its not comfortable to squish it you can ban me now
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a surprise hes a trumptard too
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have a dick and i literally have to shove my balls up inside where they go when its cold and fold it between my legs so i can feel normal and not hate myself i know right as a feminist man whenever i look in the mirror i have to tuck my dick between my legs whenever i dress myself in the mirror to avoid the crippling selfhatred
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are not the cucks no no they are the real cucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,it legitimately surprises me that someone can be so obtuse as to misinterpret what they were describing in that way theory many male feminists are actually closetedrepressed mtf transgender kind of like how many antigay republicans have suppressed desires themselves thoughts
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have a question and im genuinely hoping you can enlighten me are you going to cry when president trump is sworn into office just over a month from now if yes any plans to post a video on the internet i need something to watch while im manspreading on the subway
ShitRedditSays,removed,i also hope you realize that when people complain about manspreading they generally only care when you are actively preventing others from taking a seat by doing so and if you are doing that thats pretty shitty so your problem is with people taking up too much space on the subway and you think this is a gendered issue worthy of a movement ostensibly championing womens liberation no im not going to cry not even a little thats a shame im always looking for new ways to fill up my liberal tears mug
ShitRedditSays,removed,when women do it theyre generally rebuked quietly and tolerate it whereas when men do it they try to excuse it with ridiculous lines about their genitals well i suppose they could always crush their genitals like a pretransition mtf transgendered person who is ashamed of their body as for the liberal tears mug youll want to be careful with srs in that respect i am neither a classical or modern social liberal and the same can be said of a lot of people here yeah i know its a part of what turns this sub into an unwitting best of compilation since im inclusive ill let you guys fill the mug all the same
ShitRedditSays,removed,i manspread all the time as a female take up that space when you have it it makes me feel comfortable and confident it feels good
ShitRedditSays,removed,people are not transgendered they are transgender in the same way that someone is not gayed they are gay
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love this username it invokes the exact reaction im looking for every time
ShitRedditSays,removed,imagine being so braindead as to actually be a communist dont worry though ill buy a communist tears mug after i collect one for every imaginary gender
ShitRedditSays,removed,as an asian who doesnt really involve with anything in the us i think half of this sub are pretty stupid for raging at some jokes but they have a point when it comes to actually serious matters
ShitRedditSays,removed,i always visit this sub best way to find funny reddit content although tbh since rjesuschristreddit has taken off its been outclassed but its always better to keep more avenues
ShitRedditSays,removed,if youre not male then what are you
ShitRedditSays,removed,i really had hope that this sub was going to get better but i just cant see anything wrong with this comment the buzzfeed video has one of the shittiest presentation and one sided nonsense ever i really really wanted to see this place as logical thinks and for the most part it seems like a good lot of you are but this is just too much if you can change my view then go ahead because i just cant wrap my head around this
ShitRedditSays,removed,its best to alternate between rthedonald and here for added effect two sides of the same coin though the former is more funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,link to a single completely normal average cute instagram photo of one of the girls they have nearly followers dont pull that bologna
ShitRedditSays,removed,based on the original comment it sounds like they were just trying to explain and understand the mindset that led results of the study they werent trying to indicate any sort of approval but rather just say that theyve also observed the phenomenon in the way people behave on reddit whoever posted this willfully took the original comment way out of context
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think they are saying they thinks its justified the second paragraph describing encountering that mentality on reddit is which does of course its disgusting if anyone really thinks that i just dont think that this person was saying they think that
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats still not average
ShitRedditSays,removed,and the people werent calling her an instahole based on the content of the photo
ShitRedditSays,removed,this i thought rmensrights was for mensrights not anti feminism
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean another year old shouldnt be called a pedo for dating her i mean i doubt you meant them as well but it should be mentioned because people that date younger looking people can get a lot of harassment despite them being the same age not to mention infantilizing a teenager is pretty mean its just kinda a rude thing to say
ShitRedditSays,removed,white people suck big time
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah talk about an us vs them attitude youre fucking hopeless
ShitRedditSays,removed,its literally a word for animals you are aware that humans are animals right
ShitRedditSays,removed,dae autist isnt an insult
ShitRedditSays,removed,try voat its real progressive
ShitRedditSays,removed,this triggers me orcs were changed by daedra malacath the hist created argonians and has nothing to do with oblivion or daedra psychedelic trees not demons
ShitRedditSays,removed,so what youre saying is that the profession which requires some of the fastest reactions in the world is not a good gauge of the reaction speeds of people are you mentally stable this is like saying i know the mens world record for deadlifts is pounds and hundreds of men lift and the womens record is pounds but that doesnt mean that men are stronger than women
ShitRedditSays,removed,racist thats where youre wrong bud
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a great moderator pussy ass pos
ShitRedditSays,removed,so more people can see it and understand that these people exist and thats the best way of defeating it drag their opinions out in the light
ShitRedditSays,removed,i just found this reddit today and im unfamiliar with the general culture so i need to ask a question are you guys mad because you think theyre not joking and on some level wishes to have sex with a year old or do you know hes joking but are upset because you believe this shouldnt be joked about
ShitRedditSays,removed,says the person who a regular poster on srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,ive seen a lot people say i dont hate white people when they really do
ShitRedditSays,removed,jigaboos kill whitey whites thats racist jigaboos muh systematic racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,says the person who openly hates men
ShitRedditSays,removed,said the person posting on the biggest cesspool on reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,so you feel it is a better option to ignore them what we have then is a bubble where they reinforce their own belifes instead of having people ask the right questions to them ignoring ignorance usually dont pan out well
ShitRedditSays,removed,is there any evidence that shaming someone for their belifes actually work will that not just make them seek out more evidence that supports their claim its better that we show them they are there and they say some scary stuff and then smarter people than myself could maybe make a few of those people think twice you cant remove racism from the world but we can try to prevent it spreading
ShitRedditSays,removed,k cool so that means were going to start paying to educate ours now too because last time i checked chinese students were a fucking cashcow for us universities
ShitRedditSays,removed,resubmit
ShitRedditSays,removed,i disagree with this comic there very much was a bias toward clinton and against trump in the mainstream media however this bias only served to embolden those against clinton and it also served to make her seem more like a corporate figure than a public one also shes been involved with actual messed up political shit and that shouldnt be ignored however trump will almost certainly be involved in far far worse fucked up political shit i mean it only makes sense that his political record is thus far relatively clean not talking about his financial and legal affairs he doesnt have one
ShitRedditSays,removed,that could also be a post on this subreddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,can you explain how thats misogynstic im not agreeing or disagreeing just curious
ShitRedditSays,removed,like what
ShitRedditSays,removed,httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainthenletmebeevil
ShitRedditSays,removed,can we stop acting like hillary wasnt a terrible person now please the elections over theres no point in covering up the and id quite like to be able to return to an apparently leftwing sub without pretending that i dont give a shit about the lives of people in other countries
ShitRedditSays,removed,kill yourself achmed
ShitRedditSays,removed,where was the sexual harassment in the video did it happen before filming
ShitRedditSays,removed,what seems to be the problem sir
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think anyone should feel oppressed by the gif but i think the question is fair if two men hosts were oiling and groping an attractive woman on the today show would it be tolerated
ShitRedditSays,removed,you consider a lame dad joke to be sexual harassment q whats your name a hugh mongous you really think that exchange made the woman a victim of sexual harassment wow
ShitRedditSays,removed,true same also applies to feminism
ShitRedditSays,removed,he got a point
ShitRedditSays,removed,do it per capita and the statistics tell a far different picture
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy fuck people really think this way
ShitRedditSays,removed,i hope they get stabbed with a knife after triggering a schizophrenic with ptsd
ShitRedditSays,removed,i have seen some batshit crazy afrocentric stuff yeah the difference is that i had to look for it
ShitRedditSays,removed,its also when the rapist is a college student and the rape victim is an oversensitive sheltered sjw woman in college
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah this is not marital rape not even close
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you serious that guy was obviously joking about how people always have to comment about physical traits in the comments
ShitRedditSays,removed,you only accept a small part of all gender identities and sexualities outside the norm i identify as mayonnaise and am only attracted to vintage japanese motorcycles for some reason no one even here accepts this as a reasonable gender and sexuality
ShitRedditSays,removed,username checks out cough lower case cough
ShitRedditSays,removed,because i only support identities that exist
ShitRedditSays,removed,what about when the black children pull out guns on the cops
ShitRedditSays,removed,its true you know
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are on the internet being edgy they are not going to actually kill people or sanction it in real life
ShitRedditSays,removed,they are on the internet being edgy they are not going to actually kill people or sanction it in real life
ShitRedditSays,removed,wtf why would you nuke a sub that has one guy who is an edgelord jeezus
ShitRedditSays,removed,right and left is a scale of governmental control and fascism is left leaning due to its tendencies of big government source colege board ap textbooks
ShitRedditSays,removed,hitler was to jews what you tards are to white straight men
ShitRedditSays,removed,can anyone name another gender past two if you can i guarantee i can disprove how it must be separate from the two existing ones
ShitRedditSays,removed,no wonder meirl is so trash then
ShitRedditSays,removed,but they are funny everything is funny in some way to some one i thought you guys were accepting of everyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre funny to people who arent you
ShitRedditSays,removed,socially fascists are right wing in terms of extreme conservatism but left wing in how much power they have over the people and over the economy it was called national socialism for a reason
ShitRedditSays,removed,not if youre an edge lord
ShitRedditSays,removed,except socialism and capitalism are different economic systems and fascism is a political system there is no fascist system of economics but instead fascists preferred socialism because having capitalism meant that they had to allow their citizens more freedoms thats not to say you cant have a fascist capitalist system but it just ideologically doesnt mesh very well
ShitRedditSays,removed,haha thanks but i probably have to give credit to for coming up with the copypasta
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt say you were
ShitRedditSays,removed,i sexually identify as a redditor ever since i was a boy i dreamed of browsing over the internet and reposting transphobic memes and racist jokes people say to me that an emotionally mature intelligent person being a redditor is impossible but i dont care im beautiful im having a neurosurgeon remove my ability to feel empathy for other people from now on i want you guys to call me redditor and respect my right to belittle people who are different to me if you cant accept me youre an sjw and need to learn how to take a joke thank you for being so understanding
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh my god i was so confused why this had likes before i realized this was a copypasta

ShitRedditSays,removed,speaking on behalf of straight white men everywhere good riddance whores you did this to yourselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,comparing educations is an objective assessment that would be possible to do you might not like the answer however
ShitRedditSays,removed,in other words you think you are correct doesnt everybody believe the things that they think are true
ShitRedditSays,removed,uspez is a cuck 🐸🇺🇸maga🇺🇸🐸
ShitRedditSays,removed,two words free speech you can block a sub if you dont like it
ShitRedditSays,removed,but why are you talking about white supremicists
ShitRedditSays,removed,voat
ShitRedditSays,removed,i see youve already forgotten that whites in ohio and florida gave obama victories in both his elections but this time they are literally the klan back in and they werent though
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a straight white male i love that
ShitRedditSays,removed,right i never do anything for myself and this is how im repaid fuck these people

ShitRedditSays,removed,under budget ahead of schedule suck it srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,s h a d i l a y
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol the salt delicious tears
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,sure but what matters in life some people sitting behind a keyboard badmouthingmarginalizing you go out there and make a name for yourself break barriers and stereotypes and be the best you you can be change what you can control and hope others will follow
ShitRedditSays,removed,wait wasnt rpolitics bought out by the hilary team for months with their agenda onlyi dont really see the complaints here if anything thats the thing the admits should be looking into also reddit has been shit for ages now this election didnt change or prove that
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahaha yes yes let the salt flow
ShitRedditSays,removed,so butthurt lmao
ShitRedditSays,removed,vote manipulation you mean upvoting like voting like in an election ah i see liberal americans dont like it when things dont go their tolerant way then they must ban incinerate and cry racism kek
ShitRedditSays,removed,and now the fascists are rioting in the streets because their madam president lost fascism isnt exclusively for rightwings
ShitRedditSays,removed,hillary gave away state secrets while she was secretary of state that alone immediately disqualifies her for president
ShitRedditSays,removed,nah its shit
ShitRedditSays,removed,its over can we stop with all the blaming though pretty undignified
ShitRedditSays,removed,i thought spez was your hero
ShitRedditSays,removed,you can always do us all a favor and kill yourself slowly my dudr
ShitRedditSays,removed,what a fucking pussy
ShitRedditSays,removed,neanderthals had bigger brains then modern humans
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats the point their orange messiah is now potus
ShitRedditSays,removed,then leave
ShitRedditSays,removed,we would love to see you leave
ShitRedditSays,removed,so it is wrong to wish bad on those terrible people because they are poc sometimes i wonder if some people spend too much time on this sub that their reality changes as long as its white people getting beaten up okay thats how you get discriminated for being ugly fatty and i dont say this as an american i am a poc from south america yall are just delusional asa blackman bad scapegoat
ShitRedditSays,removed,as i said i am not american and i dont understand the language fully but from context travyoned cant be a bad enough word for these people they are shit people
ShitRedditSays,removed,democratically electing a president isnt the same thing as terrorism and instituting a theocracy that stones people to death by telling victims of terrorism that they asked for it by pushing muslims to extremism youre victimblaming enjoy your cognitive dissonance
ShitRedditSays,removed,as fucked up as that statement is i think he is on to something a lot of people that voted for trump voted in what they see as their best interests and their best interest being to preserve or reclaim a more unjust society where white people are systematically given an advantage people who voted trump arent crazy they are just racists themselves or doesnt mind racism
ShitRedditSays,removed,quite the opposite theres more correlational evidence for brain size and intelligence than there is for smoking and lung cancer im not sure where you got this from because if you do a search of the literature or even just google it the evidence is overwhelming before you reply just google it or better yet if youre wellversed in academia do a literature search and read some metaanalyses
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont know how this happened i voted for gary johnson so did all my friends i think i will move to canada now
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow emotions are a hell of a drug you dont know these guys for all you know they help poor peoplewhite and black when they cant afford to fix their car so they can get to work about out of their pocket last year oh did i mention both work part time at night to be able to keep their business open
ShitRedditSays,removed,this video depicts someone getting assaulted for a choice they made by someone who as a result of this choice will now argueably suffer more for reasons beyond his control this is so far from racism against white people its not even funny
ShitRedditSays,removed,the only vote for trump is a vote for trump
ShitRedditSays,removed,it sucks but at the end of the day he won an election and he did it with record low numbers at that point i would stop blaming him because it actually makes the democrats look ludicrously incompetent if you do id also stop calling him fascist because he clearly didnt wrestle power away from the establishment in fact looking at the numbers the establishment sort of gave it away
ShitRedditSays,removed,no fishy mclegbeard it was your shitty candidates fault you lost also your failed ideology throwing a nationwide temper tantrum yesterday and today just redpilled millions more people also the ussc is going to be in favor of conservatives for the next years and all of your so called progress is headed right where it belongs into the dumpster of failed leftist policies also you degenerates dont even have the means nor the nerve to fight any of this via arms
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok so without even knowing me youve already judged me as some animal who is uncaring and always making fun of people who are not me i see you also dont see me as my own person with my own beliefsjokes so instead of trying to understand you shut people like me out thank you for adding to the animosity
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahahaahahahahahahahaha
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow you got an that from four words
ShitRedditSays,removed,i laughed at this
ShitRedditSays,removed,if you primaried for clinton over sanders this really is your fault you can either learn from it or repeat it
ShitRedditSays,removed,twox is one of the most cancerous subs on reddit other than most of the default ones its the same circlejerk of the same garbage this product only ships in pink or purple they dont have the color i like x and y company are misogynistic racist and sexist can everybody give me karma points
ShitRedditSays,removed,how very eloquent
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am still physically sick to my stomach over this election im very worried about our future here is what i fear obamacare is going to be repealed all the work obama did on fighting climate change is going to be thrown out the window trump is going to stuff his cabinet with incompetent hateful clowns like palin christie gingrich and so on immigrants and vulnerable groups are going to suffer i dont really blame the people in middle america who voted for trump well i do but many of them are desperate and suffering from poor education and destroyed livelihoods i blame the dnc for not fielding the candidate that everyone could get behind and instead backing the elitisturban favorite i blame the media for giving free publicity for trump every time he opened his mouth instead of not feeding the fucking troll i blame voter suppression tactics by the gop i blame the asshole democrat voters who stayed home either because they thought hillary was sure to win or they didnt like her
ShitRedditSays,removed,jesus fuck this subreddit is cancer
ShitRedditSays,removed,that dude deserved what he got and so much more
ShitRedditSays,removed,shit website dont use it if you dont like it
ShitRedditSays,removed,beating up an old man with a group of people makes you even worse
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am pretty sure the trump voter who got his ass beat and car stolen is a victim though
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant believe youre defending beating the shit out of a guy and stealing his car because he disagrees with you
ShitRedditSays,removed,when you have celebrities saying shit like this after the riots happened she backtracked and you have obama implying trump was happy the kkk enorsed him hillary saying his supporters are bigots cnn talking heads complaining how theyre scared of what to say to their children and then this claim of bigotry carried on by progressives on social media and having the two biggest social media websites continually deleting conservative news trends you are absolutely disrespecting democracy not to mention the fact that it was proven that the dnc was sending in people to cause violence at trump rallies and trump supporters being hunted down and attacked for their political choices the people that continue this hatred that dismiss half the country as bigots are actively showing their disdain for democracy because they attempt to negate the legitimacy of anything that opposes them and that can not be denied are there racist trump supporters absolutely and i want no fucking part of them and any ive seen in rthedonald i and many others have called out by the way many minorities of different backgrounds posted on there that they voted trump so the idea that it is a monolith of angry white people is a lie finally do the racists and the kkk have any insight into the reason trump was elected if you say yes then to not be hypocritical the rioters the people that dragged the old man out of his car yesterday and the people that attacked men women and teenagers in san jose are emblematic of your average hillary supporter
ShitRedditSays,removed,nigger
ShitRedditSays,removed,white genocide shit neo nazis rave about is starting to sound not all that terrible i am afraid you are starting to sound reasonable wtf
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean and if you find the longer video which is overlayed with a shittily recorded rap saying fuck donald trump you can see that he does get dragged by the car
ShitRedditSays,removed,i came from rall but by the looks of it op wrote a well written and truly accurate from his perspective comment then this sub comes up and shits all over it it seems like from the op race and sexual orientation is unimportant all that is important is that an individual cares for their country and fellow citizens truly united this sub however seems to focus solely on peoples differences and hating anyone who is different complete cesspool and i can understand how the regulars here turn volatile
ShitRedditSays,removed,this might be the biggest anti white circle jerk ive seen in a while
ShitRedditSays,removed,we dont use tard as an insult hereabouts removed until edited
ShitRedditSays,removed,yeah all those rich millionaires in the rust belt
ShitRedditSays,removed,then why isnt it a closeofage law seems like your law says otherwise
ShitRedditSays,removed,well if youre a legal citizen theres no problem
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,being as though i am op i think i deserve a chance to explain my point anyone campaigning against the notion of america first immediately loses my vote that was said immediately after the thing posted i voted for many issues but in the thread i laid out a list of like reasons i voted for trump im not ashamed im proud to oppose the bullshit and circlejerksmoke up the ass blowing that took place before this election ended i voted for the future of the country and for someone who is closest in line with my values if im held liable for the bad things trump has done and said all i have to say is that anyone who voted for clinton must take pride in all of her fucked up episodes im not an idiot im finishing up my biology degree at a pretty decent college being yelled at by liberal arts and political science majors means little to nothing to me im totally open to debate anyone but please leave out the one liners that include lol are you serious ive seen that in every thread by liberal idiots or any other reply that ignores the fact that a discussion involves both sides adding something worthwhile not just vaughn replies to show your liberal friends you disagree
ShitRedditSays,removed,notice how i said if you want to argue they believe in liberal economic policies you can say so i would argue this they dont actually believe in them the ron paul libertarian types dont believe in any taxation or federal regulation they dont believe in civil liberties either to suggest they do ignores their opinions on things like the civil rights and voting rights act now sense they dont believe in both social and economically liberal believes i would argue that my claim of them being libertarians is more appropriate as it has a very narrow scope of definition
ShitRedditSays,removed,is the legal age of consent in the uk
ShitRedditSays,removed,ooof i see the moose population is in a frenzy today lets see if a song cheers anyone up no abortions for u no abortions for uuu no abortions dear srs no abortions for uuuuuuuu
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wasnt brigaiding i just thought it was interesting and thought id share if there was brigaiding that ensued it wasnt my intention i respect your right to operate and be amongst those you have shared opinions im sorry so many of you dont like me
ShitRedditSays,removed,farleft definition of liberal actually its a pretty standard political science definition although the term has two meanings in terms of ideology liberalism is the belief in free markets and individualism while a liberal attitude is the belief in making evolutionary progressive change from within the system rather than engaging in revolution what we call liberalism in north america is better described ideologically as social democracy
ShitRedditSays,removed,i promise you hillary is not thought of as a sex object
ShitRedditSays,removed,out out out
ShitRedditSays,removed,rthathappened
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not sure about we but there certainly was a lot of redbaiting from the liberal clinton types is this in dispute
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont like your own tactics being used against you fat sjw fucks
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats pretty unfair of course i dont do all hillary voters by contrast support the black panther party
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do know its been proven she lied right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i really dont see anything wrong with the linked post and instead the country will be ruled by the mainstream media the treated bernie awfully for many months the and a cnn employee now dnc head donna brazile slipped debate questions to the clinton campaign in advance wikileaks podesta emails the commenter also points out that feminist terminology pr marketing was used unfairly against progressives i have absolutely seen it used by clinton and her surrogates to defend neoliberal policies clinton supporter i dont know what the commenter meant by the socialist marxist bit but i did see quite a bit of redbaiting over the past few months as well
ShitRedditSays,removed,uhhhh look her plight is terrible but this comment is in response to why the us embassy cannot help her get away from her husband especially in light of the fact that no laws are being broken in jordan as far as i understand it its pretty tragic but the point stands she made some monumentally dangerous decisions and now the consequences are biting her extremely hard what has to happen is her us support network is going to have to come help her i am not defending his actions and i wish jordan wasnt this way but i dont think this is a particularly shitty thing to say from a legal perspective these are lawyers generally advising people how to generally fix their problems many of which are created by user stupidity
ShitRedditSays,removed,cant speak for everyone but i dont care about the objectification of anyone but i dislike the hypocrisy in people always saying women are objectified when men are objectified as well these are the same people who say theyre for equality but say nothing about mens issues
ShitRedditSays,removed,beating your wife genocide got it
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is nothing hitler could have done to be a good person well he did kill hitler so theres that
ShitRedditSays,removed,is there a shitsrssays sub this would be perfect
ShitRedditSays,removed,til birdcalls are innovative and light years ahead of legends
ShitRedditSays,removed,its always struck me as being so overthetop as to be hyperbolic
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean isnt this similar to being in a long term relationship with someone and thinking about spending the rest of your lives together then exploring the possibility of having a child together only to have the fact that your so is trans and the both of you are unable to make a child or the scenario of your so hiding the fact that they have a family history of certain genetic issues like earlyonset alzheimer or some other really shitty thing you could have avoided bringing someone into a life of suffering if that information was on the table a relationship should have an open flow of information
ShitRedditSays,removed,i disagree that its glorifying its putting his fucked up emotions out in the open for the world to see but thats a big part of what art is
ShitRedditSays,removed,i would disagree with point hes implying that the girl is a hypocrit for saying no niggers and then doing a bunch of black people anyway number is definitely true but saying that that is the vibe that she gives off isnt misogynistic but just giving an interpretation to the way she dresses as for number he just implied black guys would be there thats fine
ShitRedditSays,removed,the man has a point
ShitRedditSays,removed,take your girl swimming in acid on the first date see what she really looks like
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh so i make a funny kinda offensive joke where i jokingly assuming stuff about this racist person what does this subreddit do start assuming stuff about me like i watch tons of porn i am racist and sexist and that i think the piercings mean she like black guys which none is true how about instead of bashing me you guys look in the mirror and get a sense of humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,females arent capable of making jokes that requires independent thought
ShitRedditSays,removed,smug clinton supporters are the most annoying fucking people on the planet right now
ShitRedditSays,removed,as if its surprising at this point
ShitRedditSays,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
ShitRedditSays,removed,a suicide squadron that never actually flew a single mission
ShitRedditSays,removed,that was hilarious
ShitRedditSays,removed,swm seeking swf to spawn master race must have genetic test available for proof of worthiness mud people need not apply
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,youre an idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,in all fairness im okay with jokes at donald trumps expense
ShitRedditSays,removed,implying mayokin know anything besides their own selfish desires ishygddt
ShitRedditSays,removed,perfectly reasonable its a joke that relies on surprising me with violence and racism subversion of expectations
ShitRedditSays,removed,shrugs i personally dont mind the joke i completely understand why you guys might to each their own and im a liberal who believes in rape culture by the way i just think we should focus more on teaching what is and is not consent working to give more support to victims of rape and decrying genuine issues in our society rather than focusing on a joke one dude made on reddit that one time
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,how do yall feel about that teaching philosophy in american high schools would make for a better society thing on the front pageunless you have the philosophy sub blocked personally i feel its even more drivel than what is normally spewed out onto rphilosophy and reddit in general
ShitRedditSays,removed,do teenedge queens make downvote pilgrimages to this place
ShitRedditSays,removed,im fine with this dont act like theyve never harmed any communities the only thing surprising is that rworldnews upvoted this
ShitRedditSays,removed,nice doubles standards
ShitRedditSays,removed,happy yom kipp pour if this is offensive please let me know and i will delete the comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,rape accusations ruin mens lives though rare false rape accusations really do ruin mens liveseven after being acquitted why is it wrong to acknowledge this and strive for something better for everyone
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,men commit suicide more thing can we apply this to reddit
ShitRedditSays,removed,the fact that americans have to choose between a war criminal and a racist rapist sickens me to my core i understand if you live in a swing state but if you live somewhere like ny or california you have no excuse to vote for that war criminal hillary clinton whose campaign worked to make trump as big as he is httpsimgurcomaumtwg
ShitRedditSays,removed,same tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,well it is a fantasy film
ShitRedditSays,removed,trans people generally are not intersex
ShitRedditSays,removed,what do you say when someone asks you to go along with something that is hateful to you
ShitRedditSays,removed,there are plenty of situations where pretending is not acceptable
ShitRedditSays,removed,libertarians to the wall imo
ShitRedditSays,removed,i mean we can pretend that its not how it works but i meanthat is how it works we just allow it do to the history of the nation and the misdeeds of the past if you deny one person who is more qualified based on their skin color specifically due to their skin color that is very much racially motivated aa is very much racismsexism its just socially acceptable because or our past if you own a store for example and wish to deny service to someone because you dont like their hair color thats fine you have every right to if you own a store for example and wish to deny service to someone because you dont like their skin color thats illegal thats not fine you dont have any right to legally whats the difference there is no difference but one is ok and one isnt because of the history of the nation a store owner should have every right to deny service to anyone for any reason they want america is hilarious when it comes to this stuff
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a white man we are less punchy indeed
ShitRedditSays,removed,srs where science and definitions go to die
ShitRedditSays,removed,i am a poc and even to me what youve said sounds quite racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,thanks for the xpost we need to share the great knowledge and truth about our society
ShitRedditSays,removed,is anyone not sick of their shit by now
ShitRedditSays,removed,i love it mate low crime high trust societies producing high levels of prosperity and technological innovation
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol india was colonised for but has a much lower murder rate than ethiopia which was colonised for years even if you do blame colonialism youre admitting that poc immigrants will bring higher levels of violence and murder with them
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you ever been around any drunk girls
ShitRedditSays,removed,also can someone explain why that sign is racist i really dont know
ShitRedditSays,removed,we arent all like this pig fucker
ShitRedditSays,removed,dont forget missing a flight to see your dying mother ha such petty things
ShitRedditSays,removed,wheres your source that theyre letting emergency vehicles through i found an article two weeks ago that a dying kid had to be air lifted to get out of a blm demonstration
ShitRedditSays,removed,go to reddit gulag plox
ShitRedditSays,removed,go to reddit gulag plox
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is and always has been about journalism in game ethics
ShitRedditSays,removed,criticizing amy schumer isnt criticizing all nonmale comedians youre blatantly dishonest
ShitRedditSays,removed,you people are exactly what that throwaway line is lampooning though lol thats why it triggers you snowflakes its too close to home cue witty sarcastic joak posts while you cry into your cheetos xd
ShitRedditSays,removed,perhaps for a second different groups of gamergaters think its a bunch of different things
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont think theyre comparing the forum to genocide they saying the reason theyre shutting down the no mams sky sub is because people talked about how bad the game is if people talked about how bad nazi germany was on a nazi germany sub then that got shut down people would claim that theyre filtering public discussion to say that this person is comparing no mans sky to the nazis isnt really fair
ShitRedditSays,removed,i wish you could see the ages of the people that vote up on the good op vs those that vote up on the one that said keep going as shitty as it is i hope that those that vote on the one encouraging rape are just little kids that think its funny because hurr durr rape is funny and arent adults that are allowed to vote and drive cars
ShitRedditSays,removed,all the white folks i know condemn it we think it is totally fucked up and i think we all wonder how those their parents should have seen some signs of disturbing behavior beyond that what is the collective white community going to do have a protest that shit wouldnt do anything also you know people of all colors shoot each other right who cares if the reason is they are mentally ill or it is because of drugs or gangs murder is murder all people have a fucked up percentage in their populations flying a race flag just makes all the separate groups hate each other which leads to more violence
ShitRedditSays,removed,because this man right here httpimgurcomvqacmpk deserves to die because of his job right fuck you
ShitRedditSays,removed,you cant be peaceful and disruptive at the same time
ShitRedditSays,removed,theres hoods none of you ladies in this thread would walk through trust me keep talking on the internet tho lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry i said a tall latte please
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats the problem sounds about right
ShitRedditSays,removed,there was chant as well large number of tweets celebrating the dead cops with the and blm co founder about killing men and whites ignoring the large problematic element in the movement as a minor faction in the group is similar to police looking the other way to corruption in their ranks even if they themselves follow the rules and only leads further away from any sort of peaceful solution both groups are responsible for the current violence
ShitRedditSays,removed,well they arent good
ShitRedditSays,removed,no there arent women good enough to get onto teams most of the time
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok dont get me wrong i actually only came here because this is the only sane place when it comes to cops but how does what they do help the cause there needs to be clear and stated goals or nothing will ever happen the police departments arent officially racist they also just overall horrible pretty much everywhere like it doesnt get anything done i mean thats most leftist ideologies but still
ShitRedditSays,removed,whats a women then
ShitRedditSays,removed,just give blm pigs in blankets a search on youtube
ShitRedditSays,removed,abbreviating that word doesnt make it any less racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,well theyre not wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,news article with deadlinks and almost no sources compare video evidence
ShitRedditSays,removed,thomas moore jesus
ShitRedditSays,removed,suspicion is not probable cause i dont get why you people dont understand that
ShitRedditSays,removed,we are in a war with islamic fundamentalism and islam of course i would they fall under enemies of the state and pursuant to both the patriot act and the renewed ndaa they have no rights to due process
ShitRedditSays,removed,gender isnt entirely social otherwise medical transition wouldnt entirely work
ShitRedditSays,removed,you do know most nazis believed a lot of white people were subhuman too
ShitRedditSays,removed,that was a really isolated situation and a comparison no one involved made
ShitRedditSays,removed,anyone defending hyugas actions because of his state is wrong plain and simple being drunk is never an excuse for your actions ever despite that fact however you can defend hyuga as a person yes he chose to get drunk yes in his inebriated state he did molest another person does this make his actions bad definitely does this make him a bad person no he was drunk and he has profusely apologized along with submitting himself to all punishment and hate he has received there are no signs that he will do something like this again but this one isolated experience he did a bad thing but that doesnt make him a bad person
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is true that there is a higher standard deviation in iq among men than among women whatever you want to take away from that i dont know but it is true
ShitRedditSays,removed,the story is a bunch if people with letters on their shirts were making different words one of the girls had a black boyfriend the boyfriend told her they should spell out nigger they then got a group together spelled it out and someone not the boyfriend took the picture and posted it
ShitRedditSays,removed,from the rest of the comments it looks like people thought he was just being ironic and upvoted him because of his name thinking he was a novelty account down below people are flaming him and he is being downvoted into oblivion at least i have some faith in humanity restored
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh my god this subreddit is disgusting you guys keep your out of context strawman shit im out
ShitRedditSays,removed,as a childless single man who masturbateswere not all trump supporters
ShitRedditSays,removed,that guy represents whats wrong with islam but he isnt the totality of islam basically malala cancels this guy and all the other ones like him out all by herself because shes magic
ShitRedditSays,removed,lmao jesus comparing people to elementary kids while being this salty
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey im honored you guys are hopelessly wrong about islam but right about other stuff particularly the pedophilia on reddit thanks for the recognition you may delete this comment now and ban me
ShitRedditSays,removed,at least until the next fashionable thing arrives
ShitRedditSays,removed,ok
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think thats interesting because while hamilton is being played by a poc hamilton was white so while yes it would be nice to have hamilton played by poc im not sure how racist it would be for eminem to play him if you have a different viewpoint id love to hear your explanation
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont agree with this at all and i find it odd how readily you dissociate culture and religion muslims constantly contradict each other because there doesnt exist a single interpretation of islamic beliefs and laws and there never will its impossible to deduce a pefect interpretation of axioms and laws as poorly formed as they are within islam unless you actually believe in their god you cant have any other interpretation really the reality is women are persecuted and treated horribly in many muslim societies and arguing that only koranists of one particular type are the only true scotsman is a no go
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree that he spends a lot of time lately playing up to the alt right boyz and by god has he said and done some questionable shit however in this case is he really that wrong about the subject of the video i found it very difficult to take zarna joshi seriously and his point about her asking for donations compared to the other guy asking people to donate to a battered womans shelter kind of struck a nerve with me at first i thought it was really easy and unfair to put zarna joshi on blast no matter how silly she was in the original video because it perpetuated an unhelpful false narrative about feminism and sjws but since her response video i think shes just well for lack of a better wordphrasing an obnoxious idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,i reported someones comment in rpolitics saying they would only vote for hillary if bernie was vpand a doctor told them that hillary would be having a stroke very soon i wonder if it will actually be taken down 🤔 its fine to despise her but i dont think its cool to hope someone has a hypothetical medical emergency
ShitRedditSays,removed,why dont you just leave reddit seems like itd be a much more productive use of your time imzy seems like a much better platform and it wont grow unless people use it
ShitRedditSays,removed,actually after reading a lot of the responses my annoyance isnt with trans issues so much as it is toward the far left who cant seem to accept that someone may not be in line with their ideology so rather than have a real discussion to try and see why i have such an opinion or to see if or how im misinformed you would rather just look down on people and adopt a smug attitude i never said i totally care about trans people i believing in live and let live that dont mean people cant get on my nerves from time to time oh im annoyed by someones attitude that definitely means im a transphobic racist whatever else you think is bad thats the only explanation ok pal
ShitRedditSays,removed,because its a joke and usually people dont take jokes to heart especially on the internet where there is no target for the joke
ShitRedditSays,removed,generalizing people based on their race theres a word for that justifying violence destruction of public property and blocking emergency vehicles
ShitRedditSays,removed,terrorism the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of political aims explain to me how blm doesnt fit the definition of terrorism
ShitRedditSays,removed,these fucking dogs threaten us constantly in reply to on he is actively fighting a proposal in congress to have the full information declassified he is worried about the fallout and threats the saudis have made at utc everynightiwatch wrote threats the saudis have made exactly these fucking dogs threaten us constantly the latest threat is that if we sue them theyll divest from the us obamas visit to ksa was a shitshow i think that should have provoked an aggressive response im flabbergasted about all this fucking bullshit they get away with on a global scale including funding us enemies this whole awful relationship between ksa and the us is based upon a agreement from the bush family supported by nixonkissinger i think if clinton gets into office than that agreement continues if sanders or trump gets into office then this shit will finally end
ShitRedditSays,removed,the last recorded lynching in the us was in
ShitRedditSays,removed,any mods in here to get in touch with no one is answering back
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you really arguing that blm doesnt use violence and intimidation theres literally hundreds of examples of them doing just that
ShitRedditSays,removed,it doesnt seem particularly fair to characterize white political expression as lynchings when theres only been two documented lynchings in the past years if those sorts of generalizations are fair game in your book i certainly hope youre ready for some nasty ones to be made about muslims
ShitRedditSays,removed,the examples are from video evidence of people being violent shouting black lives matter this is relevant to the conversation you cant refute my arguments so you resort to an attack on something else i said in a different sub on a different day
ShitRedditSays,removed,theyre using a stereotype to make a joke all types of stereotypes are used to make all different types of jokes lighten up
ShitRedditSays,removed,take your pick
ShitRedditSays,removed,to say that theres no violence or intimidation in any of those videos is asinine i have different opinions than you obviously i must be fucking retarded because you are as we all know infallible
ShitRedditSays,removed,yep theyre all alex jones youtube videos you havent created any straw men you havent committed any logical fallacies the man behind the camera is making all those blm protesters be violent they are obviously being forced into terrorism by the mere presence of a camera the violent anytrump protests in chicago werent violent because reasons the violation of personal freedoms and violence during the mizzou protests werent violent disturbing classes at a college while chanting black lives matter and threatening people with violence and cursing at people isnt intimidation blm and any group of minorities in general can do no wrong tldr minorities are infallible and incapable of wrongdoing
ShitRedditSays,removed,because we all know that libertarians are retarded nazis s im not a libertarian im libertarian leaning because authoritarianism has never worked and will never work also thanks for calling me nameslike a lot of people here thats sure to help your argument and show just how great progressivism is
ShitRedditSays,removed,you could leave
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dunno what about calling someone a dick in regards to them being jerks or aggressively obnoxious i dunno like the word cunt it seems to boil down to personal tastes im of the opinion that an insult is only as gendered as we perceive it to be but im also from a language that uses masculinefeminine words so maybe were a bit more used to it i can imagine for english speakers maybe suddenly using a word that is feminine or masculine carries a lot more weight and subtle meaning i think the discussion about gendered insults is so interesting and i really do believe there is an interesting conversation to be had there
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont see how this comment is a problem they clearly mean it in jest
ShitRedditSays,removed,isnt what youve just said the definition of sexism though to apply and assume the same horrifying behaviours from a section of a demographic with its whole
ShitRedditSays,removed,because women are bitches bro all of them aaaaallllll of them fuck bitches get money bro
ShitRedditSays,removed,you girls need to grow some balls man up quit having pussies then be arrested for using the wrong bathroom
ShitRedditSays,removed,ferguson baltimore attack on trumps rally in chicago there are many many examples odd coordinated funded planned violence
ShitRedditSays,removed,because its funny god you people have no sense of humor
ShitRedditSays,removed,rioting isnt protesting burning buildings attacking innocent people and destroying communities isnt protesting
ShitRedditSays,removed,because nobody gives a flying fuck about your feelings you dumb fucking cunt why dont you go back to your marxistcommunist kike community college professor and tell him you were triggered and ask him to tell you how to think i can only hope that trump is indeed adolf hitler i will gladly round you and your kind up arrest you and throw you in a concentration camp you do realize that russia might be a better country for you to live in
ShitRedditSays,removed,sticks and stones may break my bones but words will cripple my unstable and heavily dependent level of self worth get over yourselves
ShitRedditSays,removed,holy shit fucking hilarious showing this and telling all my friends the joke lmfao
ShitRedditSays,removed,tru

ShitRedditSays,removed,lol youre so sad and butthurt because somebody made a joke you dont like like this whole sub is do sad and butthurt all the fucking time because of whatever shitposts you guys dig up like its a significant find
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is your coping mechanism usernames
ShitRedditSays,removed,excuse me what the fuck are you talking about is this a meme from here
ShitRedditSays,removed,the apa used to classify homosexuality as an illness as well clearly whats an illness is heavily influenced by cultural trends but good job taking the apa as gospel lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,if yall stopped being such little shits and brought your cops some donuts your community might be just a tad better in reply to deluxeflame on same for me in maryland i asked how much i owed him he said a nice dinner dont worry bout it son at utc wrote what you do owe him is to ask him which precinct hes out of and bring a box or two of donuts by with a thank you note edit yeah if you were shouting fuck da police yesterday and show up with a box of donuts today then yes any police officer worth their weight in salt would question that and probably throw it out however if they came out and did a service for you which you were thankful for and went above and beyond in thanking them ie bring then donuts or something then i highly doubt your efforts are going to go to waste having friends and family in departments large and small ive never heardseen of them throwing out a token of gratitude from a wellmeaning citizen yes ive done it and yes it worked maybe if yall stopped being such little shits and brought your cops some donuts your community might be just a tad better httpiimgurcomooemboxpng

ShitRedditSays,removed,im fat and i never tell anyone im fat what a douchebag seriously reddit is full of stupid ppl lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow i know its disgusting and crude i cant believe he did that thats so bad wow
ShitRedditSays,removed,blm is super important to todays society i hate that people try and label them all these disgusting perverted bigotted things blm has helped millions of people get their university degrees and most have gone on to accomplish really good things like doing womens studies and contributing to beauty of all sizes movements gees reddit says some dumb stuff hey lollllllllllllll
ShitRedditSays,removed,oh my gosh preach it brother this is exactly what theyre all like every single one of those disgusting bigots
ShitRedditSays,removed,sorry if im writing here but are mods inactive or gone
ShitRedditSays,removed,you never go full red pill
ShitRedditSays,removed,are you fucked i never said anything near this you idiot
ShitRedditSays,removed,clearly none of you have been to india or have indian parents haggling and bartering is a big part of indian culture although moreso in the mainland than in the states i think that is what he was trying to get at though tact is unknown to some ppl
ShitRedditSays,removed,i lold seriously why is this here
ShitRedditSays,removed,every girl in the thread just realized youre right
ShitRedditSays,removed,probably just wanted to see if she was worth the grand
ShitRedditSays,removed,is being a redditor a mental illness
ShitRedditSays,removed,dr mchugh
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont really see a problem with this
ShitRedditSays,removed,d e s i g n a t e d s h i t t i n g s t r e e t s e s i g n a t e d s h i t t i n g s t r e e t s
ShitRedditSays,removed,if refugees arent all terrorists then why are all the terrorists in europe refugees smug
ShitRedditSays,removed,waityou think thats scientifically innacurate
ShitRedditSays,removed,the problem is that women is corrupt
ShitRedditSays,removed,mine is so at least its cancelled outright
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats a terrible article obviously theres going to be more white criminals than black criminals in the united states given that more than of the us population is composed of caucasians what is more important is the rate of violence theres almost as many black murderers as white murderers despite the fact that there are more white people than black people in the us it is in fact true that rates of violence are significantly greater in black american populations than any other american racial demographic
ShitRedditSays,removed,source
ShitRedditSays,removed,i got banned from renoughtrumpspam and rthedonald for i understand why the trump people banned me i was totally trolling them ets banned me just for engaging i pointed this out to ets and got the ban lifted but i dont like getting autobanned for any kind of interacting with opposing points of view
ShitRedditSays,removed,source go to page
ShitRedditSays,removed,today you learned
ShitRedditSays,removed,liberals love context because they can use it to talk their way out of factual data and off into the beaten path that is their personal ideology where they are always right
ShitRedditSays,removed,i really dont see whats wrong with this one
ShitRedditSays,removed,rgaming rpcmasterrace rleagueoflegends oh fuck off loser get your eugenics shit somewhere else
ShitRedditSays,removed,i get what youre doing and i agree you cant just group a class of people and suggest theyre the problem people of a specific group arent inherently prone to commit a certain act of violence or a crime but all i was doing was specifically targeting the false idea that blacks are more frequently targeted by police when the data shows that they are in fact committing more crime the topic of the reasons why or how to solve it is an entirely different discussion which is apparently what youre now passively agressivly trying to push into because you dont like the fact that i pointed out facts
ShitRedditSays,removed,say what you will about trump but you can hardly call him corrupt right now
ShitRedditSays,removed,hurr durr hurr in dis tred da wumun do caraaaaaaaaaaazy ting den da man do calm cool n rational ting he also has thundercock bt dubbs den da filthy neckos of reddit all congradulate da man for being cool n insult da womun for being crazy n karma iz to be had for all hurr durr hurr
ShitRedditSays,removed,hurr durr hurr muh child will die but now me gets full year of da reddit guld wuz good day hurr durr hurr
ShitRedditSays,removed,just because they post in rthedonald doesnt mean they agree with how the sub is ran or even posters in the sub people are saying that auto bans from all of those subs are asinine
ShitRedditSays,removed,but a lot of these people arent committing hate speech isnt there a danger of blanketing everyone that disagrees with you and stifling conversation
ShitRedditSays,removed,white people dont even have homelands
ShitRedditSays,removed,but well just welcome him with open arms
ShitRedditSays,removed,looks like were brigading ourselves again
ShitRedditSays,removed,this statistic specifically is talking about homicide not jaywalking
ShitRedditSays,removed,tbh i often see posts from women who are sick of the expectation that they should bear children and not that many about hating women sorry for breaking the jerk
ShitRedditSays,removed,i agree that theres something wrong with the black communityand im black
ShitRedditSays,removed,youryoure is more orthography than grammar isnt it spelling isnt grammar grammar is the structure of a language
ShitRedditSays,removed,alpha male cock is stronger than lesbianism any alpha male will know this and keep trying after a woman tells him shes gay
ShitRedditSays,removed,thats pretty hilarious
ShitRedditSays,removed,the joke isnt about autistic people its about the genji stereotype
ShitRedditSays,removed,screeching in a manner of someone having an autistic breakdown
ShitRedditSays,removed,because its a joke making an asian joke doesnt automatically make you a racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,if youre really going to act like a joke about autism is stripping you of your humanity than might i suggest a httpswwwtumblrcom
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is hilariously ironic
ShitRedditSays,removed,a small part of me wishes more men would get raped so men might see themselves as potential rape victims instead of potential false accusation victims
ShitRedditSays,removed,the legal protection of that year old ends on her birthday but youre still a goddamn creep if you fap to it
ShitRedditSays,removed,you cant fight for a spork and the idea that spoons and forks are a social construct
ShitRedditSays,removed,its projection hatred disagreeing
ShitRedditSays,removed,calling out innocuous jokes does no favours for your cause it just makes people more irritated with you thats why no one likes srs
ShitRedditSays,removed,i disagree but lets give you that point it still does you no favours does it the way srs reacts to any of these jokes is exactly why the jokes are made in the first place
ShitRedditSays,removed,welcome to playing as a girl in a moba enjoy your stay and your rape threats
ShitRedditSays,removed,i for one am sick of this hitler is a bad person circlejerk s
ShitRedditSays,removed,i dont want to have sex with redditors but im not going to call you a rapist if i find out you have an account
ShitRedditSays,removed,its a space for expressing frustration at ignorant and hateful attitudes which reddit is teeming with so what youre saying is srs is no better than the rest of reddit but thats the whole irony of this sub people make jokes about it because of the way it is then this sub does the typical thing and cries about reddit making typical jokes reddit sees this finds it stupid and makes a joke about it rinse and repeat meanwhile someone like me will call this out and get told the jokes reinforce some bad things about gnc people when you explain that this sub doesnt exactly help the gnc cause either you say its not meant to win people over so basically you cause the jokes and perpetuate the jokes against gnc people all in one
ShitRedditSays,removed,pedos should be castrated tbh
ShitRedditSays,removed,rapes no laughing matter unless youre raping a clown
ShitRedditSays,removed,ronda rousey needs to make a blackedcom video
ShitRedditSays,removed,only a white kid would act like that
ShitRedditSays,removed,there is a saying and im paraphrasing if everyone is an asshole you are the asshole
ShitRedditSays,removed,why would that determine if its a good game or not news flash theres shitty people in this world some are going to like things you like if you like the game a bunch of assholes shouldnt sway your opinion on the game
ShitRedditSays,removed,people discussing important and difficult topics is shit you being butthurt that other people have different oppinions is pathetic but yeah crawling back into your circlejerk safespace will help a lot go on then
ShitRedditSays,removed,except they are
ShitRedditSays,removed,if the post is wrong then the original poster misunderstands the definition of mental illness transphobia is neither explicit or implicit in his post the poster expresses no emotions regarding transgenders i feel like if this is a misunderstanding of what a mental illness is the right response is to correct that misunderstanding accusing someone like this of transphobia is not helpful to anyone one of the responses to the quoted post this is what the aperican psychological assossiation the biggest association of psychologists with members with scientific credentials has to say on gender dysphoria being a mental illness this is the organization that has the authority to declare something a mental illness is being transgender a mental illness a psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder for these individuals the significant problem is finding affordable resources such as counseling hormone therapy medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination many other obstacles may lead to distress including a lack of acceptance within society direct or indirect experiences with discrimination or assault these experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons this is the end of the story psychologists are the ones who get to declare something a mental disorder or not also transgender people dont suffer any significant disability while living as the gender their body accepts without abusive parents transgender people wouldnt be disabled at all this is a helpful response and one that accepts the poster for what heshe seems taking them simply on the basis of this post to be someone who is factually confused if you wanted to do that you could have instead you threw the transphobe word out there
ShitRedditSays,removed,both are equally racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,and how is he wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,i think his the top comment point was and he edited saying illness was wrong but disorder would be better that there is stigma around mental disorders being necessarily bad andor harmful hes saying that that obviously is not the case as with transgender individuals many autistic individuals etc
ShitRedditSays,removed,have you heard of virpedorg its a group for pedophiles who recognize what thru are but have no wish to harm children pedophiles dont choose to be pedophiles but they do choose whether or not to act on their urges
ShitRedditSays,removed,a pedophile is a pedophile whether or not they actually engage in molestation the point was that there are pedophiles who abstain and have no desire to hurt children
ShitRedditSays,removed,well i mean when you do graduate from your safe spaces in college it really is going to be a totally unpleasant surprise for you good luck
ShitRedditSays,removed,except they are
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow someone presents an inconvenient viewpoint to you and they become an asshole you sound like a calm reasonable lovely human being i definitely want to spend time with people like you to learn your views as you shout them at me and stuff them down my throat
ShitRedditSays,removed,hey im sure the mods are trying as hard as they can to stifle the thousands of people who disagree with the majority of shit opinions expressed in this sub
ShitRedditSays,removed,httpswwwredditcomrshitredditsays fixed the last link for ya
ShitRedditSays,removed,true
ShitRedditSays,removed,nothing as adorable as complaining about downvotes especially on a sub famous for censorship and angry circlejerking maybe that should tell you how many people dont think your obnoxiousness is appropriate
ShitRedditSays,removed,true some pedophiles doubtless need treatment to help themselves i have no idea of the percentages but i wouldnt think its all of them youre not wrong though
ShitRedditSays,removed,why is everyone laughing at his baseless facts without linking a source that proves hes wrong wouldnt that be a better way to deal with people visiting this sub from his comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,except that gender dysphoria is classified as a mental illness thats a pretty irrefutable fact
ShitRedditSays,removed,my point was that i thought the comment link in the op was intimating pretty much what i said above the comment linked isnt shitting or intending to shit on on homosexual people at all the whole point was that mental illness of which i want to be clear that i dont think illness is the correct word to use here at all isnt necessarily or inherently bad at least thats what i took from the comment
ShitRedditSays,removed,it is negative its a disorder who would want to feel like they were born into the wrong body nobody nobody would
ShitRedditSays,removed,so everyone whos saying that the only people who think gender dysphoria are talking out of their ass and have no psychiatric basis what qualifications do you have can someone please explain to me how an all encompassing sense of unease and the feeling of being in the wrong body is not a mental disorder you literally have to change the definition of what mental disorder means for it to not be one i think the reason everyones up in arms about this is because of a negative connotation of what mental disorder means which is ignorant
ShitRedditSays,removed,honestly im not sure i found it years ago i just remember it whenever people mention all pedos are bad i probably found it wanting to know whether or not all pedophiles were bad but honestly not sure
ShitRedditSays,removed,i didnt call vocal vegans assholes i called assholes assholes people who view you as literally hitler for eating meat im perfectly fine with someone wanting to talk to me about why i should eat less or no meat im even fine with it at the dinner table im not okay with people who swear at me and try to show me pictures of factory farms and shit and generally make veganism their sole defining trait its irritating as fuck its also irritating when they bitch about people taking insulin because it comes from animals i wasnt talking about you being hostile youre being quite civil im getting downvoted to fuck with no explanation or attempt at discussion though
ShitRedditSays,removed,honest questionif someone is born with a penis but for their entire life they knew they should have been born with female genitalia and do not feel comfortable at all in their own skin how is that not some sort of illness or disorder if someone felt uncomfortable having an arm so much so they wanted it amputated to feel complete apotemnophilia is that not a mental illness
ShitRedditSays,removed,you mean homophilia apologist and pedophiliaphobia
ShitRedditSays,removed,black supremacy would have killed tens of millions of people if they only had the power to do so dont fool yourself
ShitRedditSays,removed,why i mean is anyone without ptsd actually triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,
ShitRedditSays,removed,im not going to debate what is right or wrong i think homosexuality and pedophilia are similar when someone behave out of the norm or have some sort of quirk that person will either be considered eccentric or ill it all depend of the norm of the culture the majority of what is called mental illness are but social constructs
ShitRedditSays,removed,telling me to fuck off doesnt answer my question
ShitRedditSays,removed,no reddit isnt and its disgusting really i cant believe in were still arguing about if homosexuality isnt the best thing ever disgusting anyone that isnt liberal is just a cancr on soecietiy
ShitRedditSays,removed,hahahahaha lets get em boys arm the troops lets brigade and downvote them lol theyll be all like oh nooo my comment was downvoted hahahaha thatll show em
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant believe people hate trans people wow trans people are heroes and give people people to look up to and stuff and this guy was clearl making fun of them disgusting
ShitRedditSays,removed,i cant believe theyd say indians are cheap indians are really oppressed and have hard lives because of the oppression and then they come on the internet to escape all the oppression and you know whats waiting there for specifically htem on the internet mean commentslike really really mean comments insinuating that theyre cheap like wow oh my gosh wow thats disgusting if only there was a group of people to downvote the comments that would demonstrate just how evil and wrong and mean it is
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow in this day and age they used the word retarded thats disgusting ugh i cant believe it
ShitRedditSays,removed,wow generalising that ugandas are nice is pretty friggen racist
ShitRedditSays,removed,i remember my friend saying to me if a psych patient believe he was a lion or an animal of some sort theyd say hes crazy but if a man believes hes a womn hes sane and hero he really was disgusting and oh my gosh so disgusting and then we were on the internet this oen time and i became offended
ShitRedditSays,removed,he is not wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,this is totally correct
ShitRedditSays,removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,removed,about a picture of a group of children that look to be around eight they had a threesome afterwards for sure they played doctor together afterwards for sure in reply to lordhayati on httpiimgurcomedloheagif at utc therealchungis wrote they had a threesome afterwards for sure
ShitRedditSays,removed,were you triggered
ShitRedditSays,removed,mental disorder is actually the more accurate way of stating mental illness since illness has more negative and plain inaccurate connotations in relation to what it was used to describe so autism is technically a mental disorder gender dysphoria is also categorized as a mental disorder this is mainly due to the fact that without treatmenttransitioning people suffering from it show many of symptoms of a mental disorder it creates suffering and an impaired ability to function in ordinary life while also not being developmentally typical however gender dysphoria does not affect all transgender people only those that heavily suffer from their gender identity issues so being transgender is technically not a mental illness its just that many people that are transgender suffer from gender dysphoria hence why both the op quoted and srs are both half right
ShitRedditSays,removed,you are literally your body that is objective reality
ShitRedditSays,removed,look at the replies stop being s solly billy
ShitRedditSays,removed,you think unenacted pedophilia is wrong the original poster is wrong but not because paedophilia and homosexuality are very different things he is wrong because homosexuality isnt an illness your statement might be more offensive than his at least he is making it clear that homosexuality isnt wrong
ShitRedditSays,removed,reddit had to toss a coin between its hatred for blacks and its hatred for women
ShitRedditSays,removed,well did they
ShitRedditSays,removed,pat has a penis and vagina
ShitRedditSays,removed,as someone who has been here under an hour and already hates this fucking subreddit why the fuck is the benign and witty rpolandball a low hanging fruit
ShitRedditSays,removed,pasty yeah that sounds kind of like body shaming to me lets mock their ideas not their appearance
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is true though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ethics in video game journalism is just a shitty facade to harass women lgbt folks and poc at utc replied to theyre pretty much sensitive to any thing that requires them to face reality you mean like the reality that ethics in video game journalism is just a shitty facade to harass women lgbt folks and poc white cishet men arent the most oppressed group and that reverse isms arent actual things or are we talking about the reality that there are numerous cultures that have more than two genders and that people identifying outside the binary is just something you dont want to understand reddituers make excellent projectors better than any you can find at your local imax cinema httpiimgurcomjhivaqdpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,less than five percent of rape charges ever result in convictions you stupid fucks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,believing rape victims is literally fascism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the sub for women everyone good job reddit you shit stain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on redditcom eye witness testimony is not evidence especially if its the testimony of a woman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the comment was replying to a quote i am tired of people talking to me like i won some sort of rape lottery because the legal system did what it is supposed to do fantastic they lack the awareness to understand they did exactly what was described in the quote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,false rape accusations occur more than actual rapes reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is not what happens in dictatorships in dictatorships youre raped by the military and party leaders and you have no recourse the police arent even on your side clearly this is much different than the us status quo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,absolutely sickening i hope reddit gets sued one day for their role in enabling rape by giving rapists a safe space
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres nothing to say it wasnt consensual at the time winning a rape case is hard and it complete ruins the accused persons life are you just going to make a rape claim an instant conviction thats what happens in dictatorships in reply to xxruruxx on i wish this for the us i am tired of people talking to me like i won some sort of rape lottery because the legal system did what it is supposed to do mic drop at utc kalarianreborn wrote the problem is its hard for the court system to do what its supposed to the purpose of court is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime occurred with physical evidence most of the time i think rape is pretty hard to prove sometimes in many cases the victim showers and washes the evidence off or the rape doesnt leave damage or scars that can be seen and that sucks so much for the victim because it puts them in a bad place the burden of proof is always on the accuser to prove something happened not on the accused to prove it didnt but sometimes you literally cant prove it with physical evidence you are essentially asking the court to convict a person based solely on testimony of another person this is assuming case with no evidence or witnesses like if a woman was forced to blow a guy and no one saw if she comes forward days later all of the evidence is gone you are going to court with literally evidence without footage or witnesses that the event happened even if it did happen theres nothing to say it wasnt consensual at the time so now its just a game of hesaidshesaid rape cases are no different than any other case that boils down to hesaidshesaid the only way to win is to attack your opponent and make them look like they are more likely to be lying than you are so yeah winning a rape case is hard and it complete ruins the accused persons life so the court better be damned sure that he did it despite having no evidence as much as it sucks what are you going to do are you just going to make a rape claim an instant conviction thats what happens in dictatorships
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit doesnt belive in rape so every rape accusation is false to them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure this rapist got convicted but can we all please talk about a hypothetical case i just pulled out of my ass where it was all a misunderstanding i mean theres a reason why what about the menz is in the bill of rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly are false accusations checkmate feminazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember that time when you listened to the victim in a rape case and then big brother knocked on your door and took over the country
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean rape is fucking awful and rapists should absolutely rot in jail but i feel like your statement is a little problematic as it tells any rape victim reading it that their life is ruined which is not a great way to help them recover and move past the traumatizing event
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbf in reality eyewitness testimony should be viewed as exceedingly dubious in general because there is so much evidence that memory is unreliable and can easily be manipulated even if no one has malicious intent simply asking how fast a car was going when a car hit a person or when it plowed through a person will cause a big difference in how people remember the event
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dictatorship anything redditers disagree with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont happen because muh freeze peaches
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yea he is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hang on its a bit more than seeing a car accident its claiming that an awful violent crime happened to you vs it didnt at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes im assuming its not a stranger rape which the vast majority of rapes are not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you need to be taught a lesson on bens boardbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the post were all discussing is about rape how is crime in general relevant i agree about witnesses to crimes in general
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we also upvote shitposts if they make us laugh this post is removed because it goes in rsrsmeta or rsrsquestions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those are called lmbo posts basically really mad mad redditors tried to make self posts calling out srs for various eeeevils such as being feminists and talking about shit redditors say those are pretty funny to us so we usually flair them and approve them if you look in the comments they are all basically lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah sorry wasnt aware those two existed ill post it there instead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so this is a profeminism subreddit i still dont get it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep read the sidebar its a circlejerk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah right im in the phone version of reddit so sorry i had to ask aha ill take a look on my pc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,many of these people are forgetting that this kind of sentiment led to the roma being killed en masse as part of the holocaust
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so whats all that talk about fascism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know what any of this means
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fucking hate my country and the way of its people find this video funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats the good comment it says that its fascist to approve of the mistreatment of these people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ho visto innumerevoli volte zingare piagnucolare quando venivano pescate a rubare ed era palese che facessero sceneggiate napoletane la cosa che mi ha colpito di più però è stata una volta che la polizia ha arrestato una zingara beccata a rubare e laveva messa in macchina questa ha iniziato a tirar testate contro i vetri per autolesionarsi e poi accusare i poliziotti di violenze non ho la minima fiducia di queste persone se vogliono avere la mia comprensione se la devono guadagnare ive many times seen gypsies whining when they get caught stealing and its clear that they were making a big show the thing that got me the most though was a time when the police arrested a gypsy woman caught stealing and they had put her in their car she started to beat her head against the windows to hurt herself and accuse the police of violence i dont trust these people in the least if they want my compassion they have to earn it notare come tommasi insista particolarmente sulletnia rom delle povere vittime ma come le persone non andavano giudicate sulla base delle loro azioni e basta che generalizzare e classificare è sbagliato e sul gesto dei subumani italiani perché non è clima di odio se è verso gli italiani logico no nellepoca dei fatti alternativi e di trump tommasi è sempre allavanguardia le zingare stavano cercando cibo nella zona resi ovvero i prodotti in garanzia da far tornare alle aziende per il rimborso che io sappia il cibo non viene rimborsato omettere particolari del video che sono scomodi alla narrazione la zingare che si morde la mano laltra che continua a raccattare roba censura di chi gli fa notare che sta mentendo notice how tommasi insists particularly on romani being an ethnicity of poor victims but how shouldnt people be judged on their actions and nothing else isnt generalizing wrong and on the gestures of the subhuman italians because it isnt hate if its against italians logical right in the time of alternative facts and trump tommasi is always at the vanguard the gypsies were looking for food in the returning area that is the products they could return to the store for money i know food doesnt get reimbursed ignoring the details of the video inconvenient for the narrative the gypsy that bites her hand the other one that keeps picking up stuff censuring those who make him notice what hes assuming i dont want to keep translating thesei feel kinda sick
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,qua la mano fratello condivido al
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes but it is what happens when people are forcibly excluded often with violence from every level of society for more then years
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you consult on that world of darkness splatbook or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you really are a neonazi are you ohhh boy lets look at your history says it only results in a quagmire because we are trying to follow silly arbitrary rules while waging war we create the conditions for an insurgency to survive coin used to be done by simple collective punishment so the problem is that the obama administration was not flagrantly violating human rights we are already well armed and ready to crush the left whenever the opportunity presents itself bring it look at those evil violent lieberals trying to suppress all dissent oh no its the conservatives are threatening violence the us is going to be violating human rights a lot in the next years so we leave early that is exactly what i voted for okay its confirmed you have no sense of human decency whatsoever you should never consider starving people to death as a solution to anything except over population yep to be fair to both sides god doesnt actually exist and the book is just judaeo christian fanfic created for political purpose reading too much into it is just silly i feel the euphoria entering me already guess youve been reading too much sam harris and are taking his utilitarian philosophy to its logical conclusion you know its ironic how in religulous bill maher concludes by saying that religious people running nucleararmed states is the greatest existential threat to humanity but his friends little thought experiment about iran acquiring nuclear weapons proves that the latter should never be allowed anywhere near any sort of weapon of mass destruction for the reference i am referring to the thought experiment where sam advocates for a nuclear first strike as soon as iran possesses any nuclear weapon like how an overzealous inquisitor from orders an exterminatus onto any planet with as much as a wiff of chaos infestation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hope youre okay friend i guess literal garbage is more important than people these days
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill keep it up then people need to know whats being said io giudico normale trattenere in qualsiasi modo mi sia possibile una persona che sta compiendo un reato per attendere larrivo delle forze dellordine deridere e filmare è indubitabilmente un gesto di superficialità che mi fa passare dalla parte del torto però per favore ragazzi non parliamo di tortura mi pare di tornare a settimane fa ai giorni in cui bellofigo trollava con le sue risposte a cazzo la gente qui cè una zingara che trolla molti di voi con le sue urla a cazzo ve lo dico lo fanno ogni volta che vengono beccate con le mani nel sacco per spaventare confondere e buttare tutto in caciara attenti a tendere la mano a questi paraculi si mi dispiace doverli tutti raggruppare sotto una categoria sa di razzista e generalizzare è sbagliato ma per la maggior parte di loro purtroppo funziona perché per loro siete solo poveri scemi da sfruttare per passarla liscia ecco dovè e comè che quelle urla funzionano per quanto riguarda chi parla di fascisti mi ricorda chi invece in altri anni evocava i comunisti ragazzi è molto semplice adottare sistemi manichei per giudicare ma la realtà è più complessa e spesso più noiosa di come la si vorrebbe discutere qui cè poco da dire zingare trattenute fino allarrivo delle forze dellordine giusto zingare riprese derise e sbeffeggiate sbagliato tutto il resto sono chiacchiere i think it is normal to hold a person who is committing a crime by any means necessary while i wait for law enforcement to arrive mocking and filming is undoubtedly a sign of superficiality that puts me in the wrong but guys we cant call this torture this reminds me of a few weeks ago when bellofigo was trolling people with his random responses this is a gypsy trolling a lot of you with her pointless screams im telling you they do it whenever they are caught red handed to scare confuse and distract be careful when giving these parasites a hand yes i dont like grouping them all together like that it seems racist and generalizing is wrong but unfortunately it works for them because to them you are just suckers to be taken advantage of and that is what those screams are supposed to do as far as people talking about fascists is concerned i remember that in a different time people would be talking about communists it is very simple to use balanced systems to judge but reality is more complicated and often more annoying than we would like to admit there is really little to say here gypsies being held until law enforcement arrive right gypsies being mocked and humiliated wrong the rest is just chatter i sinti sono unetnia che francamente ha valori che non condivido nella cultura occidentale la bugia è una cosa cattiva per loro è normale conversazione nella cultura occidentale la proprietà altrui è da rispettare per loro rubare non è poi così grave ciò detto il fascismo di gente che non conosce la fame e dà le colpe dei propri insuccessi agli immigrati il fascismo di gente che trova normale rapire torturare deridere pubblicamente una donna di mezza età che ruba dallimmondizia cioè dagli scarti che nessuno vuole e quindi senza proprietà il fascismo di gente che trova bello condividere con altri su internet le gesta di tale maschia virilità è tipico di chi non solo non ha mai conosciuto la fame che nel ci sta fortunatamente ma di chi ha perso ogni capacità intellettiva per immaginarsela il fascismo è labolizione programmatica e sistematica di ogni capacità dimmaginazione the sinti part of the roma people are an ethnicity that hold values that frankly i dont share in western culture lies are a looked down on but for them its normal conversation in western culture the property of others is to be respected for them theft isnt so bad that being said the fascism of people that dont know hunger and blame their own failures on immigrants the fascism of people that normalize rape torture public humiliation a middleaged woman that steals from waste ie from trash that no one wants and is therefore unowned the fascism of people that like sharing online these acts of masculinity is typical of not only people that dont know hunger that fortunately are around in but of people that have lost all intellectual capacity to imagine it fascism is the systematic and programmatic abolition of every capacity for imagination reading shit like this makes me really ashamed to be italian
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quello che mi dà più fastidio è la gente che si proclama progressista quando non lo è neanche alla lontana quegli studenti universitari pronti a difendere a spada tratta il comunismo ma che nello stesso tempo spalano misoginia e razzismo a destra e a manca dimostrando unipocrisia mostruosa da gente che non sa pensare a meno che non si tenga loro la mano
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh dont get me wrong im very familiar with the history of my ancestors and the completely opposed levels of appropriation and integration weve faced high appropriation from things like the original bohemian movement minimal integration at best the difference is and it is a more nuanced issue than many is that romani culture comes with a massive amount of disdain for nonroma behaviour and peoples romanipen is a twoway barrier to integration while the hatred for romani is rarely veiled in the slightest and should definitely be addressed i think youll find that a lot of more conservative romani would probably be quite happy not integrating with the gadje its a complicated issue and not one that is ever likely to be resolved universally with romanipen in its current state this in no way excuses the majority of hate directed at the romani and the extent of the issue will vary between groups such as the kalderash and romnichal but being viewed as thieves and liars well its somewhat understandable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep my point was that there is much more to your people doing what they do then them just doing because they can there is a long history of antagonism bigotry and just plain bad blood between all sides on this subject
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would feel more comfortable sharing a bathroom with a clown than a transperson in reply to devilnddetails on the last time i went into a public bathroom there was an actual clown in there so that was pretty memorable still he just peed and then went along his business like everybody else at utc tthorm wrote i would feel more uncomfortable about sharing a bathroom with a clown than i ever would a transperson
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine being so fragile that you cant be in the same place with transgender people because it makes you uncomfortable what a special little snowflake that must be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your dignity is currency for others to use to improve their group standing thats all im saying

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men catcall because the only way to impress men is to belittle women the real misandry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how the fuck do you catcall without being lewd like how does that even work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just because the point of the act is to impress men doesnt mean it doesnt affect women how blind are they
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is one of the most frustrating things to me my female friends im a guy will always tell me about how they get yelled honked or harassed while just walking down the street it gets my blood boiling its easily stopped too because all that has to happen is for people to go hey dude thats a shitty thing to do dont do that people who try to pass it off as a joke like the people in the thread make me sick
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont you dare say toxic masculinity tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just the fact that this man is making excuses for such behaviour is ridiculous

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey lighten up its just locker roomconstruction site talk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a construction worker i dont cat call but the stupid shit my coworkers say when they do is funny they are never lewd about it though in reality cat calling is a act to impress other men in reply to sybariticfootstool on a bunch of laughs from the guys theyre driving with at utc thesomberwolf wrote yep for the laughs im a construction worker i dont cat call but the stupid shit my coworkers say when they do is funny they are never lewd about it though in reality cat calling is a act to impress other men httpiimgurcomezuidkzpng

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hope everyone is doing okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so ive been reading those leaked chat logs ive been on my staycation so ive mostly been doing things off reddit i knew td harassed people and i knew they broke numerous site rules but i wasnt aware of the extent the fact that they havent been banned after targeting doxxing and threatening moderators is irking the fuck outta me i havent finished reading the log yet but i think and hope that a blackout protest is an answer to this shit i hope the default mods are able to coordinate one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yo i was wondering what do people here listen to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,december is almost here and so now begins the annual tradition of complaining about how shit this year was and hoping that next year will be better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kind of frustrated to see fidel castro getting supported here by some of you just because communism is ideally a better philosophy than capitalism does not in any way excuse the atrocities he committed and the suffering the cuban people have endured including the lgbt community as a result of his actions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just for the record if anyone here supports fidel castro just know that he had lgbt people killed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao theyre so offended that spez shot back at people who spent an entire day calling him a pedo not to mention that this is a community built upon breaking reddit rules what a bunch of fauxoutrage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,according to a couple of posts in there srs is way worse than thewotsit because srs has literally ruined hundreds of lives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my favorite part was when some guy said theres more to life than subreddits even though he probably also believes in ethics in game journalismtm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im mostly into punk and ska stuff like nofx propagandhi lagwagon the taxpayers get dead streetlight manifesto mustard plugetc also a lot of anarcho folk punk like pat the bunny days n daze blackbird raum di nigunim
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,post punk post rock indiepop folk punk neofolk and indie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mostly rap a fair amount of jazz some hair metal some death metal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,artsy contemporary shit everything from minimalist stuff to david lynch for the ears i wasnt kidding about the david lynch comparison httpsyoutubesbctixixlq this one is the most like a standard rockpopindie album so listen to this one if youre not looking to sit down for a concert
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yikes im not very well aligned with this place musically i listen to a bunch of old funk rb soul jazz blues hiphop rock and country with a smattering of contemporary stuff a decent amount of classical lately too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mostly swing folk punk folkpunk postrock classic alternative country and blue grass as my main genres various other random things too though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i listen to way too much vaporwave nu disco and chillwave
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mostly a silly combination of first wave punk new wave and goth with a smattering of modern poppunk and the earworms that come from having a kid here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rapmidwest emo

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think its slowed after the election should pick up again around the time of his inauguration
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have noticed absolutely zero change
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i wouldnt blame people for thinking this year was shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,would never defend any of that in any form but i think when it comes to the atrocities you should consider reading into them more and why they happened and even where they were exaggerated or lied about castro himself is very open about most missteps he took and blames himself very harshly for lots of it you can read a lot of this in his autobio and also articles like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he was a hell of a lot better than batista
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have any of yall talked to a cuban in your lives like the ones in cuba or who were in cuba while castro was in power ever lol edit i just saw someone giving wildly incorrect information about cuba claiming that gay marriage has been legal for years before the united states to clarify it is not remotely legal in cuba
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fuckin love that srs communists defend a regime that rounded up gsm people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont it be the queen outlived fidel castro
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did we actually brigadedoxx at all preyishan i have absolutely no clue as i only joined srs this year and considering that most of what we hear from outside of here is really heavily biased i doubt it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literally ruined hundreds of lives a conservative guess surely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just fyi weve actually had a longstanding thing for at least years against names like yours or straight up violent rhetoric even when it is a joke maybe weve been lax on it lately but yeah i saw you in this thread and didnt immediately ban you because i realized you had been around for a while but we would prefer if you use a different name it does look like your comments fairly regularly get removed around here possibly because mods see it and assume youre a troll
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,message the mods if you havent already anace in particular is a decent sort
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,based im i hope they keep doing their new blend of genres that they did on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i literally only know of those bands p have you listened to jamaican ska like toots and the maytalls skatalites maybe upsetters things like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mind if i save your comment as a list of bands to listen to you kinda had me once propaghandi was mentioned p
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fav band
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so avalanches and neon indian then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,powerviolence punk hardcore all go no slow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would love to see it banned by then for all its rule violations
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wouldnt either but we go through this every year and the only thing thatll be different next year is that trump will be president
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im frankly embarrassed that two different users have reported this comment if you think this comment needs to go perhaps you should be the one to leave you are welcome here wingtoheavyarms and i apologize if youve been made to feel differently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is gsm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i only support him because i dont know anything about him and its fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there was like one confirmed incident ever by someone who could have been considered an srser however that wasnt actually one of the times that reddit became convinced that we were doxing all the times where reddit flipped out about us doxing people were either super clearly not us or were entirely fake sister of black visions also yishan is totally a troll and is a rich dude who just likes to have fun fucking with reddit because he never has to worry about getting a job ever again in his life he makes up narratives including about srs and dramas filled with half truths mixing it with shit he wasnt there for and just flat out doesnt know what hes talking about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have no clue since ive only been here for about a year to a year and a half i will say this though in the time ive been here i havent seen anything like that happening and the mods are very strict about us not touching the poop as they should be honestly i think a lot of people just keep repeating the myths and others just take them at their word if srs ever was that kind of place it isnt now and hasnt been for a long time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i did ice cube said we must not have noticed you before even though other mods are saying they saw me there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you too vorpal only just saw this now because i removed a troll that was stalking someone else in this thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats wrong with it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive listened to skatalites theyre good but jamaicanfirst wave ska is just too slow for me i prefer ska punk stuff that makes you want to dance and run in a circle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure go nuts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really dont have one but if i had to choose i woul pick joy division daughter mogwai or lucy rose and since he appeared in steven universe ive been enjoying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah stuff like that my favourites right now are home and
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i need some good slow beats blease but that that sounds p good tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that is a pretty big difference tho tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really appreciate that a lot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive had enough conversations with non cuban leftists about that exactly to know people totally okay with excusing it are disturbingly prevalent this is a hot topic for me lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im cuban dont talk down to me you wont find other cuban communists in this thread because castros regime allows only select people internet access but go ahead and defend him and to clarify because i get shitty comments from white leftists every time im a cuban communist who hates fidel for his war crimes and doesnt believe cubans should be expected to forgive him because communist ideology is better than capitalist ideology he committed war crimes and turned his temporary in between government into a dictatorship with a year long regime and power he literally kept in the family cuba is the only fucking place ive ever seen where someone telling you their horrible experiences is discounted because theyre from there you guys are pieces of shit who prioritize the thought exercise cubas communist attempt offered than the horrible consequences it had for the cuban people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gender and sexual minorities its a different way to say lgbt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you think the lgbtq people had fun being round up for the internment camp to do slave labour under his dictatorship
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i assume you need to throw a s in there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was banned there a few months ago and when i messaged the mods asking why they never responded to me i dont know whats going on over there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heh its mutual
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so stuff like operation ivy and kortatu yeh thats pretty dope tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yo new album is p dope tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,randy dude behind homes a funny dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate the fact that that doesnt surprise me far too many leftists are nonintersectional and only care about class or only care about gender for far too many feminists as soon as youre not oppressed by their favourite system they dont care about you i love that that attitude doesnt fly in the fempire and i wish every leftist group was like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats the communist movement like in cuba id imagine most opponents of the current regime would be supporting western liberal democracy considering a in name only communist party rules
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i apologize if i came across as if i were talking down to you i can only share my own experience with meeting other cubans and going to cuba and they were mostly positive even though i of course also witnessed the poverty and repression in cuban society
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think my half hearted interest in cigar beard man has contributed to his reign of terror
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ye it is i got 新しい日の誕生 last week and now im seriously thinking of getting that after several listens on youtube and bandcamp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree really appreciate the mods not tolerating that 👌🏼
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it has always been fractured from my understanding opposition to castro and vice versa existed between him and party leaders at various points in the past years
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah and thats like something i can acknowledge his government positively tackled very serious issues and has provided particularly incredible medical advances that can save lives worldwide but it also rounded up gay men for their moral degeneration pushed for nuclear war and viciously killed or imprisoned dissidents and it baffles me when i see people able to recognize why thats horrible in the united states but somehow expect cubans to accept and celebrate it like im gay how am i supposed to be okay with that under the excuse of machismo culture they were just like that it was a different time like someone legit tried to defend it with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actual kickstarters stereotype shitty redundant overpriced gadgets that appeal to silicon valley hipster types or terrible effortless video games that put the cart before the horse no it must be full of sjws because of one kickstarter

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,speaking of how about all the gamers who have invested thousands of dollars into star citizen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nailed it its both funny and frustrating whenever a gadget that is just getting kickstarted gets a hopefully niche but sometimes they are leaking into the mainstream because of the journalistic ignorance and laziness media coverage as if it were a real mass produced thing and the cleverest thing since the sliced bread too yet somehow its anita sarkeesian who is your typical kickstarter scammer

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit definitely needed another whats your most politically incorrect belief thread what has it been almost a whole day since the last one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not against the parade i am these folks claim that whatever trait theyre proud of is good and normal but if its normal why celebrate it im straight and white you dont see me poking it into everyones face and i ask the same of others how about we do skills parade instead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good god after reading that entire thread i had to go bleach my eyes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fucking hope these people are teenagers the idea of grown adults being so stupid is not an encouraging one

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in a lower comment whites freed american slaves oh my fucking god some people really are massive fuckwits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no white people are not taught to be ashamed of the color of their skin they are taught to think about the systems set in place that marginalize nonwhite people this is something that people of color have to think about literally all the time there is no question that historically and contemporarily people of color have been marginalized in many ways progress has been made but things are by no need equal the pride in these cases come from the need to fight against the entrenched narrative that nonwhiteness is something inherently lessthan the other thing about white identity is how it is constructed whiteness in america is not a homogenous culturepeople of any european heritages are considered white and these heritages are oftenand noncontroversiallycelebrated but whiteness as a marker of cultural identity really only means one thing not nonwhite that is to say to be proud of ones whiteness is to be proud of ones nonnonwhiteness can you see how thats problematic white people as a homogenous group have never experienced institutional racism the historic jewish struggle for instance has nothing to do with the white struggle even though jewish people are and provisionally and only very recently considered white to be asked to recognize the plight of nonwhites in america for example is not to be shamed if it feels that way to you im sorry but youll have to develop a thicker skin if the most egregious example of racism is the periodic consideration of how things are stacked against nonwhites then that kind of just proves just how skewed the playing field is thank god the problem with white pride isnt just its history but that whiteness is a constructed identity of who not to treat worse we have to overcome society constant messages to us that were worth less white people dont have to overcome anything to get to pride pointing out racism exists and white people benefit is not shaming if youre not a giant baby youre just saying youre proud to not be a poc thats why people have a problem with it

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im nonwhite so im not partial in this but from a nonwhite point of view its whites who overcame the most and are reknown over the world for being the top race you dont get there by having everything given to you if anything they have the most to be proud of brd

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,asscredit has become a real cesspool of reddit fascists thanks to the mods after rnews went out its way to ban neonazis from using recent mass killings to proselytize what did the asscredit mods do they started opening posts for these incidents to let the racists come in and go wild no wonder these come spread racist propaganda disguised as a question posts are a weekly thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,said the white person with no knowledge of white history
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a proud powerball winner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yet if blacks were proud of themselves they would say that was racist despite the historical differences
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you should be thankful im taking this knife out of your gut it was so long ago why are you still upset
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,russia and belarus are the forefront of liberty and freedom dontcha know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha wtf does free even mean is there some sort of scientifictm freedum scale im not aware of also i thought amerikkka was a fascoliberalcommunist police state being overrun by illegal immigrants
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i saw a post a long time ago where someone claimed civilization itself is thanks to white people i dont even know where to begin with this one it had so many upvotes too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae blacks are fucking idiots and non whites are fucking idiots too im ready for downvotes but i hate black people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im straight and white you dont see me poking it into everyones face im straight and white im straight and white

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its rare that a comment on the internet leaves me speechless but just
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a classic track for many redditors ♫ no such thing as privilege ♫
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and then he signs off with this peace and love and bacon yeezus christ these people are a god damn parody of themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh youd be surprised my cousins husband is one of these guys and hes a high school teacher let that sink in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only white pride that will be in my house goes in my toaster
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white americans caused black slavery you fucking idiots
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i need a long break from reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bwd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes we have to abolish whiteness thats the answer to racism white should not be an identity and we should get to a point where it is not a self construction
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cuckshed its called a coop morans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cucked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait jews are considered whitei thought they were middle eastern
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh good asa nonwhite is here to bless this stormfront copypasta and make reddit feel better about their uncritical acceptance of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you dont get there by having everything given to you thats true pretty often white people just came in and took it by force
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats nice were top in killing people too million biggest genocide in the century and noone gave a fuck because black people belgian congo million if you count the war he started in germany although hitler was white is cheating i feel top race what in top trumps kkk edition
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fucking yelled out in disbelief on this one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also hundreds of years of systemic privilege
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we should organize a reddit parade for the poor sad people so they will shut up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,asscredit hehehehehehehehehehehehe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats all well and good but how is srs directly responsible for ruining your life andor society as we know it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the next part often gets left out but it is pretty damn relevant they wont even admit the knife is there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was only just a little stabbing sheesh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or you know iowa congressman steve king
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,plot twist that op is black
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stab me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im straight and white you dont see me poking it into everyones face httpiimgurcomvewhbscgifv
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was honestly worried i sounded racist when i told my brother i prefer white bread to black bread black bread tastes like shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,freed all american slaves not all were freed immediately where they were then subject to awful conditions and instutionalised racism for a century and a half boy what an improvement they go from being someones literal property to being not really a person in the view of the government until the late and are still subject to a fuckton of discrimination today
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we need to abolish white people full stop racism and white supremacy only ends when the last white oppressor is eliminated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,depends on who else is in the room
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are nonwhite jewish people but yeah most ashkenazi jewish people are considered white and accordingly privileged though of course face a history of discrimination based on anti semitism too so its not as simple as whiteprivileged nonwhite oppressed and of course the hardcore neo nazi types dont really consider them white either so its kinda complicated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the top racewhy cant they just admit to being neo nazis whats the point of hiding it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks i hadnt even heard this bit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i stabbed that irish guy with a spoon earlier and hes not complaining
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,browses adviceanimals your opinions are now automatically invalid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dinobenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,racists are too chickenshit to hone their racist ways because they live in denial they think racists are only the people who go out burning crosses on peoples lawn and since they arent doing that then theres no way they could possibly be racist its why you hear racists often say oh dont be so sensitive or the word racist has lost all meaning
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its funnier if you read matt damon as the answer to the preceding question
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you sell shoes basketball shoes omg we had to nail the damn things to the wall and theyd still try to steal them basketball shoes should only be sold at police stations for the safety of everyone in reply to blatantconservative on i work in retail and i absolutely believe this one because the job kinda makes you racist if percent of the time a black teen comes into the store they steal or cause an issue you start to make associations i know that there are different macro incentives that make them do this and its more of an education issue than a eugenics one but still when a black teen comes into my store im watching himher a bit more secondly retail managers can absolutely have power go to their heads like this and some are pretty racist my current managers are fine but the last time place i worked openly treated brown people differently than white people and in this case the brown people worked harder and were more honest than the white people at utc hitlerhistorian wrote do you sell shoes basketball shoes omg we had to nail the damn things to the wall and theyd still try to steal them basketball shoes should only be sold at police stations for the safety of everyone httpiimgurcomsflgtaepng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a cute gif you know what would make it better some racism apparently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,too bad we cant edit the bot to show us the cute gif so we dont need to touch the poop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gif of a cute puppy titled tickling the cute potato i do not want to alarm you but that is not a potato aw shit so what have i been eating all this time then its okay to admit that youre korean in reply to kmlkmljkl on aw shit so what have i been eating all this time then at utc wrote its okay to admit that youre korean httpiimgurcomflcvmgwpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,swiss people eat cats just throwin that out there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha its funny because koreans distinguished farm raised food differently than the west not to mention that dog meat is highly controversial in sk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is it controversial in north korea too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you cute is indeed cute
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would assume not i mean north korea has a fascist government extremely large wealth inequality in an already destitute economy and a lack of food supply if youre starving and havent eaten in days dog meat is pretty appealing but its a much different situation with sk which isnt a dictator has a large economy and secured food supplies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,right maybe op meant north korean or more likely op probably meant vietnamese where dog meat is actually a commodity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the most infuriating circlejerk on reddit ive come across he attacks the media for taking things out of context and then blatantly takes the articles criticizing him out of context like he says vox called me a nazi because of my fashion when vox was really quoting an actual nazi saying they should praise him because of his fashion and he says that they took a screen cap of his stretched out arm and pretended it was a heil when he was actually doing the heil talking about how hes like hitler to little girls and cutting to hitler youth videos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that was an intense roast of people at wsj almost reminds me of how hitler roasted people during wwii at utc asiansensationz replied to that was an intense roast of people at wsj almost reminds me of how hitler roasted people during wwii httpiimgurcommvjcxjcpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mate you dont get it sjws got btfo get cucked but seriously i wouldnt expect these enlightened defenders of the poor youtubers with millions of subscribers to actually use logic and their almighty context when it goes against their views when this pewdiepie nazi thing went down just visiting the altright subreddit showed them praising him for being woke and redpilling his young userbase actually theres probably archive links of those threads
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imo sargon doesnt hate nazis he hates being called a nazi if you repackaged all nazi ideals into a fancy new box called le defenders of western civilization hed be the first one throwing around notnazi salutes and notgassing people also i i think besides doing it for popularity being reactionary is just pretty common for people who dont contribute much to society except for making maymay videos those that actually to stop and think before complaining or have basic education and human decency are probably not going to have tons of dedicated subs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,worst thing about that video is how pewdiepie links directly to sargons channel in the description why is it when youtubers get caught doing some bad shit they always quadruple down on it jontron did the same thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even if somehow the media did take what he said of of context which they didnt he is attacking a strawman and not even bothering to read the articles i dont see how his reason for it is any better one of the richest internet celebrities from sweden dangling cash in front of poor hungry kids from india and asking them to say derogatory things in a language they barely understand then blaming them and fiverr saying its their fault and that theyre being greedy and desperate i mean no fucking shit you would be too if you were them do people like this guy even know what it feels like to be hungry id like to see his rich privileged ass survive a day in a developing country without a single cent that alone was tone deaf enough then the fact that he made them say nazi shit and not realize what hes doing wrong fuck everything about pdp and his defenders
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and their almighty context funny how they always want to decide when context is and isnt important
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the it was just a social experiment bro defense is also incredibly stupid either hes a dumbass that did things incredibly inappropriate for children on a channel aimed at young people or he knew this would happen which makes him an incredible asshole also yeah he pretty much fucked over those indian lads from fiver i heard they got banned along with him from the site but i dunno if they got allowed back on seeing as how they were the victims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah his whole argument now besides attacking strawmenmisrepresenting the articles is that it was just a joke it always astonishes me how its just a prank bro is seen as a perfectly valid excuse for popular youtubers i cant even imagine being that privileged its like these people arent even living in the same reality as the rest of us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that was an excellent video thank you for posting it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they were allowed back on fiver
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they literally didnt even remove anything they changed their algorithm slightly and it resulted in stormfront becoming the second result for the search did the holocaust happen instead of the first result edit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,said the reddit user and paragon of tolerance nofattys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,google decides and because its their service
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,important more valid more supported by facts more moral more ethical more internally consistent there are many grounds on which to judge an opinionand holocaust denialism fails on each and every one of them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,claim that is objectively false opinion pick one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just realized i fucked up this post by submitting this as a text post oops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know where the line is for what counts as garbage reddit nazis nazis are that line
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,google is now providing an algorithm that ensures you are provided with reputable sources that give you accurate information but my freeze peach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people who have actually studied history and science rather than eating conspiracies for breakfast you turd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lets play a game go to googlecom type in the word jew jews or zionism and followed by literally anything that has ever been debated not just blm or but things like interest rate hike or planned parenthood or whatever you want look at all the antisemetic garbage that comes up that was caused by the jooz it really is a fun game until you realize basement dwelling neonazis have the same reputation on the internet as anyone who claims to be a college professor bc we are all completely anonymous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clean your room honey its all garbage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,posts on trees and is trump supporter color me surprised
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be frank the question youre using as an example sounds pretty loaded but it is disturbing that the system has learned to predict what kind of people are asking such questions and provide them with search returns that only reinforce their bias
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,posts to tia publicfreakout and bpt as well truly the last bastion of pure humanity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ahh brings me back to the fph ban days d so many crying manlets i wish there was a rbestofoutrageculture but just dedicated to the whiniest fphers complaining about free speech violations and how theyre going to prove the admins point by harassing users even further
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,havent you heard you judge a democracy by how well you treat the neonazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit should be in the charge of water parks because they seem to have the greatest ideas on slippery slopes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they have to call it an opinion otherwise its too obvious that free speech isnt something that should enable you to spread lies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now you have to put in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,u were not kidding
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,zero hits for jew firefly canceled
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a completely legitimate concern google holds immense power over the world this sets a precedent which may be abused since googles algorithms are secret we dont know what they censor and what they dont they already do this if it were a serious concern for you or anyone in that thread whyd it take holocaust denial websites to put you over the edge and not the cases of legitimate businesses that loses ranking to other businesses and in either case you can still find the information or disinformation as the case may be but its now on page two thats some lazy ass censorship if you ask me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,didnt even know that was a thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if youre talking about the really i get the same result when searching did the holocaust happen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,our university president recently defended neonazis posting propaganda on our campus with phrases like white pride is acceptsble and white people protect your families from multiculturalism the links on the pamphlet got even worse our university president blabbed on about supporting freedom of speech the fliers were not inherently hateful and aggressive or whatever and if isis posted fliers on our campus with something that is not inherently hateful or aggressive like happy holidays is the example he used he would defend their right to do it too there were so many things wrong there fuck you purdue
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no water park managed by reddit would have passed even the most basic safety test maybe in the libertarian world where safety tests are for the weaklings and the market sorts it all by itself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but then id have to use low friction shorts which being low friction cause embarrassing situations
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everything becomes a general rule unless its something they want in which case its their right and youre wrong for being critical of it you must hate freedom or something white guys not getting that white men are a protected class edit for bonus rage seriously though even if you were a bernie bro how can it not be glaringly obvious that societys tendency to privilege white men is currently being exploited by actual fascists how are you supposed to fight against a threat that wont listen to reason and is still being treated as if it is legitimate political speech dont these free speech defenders realize they are the reason that nazis are goose stepping in washington
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nazis are a protected class s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only winning move is to not play
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the fact that the only result for that question is not simply the word yes with nothing else is disheartening
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and there would be a ban on bathing suits for girls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditirl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,law of robotics coming in with most irrelevant comment ever do you recognize that paid leave just for women means women will be effectively paid more than men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont even need to check the thread to know therell be a slew of redditors failing to understand the basics of causecorrelation as well as slinging forward a bunch of misinformation and badly sourced garbage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what myth or misconception do people spread around all the time that pisses you off the wage gap myth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if is totally insignificant do you reckon hell give me of his salary also i believe the wage gap is about to percent when all known factors are accounted for not percent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they are scared that to fix the wage gap that men will take a hit in lower pay to balance it out rather than women being given more to make it fair hence their overconcern
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just going to post some resources for others study shows that wages start going down once women enter high paying fields meaning that a womans work is so undervalued that prestigious jobs become less prestigious solely because woman have them a very easily digestible article that refutes almost every point redditors make its per job women chose lower paying jobs etc very heavy on links to scholarly articles i know evidence like this doesnt mean anything to redditors as freakanomics academia but its nice to have this if you happen into a conversation with someone who you feel may actually be willing to change their awful views
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh look this thread again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh gawd i have yelled at the poop i dont know why i do this to myself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what myth or misconception do people spread around all the time that pisses you off stupidity a vague nonsensical concept thats applied to anything and everything theists use a deity to explain unusual events conservatives and fauxgressives use stupidity to explain unusual behaviour and thoughts its also an excuse to harass people directly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that white people arent illegals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what myth or misconception do people spread around all the time that pisses you off the wage gap at utc replied to the wage gap its an average of the salaries of all men and all women who are able to work and therefore doesnt adjust for the tendency of women to work less due to maternity leave willingly staying at home to raise children and choosing less lucrative career paths in college the difference when all of the above is accounted for is about i suppose it isnt fair or acceptable by any means but its negligible compared with the absurd figures spoonfed to us on college campuses edit also vaccines dont cause autism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey everybody nothing exists gravity doesnt account for people deciding to jump in the air vanilla being the least popular ice cream flavor why doesnt account for people choosing to like chocolate more outdoor carpet getting dirtier than indoor carpet doesnt account for there being more dirt outdoors ford pinto being the most popular car doesnt account for people choosing it for its super cool modern shape and innovative rear fuel system as well as random rabid canines since when can anything be written off as nonexistent by saying well if you take away all the reasons this exists it doesnt exist any longer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can everyone state here their degree position gender salary and the pay of a coworker of the opposite gender with the exact same position and experience thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh is law of robotics a thing i have been having the most tremendous fun with him all evening
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men have the same right to maternity leave as women but if you get your information from a welldocumented shitposter then theres nothing i can say to help you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a white boys primary strategy against assertions of privilege always seems to boil down to no actually you are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that guy is scary i bet hes a bot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats just not how math works
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre telling me that breitbart time forbes psychology today conservapedia and of youtube arent top quality sources for everything blasphemy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what freakonomics isnt the bastion of academic integrity i thought it was s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the wage gap myth myth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought the difference was more like when controlling for position and experience and such
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to percent they like to quote only the studies with the lowest estimates and round down obviously the lowest in the range given by the consad report popular because it gives a low controlled range and because its summary contains a few phrases that can be copypastad out of context to look maximum mythiness becomes or percent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but even the notion that you can just account for these factors by throwing them away is absurd it would make sense if it was some immutable law of nature that for example women tend to choose lowerpaying careers but that clearly isnt the case
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,capitalism is a game
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey i got your back ill yell at poop with you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men and women do not get paid differently for the same work false thats a a crime people commit crimes very often actually b grounds for a lawsuit if it were actually happening and then youre fighting a massive corporate legal team women make less than men because they choose to take feminist dance therapy instead of studying electrical engineering you are a dummy women are well represented in stem graduates those that leave stem fields generally cite a huge amount of discrimination and sexism they face in the workplace facts dont care about your feelings is that why you keep making them up i have been banned from this subreddit for disagreeing with you backwards retards good to know you guys value logic and discussion says they guy who comes in here and does a big hatespew of antisj buzzwords and unproven claims edit also love the brigading going on right now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fail to see how this is a bad thing we could stand to have less in the world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a white male i had a boss that got fired and replaced with a female she quickly cut my hours and what little time i do work is spent in the makeshift spermjackotron she and the rest of my feeeeemale coworkers made to steal my superior male seed women right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he rears his ugly head in every thread that involves even the slightest amount of bigotrygeneral stupidity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hes reddit famous in the metasphere
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait psychology today is it more of a pop magazine or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you may well be right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for the correction
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,definitely but the purpose of accounting for the factors is to reveal that even when you take into account all the systemic biases against women theres still a wage gap that can only be explained by overt discrimination
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it really is sad seeing how disenfranchised workers are these days i dont think theres ever been a time in history where the working class was so complacent with our capitalist overlords and so quick to point the finger at their comrades instead of their bosses
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,except it goes the other way as well when men take interest in a job and start pushing out the women said job becomes more prestigious and pays better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just gotta do it sometimes you know thanks for the solidarity crusaders against poop unite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how just file a lawsuit is a justification because its apparently so easy case in point that is not easy walmart class action lawsuit on gender discrimination that began in all ongoing to this day although the app pale courts eventually denied the ability to go forward as a class twice very unfortunate httpbusinesshumanrightsorgenwalmartlawsuitregenderdiscriminationinusa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im scarred for life now thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the propaganda has gotten so much more effective and surreptitious i think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,see my field computer science
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have no idea what youre talking about its certainly not a trap for trumpeters its not like they have the guts to click it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh wow i didnt realize that i havent had much call to read it or anything or i might have noticed sooner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yup
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shudder
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,corporations routinely employ slaves so im not sure why youre shocked that they willingly behave unethically companies arent obligated to my knowledge to disclose their salaries to their workers or the media
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it also every single guys fantasy rtherealmisandry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at the end of the year he gives her an f and she reports his ass straight up tells the principle look i slept with this guy for an a and he failed me then the floodgates opened and we found out it was like girls over the course of the ten years hed been teaching there probably even more that didnt confess to the act jesus the teacher was going for a record here on top of that its not every single guys fantasy if we didnt grow up in a world where not chasing every pair of tits meant you were gay and open to ridicule wed see that most guys are just fine with monogamy i like the chase is a line for children who refuse to grow the hell up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in the same thread on a different comment theres some guy joking about a dad filming a middle school lesbian orgy of course the one person that complains is downvoted heavily and all the responses are along the lines of its just a joke bro or its reddit i dont know why these kind of dark humor jokes or just cringey jokes in general eg messed up masturbation jokes are so popular on reddit saying any of things in real life would probably garner you weird looks and social ostracization or at least i hope so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rjesuschristreddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and yes i understand what he was doing is wrong but holy shit is it also every single guys fantasy under the age of about about a teacher serial raping his students in reply to ducttapechainsaw on high school teachers what juicy drama is going around your high i honestly dont remember how much time he got i didnt follow the sentencing part of the story and i had moved away to college before he had his day in court this was way before social media shared every stinking detail of every stinking story on earth no it was more than just bjs he went the full deal with many of these girls including the girl who broke the story at utc pschweezy wrote damn he should have just passed her being able to retire and getting away with this would be the crime of the fucking century straight legendary then he could wait until after the statute of limitations and write a book about it and open his own porno company recreating all of the scenes and yes i understand what he was doing is wrong but holy shit is it also every single guys fantasy under the age of about httpiimgurcomdytpzbbpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont wanna sound lika a jerk but are we vote brigading again please dont do that we hate his guts comment but please please just dont touch the poop ew
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate this website
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it reminds me of the everpopular rasscredit thread what would you do if you were invisible the top response is always rape everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women accuses man of thinking about sex all the time men arent obsessed with sex at all man rapes woman not his fault we can only think of sex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and if polygamypromiscuity wasnt seen entirely differently according to gender
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,true but if youre subbed to the sub i think you can vote anyways cant you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and its phrased as if you wouldnt rape people youre lying theyre convinced that everyone is as depraved as them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for straight men so proud of their cispeens they sure love having it both ways
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have you ever notice how theyll call a woman a slut and a whore for not sleeping with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pretty sure you can vote and comment without being subbed in most subs and its okay to do that im specifically talking about voting on linked comments shitredditsays is not a downvote brigade do not downvote any comments in the threads linked from here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre bihorrible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes i have been to rniceguys its wonderfully horrible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god damn thats a funny joke ill need to see it at least more times before i start getting bored of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the single funniest joke of all time other jokes would get boring after being repeated times but not this one atack heikotper am i right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on a post about replacing swear words with ice cream flavors did you just assume gender maybe heshe is a neopolitan in reply to on so what her mum wants her just to swear instead of saying ice cream flavours at utc jdoesddr wrote did you just assume gender maybe heshe is a neopolitan
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can we not do the thing where we focus on spellinggrammar mistakes in already shitty comments ive been noticing this more and more lately and its really not cool for a whole bunch of reasons including but not limited to ableism classism and mockery of esl speakers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fair enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the moment the words but thats not how you protest comes out of your mouth is the moment youve completely missed the point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are none of these redditors going to pay attention to the source the washington times is a conservative newspaper who knows how accurate their reporting actually is reddit always jumps to questioning the source unless the source backs up their own views
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine if i acted like my ancestors acted for so many centuries evokes it to threaten others
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if it was somebody stopping poc or lgbtq students from entering a part of campus they wouldnt have heard about it or given a shit even if they had there is a reason why stories like this one where it negatively effects white people get a hundred times more press than say schools barring trans students from using any restroom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine if they were evil space aliens blocking michael jordan from getting to class oh that would be different wow what a concept
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now for a moment imagine that there was a white student from say bosnia and herzegovina or kosovo who lost his whole family in the war in the balkans in trying to get through he would be denied entry because of his white privilege he is privileged to have witnessed his family been murdered he is privileged he and his family were actually treated like slaves he is so much more privileged because all of this and more compared to some poc whos father is a ceo of some company who was born with silver spoon yes the latter really really needs the safe space and former really really needs to be bullied some more i wouldnt be surprised if this exact scenario took place at this very event in some form can someone explain why the balkan state examples come up so often every time i see this debate circlejerk about poc being the real racists on reddit someone from the balkans chimes in and says life is harder for them and therefore poc should shut up as if to say multiple issues cant exist for different people and exist indepdently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know if uvorpaleskimo can use this one but here goes hey look a white person who thinks they have the authority to tell civil rights protestors how to protest take a shot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have any of these pissbabies ever heard of the word context
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its year and whitey still hasnt discovered the meaning of context however in this year inconveniencing white people is still the worst crime against humanity id love to hear how whitey thinks you should protest to people who wont pay any attention to you if you dont make them ask nicely beg plead cross your fingers and hope for the best edit quick grab your dild shields were being brigaded
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think these people know what a protest is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes when you reverse things they become different when you make things different different things happen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,technically hes not wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine if it was a bunch of white kids not letting non white or transgender students go to class these people are idiots yes can you imagine the current reality that exists can you imagine it ill take woosh for alex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like they did just decades ago
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ow that thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpimgurcomlpoqpsn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean like most of us history we dont have to imagine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is as racist as you can get hooooooo theres some hyperbole for you edit this was someones comment in the original thread the possibility of someone being prejudicial towards white people is literally as racist as you can get to at least one redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not how you protest for positive change imagine if it was a bunch of white kids not letting non white or transgender students go to class these people are idiots at utc dropkickninja replied to thats not how you protest for positive change imagine if it was a bunch of white kids not letting non white or transgender students go to class these people are idiots
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just imagine how it would feel to be unwelcome at your school what if white people made black people feel that way that would never happen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,be a good minority and protest the way we let you said the white person lacking selfawareness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey excuse me could you protest in a way that ill never notice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyll upvote rt on the reg its not about the quality of the reporting just the quality of the outrage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres definitely something missing from this story holy fuck though cis white redditors love being victims of the true oppression of america reverse racism against whites s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,conservative newspaper protrump rag you mean
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,darn space jam warriors ruin everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because redditeurs are desperate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tangentially related i just finished a six part documentary on the death of yugoslavia and the wars that occurred in its aftermath it included enormous amounts of face to face interviews with all the main figures including milosevic filmed almost immediately after the peace conference had concluded the conflict i learned three things everyone did horrible genocidal shit in that conflict but the serbs led the pack by a country mile slobodan milosevic is funny smart polite and looks like a goofy uncle which makes it all the more terrifying that this guy was seized by an insane nationalist need to ethnically cleanse all non serbs from what had previously been a peaceful relatively harmonious multiethnic state richard holbrook is a hilarious salty bastard holbrookholbrook for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah if i imbibe alcohol i lose my immunity to paradox and banality e also any drinking game based on whites on reddit would result in death
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ask nicely beg plead cross your fingers and hope for the best hey now begging and pleading can get annoying you ask nicely—once—and cross your fingers—behind your back so they dont have to look at it—and hope for the best
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate that people dont understand that you cant just switch the roles like that social and historical context means itll be a completely different situation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre supposed to use telepathy i think but only really subtle telepathy so youre not crowding out the white thoughts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a protest is something that quietly exists in the distance and does not disturb anyone in any way so that it can be completely ignored while whitebros carry on with their daytoday activities and dont have to waste any time thinking about anything that doesnt directly impact them personally clearly anything else is protesting the wrong way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well when you stand for the status quo and your opponents are raising real points then you have to just start making up new definitions to avoid confronting the actual arguments theyre making
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reactionaries will react and be delusional about what currently happens in their safe spaces
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair its posted on reddit so the statement isnt entirely false
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white person lacking selfawareness oh so a liberal then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,darn space jam warriors monstars ruin everything ftfy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,racism is a hierarchical system where people are sorted into categories racialized based on certain characteristics which are not exclusive to skin colour saying you have white skin colour means white privilege doesnt exist is absurd when your skin colour is not the basis of your racialization this is assuming you mean people from the caucasus are discriminated in the us if you mean life is hard in the caucasus then i flatout dont understand your point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think they were asking you to shoot that person not drink and by think i meant hope
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or be like my town and say no contribute to the solution in regardings to the poor panhandling im proud of the anarchist groups that tore them down edit i got downvoted because anarchist took down classist signs this subreddit is amazing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in whites the cispeen not the brain is the seat of cognition
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know protest just how dr king did
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i prefer white moderate as penned in the letter from birmingham
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,has multiple posts in the last few days on shitliberalssay im sure this is a levelheaded opinion and youre not just baiting for a fight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im the worst marksman in my family so i wouldnt be any help
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what how dare those jobless people not have a job
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shitliberalssay is a left wing sub people talk shit about liberals in here as well like all the time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bribe one of your relatives then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but those rich white sorority girls are totally ok to beg for money so they can party with there friends and get volunteer experience while breaking the same fucking laws its all about the charity aesthetic edit me discussing the inequality and transparancy of hate against the poor and how white rich kids get away with it and get downvoted in srs god this sub blows
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hmm im not familiar but can you see how the name of that subreddit sounds really negative and inflammatory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a left wing sub that bans anarchists for being against genocide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rich white conventionally attractive sorority girls ftfy if theyre uggos than itd be illegal to or whatever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,liberalism is a centrist idealogy based around market economies with privately owned capital and hierarchical representative democracies for some reason americans use liberal to solely mean democrat but in reality both major parties and both minor parties are various types of liberal shitliberalssay is a socialist sub with a major bent towards marxistleninismwhich is a flavor of socialism i personally dislike but so it goes socialists regardless of the flavor tend to dislike liberals as liberalism is inherently capitalist and usually very wishy washy on social issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess but you can also always click on it and just check its just a sub full of leftists who complain about bourgeoisie liberal positivity politics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the american use of the world liberal vs the socialist use of the word liberal theyre similar but have different connotations
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and until once whitebros realize contributing to their fundraiser doesnt secks then its bullshit and burn it to the ground and salt the earth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no actually thats wrong edit a sororityfrat member has never been arrested for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for the explanation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and yet they ban leftanarchists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think he thinks youre a conservative because youre bashing on liberals when in reality youre trying to point out that the liberal establishment can be ignorant as well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because liberals think protecting private property and the means of productions from the workers is a good thing both meanings mean the same but americans dont realize its not socially just
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well they should be not only should being displeasing to the cispeen be illegal it should be a capital offense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mmmhmm no problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,marxistlenisists whatre ya gonna do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats what i was trying to get at it thanks you said it better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im confused why you are replying to this and distracting from the topic on hand i know heavier people face problems with law enforcement but even fat white people get white privilege especially if they are of upper to middle class
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not team up with them because theyll stab you in the back thats for damn sure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sarcasm the rich white fraternity guys are all in favor of rich white sorority girls begging for money but only if they are attractive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mmhmm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its gross because theyre the ones betraying lefty principles and their fellow leftists while decrying the ones they backstab for the same total darvo move
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,power never wants to give itself up it will always work for its own interests regardless of its stated purpose transitional dictatorships will never transition
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,power never wants to give itself up it will always work for its own interests regardless of its stated purpose amen to that pal transitional dictatorships will never transition nor are dictatorships of the proletariat actually of the proletariat theyre just dictatorships bakunin wasnt right about everything but he was incredibly right about how the whole marxism thing turned out in a prescient way as is weirdly typical of anarchist thinking anarchism is kind of fun for being prescient about stuff but not very fun because its really depressing once you think about stuff you see stuff that you cant unsee
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your last line reminds me of httpspatthebunnybandcampcomtracktimesworthlivingthetension which echos a lot of my feelings in reaction to history politics and economics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it honestly feels sofutile
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on japan profiling muslims when are people going to realize that its only whiteguilt led countries that give a shit about profiling people or being ethnocentric no country led by nonwhite people gives a shit about sjw stuff whole thread is awful at utc butthenitgotodd replied to when are people going to realize that its only whiteguilt led countries that give a shit about profiling people or being ethnocentric no country led by nonwhite people gives a shit about sjw stuff
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those who follow a dangerous set of beliefs so metal heads rockers mormons oh i know youre talking about nra members or maybe exmarines i dunno man youre way too fucking vague uwanderingperv getin
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the wise man bowed his head solemnly and spoke theres actually zero difference between good bad things you imbecile you fucking moron
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or maybe the evidence for a holocaust is so overwhelming that denying it is irrational this guy sounds like a creationist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian is actually one of the laziest life philosophies that lets people think theyre being more critical than they actual are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you want to know who rules you learn who it is you cant criticize uhhhh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,psst hey guy everyone says that you shouldnt jump off a fucking bridge you want to be a cool rebel and test that fucking theory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that commenter should be forced to watch the us militarys vintage classic warning graphic footage of concentration camps and victims on a loop for a few days
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also what fucking point is there to questioning it do they think that nobody in the history of the world has ever studied it or researched it or debated it or gathered evidence or collected testimonials that some dudebros on reddit are the first to ever question this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literal holocaust denialism on the front page of reddit now do yall see why you dont get upset about a private bookstore not stocking holocaust denialist literature like would it kill them to put their egos aside for a tenth of a second to listen to everybody who has debated and challenged holocaust denialism professionally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean you can certainly ask questions about it questions like what happened how do we know what was the reason the estimates have changed over the years being ignorant of history or the historical process is fine its the part where yoy see all the evidence and make a silly conclusion that you get judged for it source annoyed history major
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah did you go out and independently verify the other planets did you verify that gasoline came from dinosaurs maybe go verify that putting your thumb in your eye is a bad idea you fucking tool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am going to question this commenters humanity please provide evidence you are a human so i can ignore it and deny it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the earth is flat a basketball player said so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae if you cant peddle your neonazi theories it makes the world literally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people always tell me the earth is round if you question the idea that the earth is round people think youre ridiculous and laugh at you they want you to think the earth is round therefore the earth is flat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dril is a prophet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly what is there to question
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hmm maybe people in charge know crushing dissent actually looks worse than allowing it hmm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those pointyheaded academics say that gravity is a law who do they think they are i didnt vote for it its the opinion of gravity i say
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,with those clockwork orange things that force eyes to stay open
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no im just saying its ridiculous to say the people you cant criticize readsay racist things about are always the ones with power
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whoops thought you were replying to a different comment of mine my bad i was in a debate about hitler somewhere else on reddit at the time you commented
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh all right i was a bit confused
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why the fuck is a rapist talking to elementary school kids in the first place fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fhritp fuck her right in the pu not a sexist or gender discriminating remark missing context is the guy shouting it in a cafeteria was also under investigation for raping another student at florida state university just a joak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe im being ridiculous yes yes you are this is referring to the person who made the featured comment not srs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jameis winston can go fuck himself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe im being ridiculous but i dont think fhritp is a sexist and gender discriminating remark about women its sorta like the shouting penis quietly and than louder and louder game immature and not something id do but ultimately more stupid than harmful in reply to on yeah umm jameis we know your thoughts on women and their place now idgaf about player character at all paging uvbullinger and i love jameis as a qb and would welcome him on my team with all of his character flaws but i bet there are about to be a bunch of jameis supporters who stick their heads in the stand and who will try to downplay this as well as his previous actions and then try to say that theres no fire where there was smoke in his sexual assault accusation too at utc chemlok wrote maybe im being ridiculous but i dont think fhritp is a sexist and gender discriminating remark about women its sorta like the shouting penis quietly and than louder and louder game immature and not something id do but ultimately more stupid than harmful httpiimgurcomrqqxnxepng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha i got notified about this because i was mentioned in the comment im the guy that likes guys without any character issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,another day another shitty transphobic joke gets upvoted on reddit todays is thai flavored tomorrow probably helicopter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh default subs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does that girl have her own d repackaged thai product at utc samjamgoose replied to does that girl have her own d httpiimgurcomclqsvnwpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there was a post earlier on rall of a dog doing dog stuff and the title was he identifies as a tornado or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and if youre especially unlucky you might find some fusion cuisine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and thats most of reddits transjoke repertoire maybe they should save everyone some time and make jokes about thai attack helicopters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uh thats not calling them on it thats making another transphobic joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,complete with because they stopped pretending
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean fusion cuisine like kimchi and coffee icecream mixed and left to sit for days
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that dog is more excited for whatever the fuck is going on there than i will ever be about anything in my entire life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol do these reactionary clods ever stop to think that they would be executed themselves if their utopia came about fudging your tax return stealing a newspaper from your neighbors lawn jaywalking excessive noise public intoxication speeding breaking business regulations that youre not even aware exists sorry the law mandates death it is the only logickal way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,property human life god bless america amirite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it works very very little petty theft in texas kill kill kill kill kill the poor reddit is pretty much pinochet at this point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for a phone this guy would shoot someone over his phone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rshitamericanssay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know what though i agree with these guys employers who commit wage theft should be shot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not really a thiefs life is worthless and if they are trying to steal from people they have forfeited their life as they know it is always a chance they could be shot for trying to rob people this is repulsive edit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh properly rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rshitamericanssay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is such a useless argument because it doesnt specify what how and why but sure go ahead and wave vague fears of some type of crime in my face in order to support your desire to shoot people freedom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fucking hell that whole thread murdering humans for petty theft wonder how they feel about sharia law
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rlatestagecapitalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this point any given thread is indistinguishable from stormfront
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae muh castle laws
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,property isnt worth killing over i might make an exception for things of such sentimental value that it would cast a pall over your entire life afterwards but generally that stuff can be defended without deadly force
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,op you make it sound like one shouldnt be allowed to shoot a redditor for attempting to shitpost against them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you make it sound like one shouldnt be allowed to shoot another for attempting to commit a crime against them in reply to theoldstoryline on ah good ol brazil now if u were an off duty police you couldve shot him to death for attempting to rob u at utc wrote you make it sound like one shouldnt be allowed to shoot another for attempting to commit a crime against them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i honestly think we should give them their walledoff utopia let them take a state and secede have the federal government give everyone who wants to leave a massive stipend and a gratis move for the people who cant or wont leave just form enclaves or something id give it a year before they had a fullblown socialist revolution
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,punitiveness only pretends to be about order its actually about having an excuse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont forget vidya piracy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clods if every subreddit were perfect we wouldnt have srs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but even that statement about petty theft is false
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some kids vandalized my car last year maybe i should have been allowed to shoot them since a car is more than a phone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but thats impossible because reddit believes in innocent until proven guilty oh wait thats only for rapists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no this guy wouldnt because this guy doesnt own a gun and has no plans to comments like this are the real shit reddit says the imaginations of the people on this site continue to amaze me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seize the means of production
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he posts in thedonald what a surprise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wonder how they feel about western imperialism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a thiefs life is worthless fucking wow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these are the same sorta people who are afraid of sharia law with their entire life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they hate sharia in name but advocate for it in practice more or less ive seen exactly that on reddit some guy wanted to beat women who didnt shave their legs or some shit cant remember exactly what his whine was in accordance with some news article on a pakistani extremist group that advocated for sharia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i genuinely want texas to secede they can take em
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously everyone i know steal shit its just a way of life when youre poor like how you think that chick who makes like a year is affording that badass hair dye its pretty much only complete idiotsright libertariansetc who think stealing from massive corporations is wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if they were redditors no jury in the world would convict you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors cheer on every attempt at vehicular manslaughter when someones blocking a freeway so probably
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was a long time ago but if i recall correctly that was the reaction redditors had when this happened to a celebrity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i mean are you black
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i got my info from the comment claiming it should be legal to kill someone for petty theft
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im from alaska all the illegals talk like that its true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the same trump known for swindeling people out of their money irony
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre totally not racist though you see according to chris rock phd in african american studies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,number one with fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and the same sort of people who were idealizing it before i shit you not i remember this shit from when i was a kid conservatives would mention fondly how sharia advocates for chopping off the hands of thieves then happened and they werent allowed to like it anymore whenever america switches its bad guy to another people theyll go back to advocating for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but how can you kill the gubmint
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how theyd have your gun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,texas just needs to kick out the fucking white people then it would be great wherever chicanos live its nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unless the person you shot was white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i bet theyd like to auction off the car theyd have used too and then do whatever the fuck assholes do with the profits of their crimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why with freeze peach of course
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah gun culture so much less useful than yogurt cultures
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but would you be willing to fight your own gun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,arent those terms synonymous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gun culture not guns themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are also bigoted people who think theyre smart httpswwwredditcomrthedonald
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hmmm the citizens of japan seem to be doing fine without them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh sure but my people are subsistence hunters and rifles are now the weapons of choice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edit holy shit i replied to a comment from a whole other sub here accidentally youve got a good point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait was that about guns or something else because now im curious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i noticed really quickly and changed it my original reply was supposed to be in rcomicbooks and was about captain america
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hi your post was removed for rule
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,watchitfortheplot upvotes fictional rape scene one user says why has nobody mentionedthat this is a rape scene gets buried under thermian arguments at utc littlebutmighty replied to shes attractive but shes clearly getting raped in this scene whyhow has no one mentioned this why is this supposed to be a turnon its making my ladybits want to hide somewhere in my abdomen edit seriously guys also i see no ones responding because it really is clearly rape httpiimgurcomnsobxtnpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dunno if this technically meets the post guidelines but it might be worth an effort post ick
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,huh what slurs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh derp how would you make a compliant title for this im new to the worlds premier secret sjw islamoilluminati cultural marxist subreddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry i meant this one we should probably fix that to avoid confusion titles should be direct quotes of comments no editorializing followed by the number of total votes in brackets like this effortpost titles can be anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like its okay to provide a little bit of necessary context but it just has to be very objective in this case i think the quote makes sense on its own shes clearly getting raped in this scene whyhow has no one mentioned this would have been fine as a title however hold off on posting it because i want to discussclarify our rule about comments that have negative scores i will get back to you i feel like it might be fine but the score should be or worse nbsp an example of context for future reference would be something like on a photo of a swimmer at the olympics would bang that kind of thing make sense nothing subjective really
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,let me tell you about my cispeen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well now i know to never share my wedding pictures thanks reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nobody fucking cares about your penis that whole post is just full of shit shit shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey maybe dont fetishize gay couples thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the best part it theyre doing it for the attention why must men try and corrupt all the beautiful gay love in this world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me aww they look really sweet together redditor let me ruin your happiness and theirs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow a harry potter cosplay with brown hair literally as usual reddit continues to be a massive dumpster fire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,see my flair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,let me make your wedding about my wiener
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but never mention your vagina because its gross and disgusting unlike my misshapen third thumb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,above all the cispeen must be pleased
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have this experience in a larger sense the more time i spend on the internet the less i want to be on it and share anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre also totally fine with nonthreatening above average looking white gay dudes now granted they do start to spook if said dudes are doing anything more affectionate than standing next to each other
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,attractive femme lesbians oh who am i kidding everyone on reddit knows you have to be femme to be attractive s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its disrespectful and rude especially because its a wedding but even if it were not still rude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because the sexy women are supposed to want him goddamnit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i went backwards and saw the reddit comments first then i looked at the album and it made me feel better it was like eyebleach i especially loved the one where they were dressed up as sailor neptune and sailor uranus so sweet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wish i could just post that gif of the cackling lizard whenever a thread linked here gets locked or a comment gets deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to use a swedish saying the interest club is taking notes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep its why i do everything i can to stay off social media outside my secret identity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im totally ok with gays i just dont want to hearseehave it ever be mentioned within miles of me and id prefer you dont act gay but im totally ok with it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unless its another mans ass then its super male homo and they dont like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i had a dollar for every time ive heard a straight girl say gay porn is so hot i would have enough money for the legal fees to put a restraining order on all of them same goes for straight men with lesbians obviously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brag maybe i did a little i never meant to but was simply stating that its overrated and most creepy perverts dream about doing it yet they have no idea what its really like they also would have no idea how to handle it its not really that simple especially if you all sorta know each other ground rules make or break it of the time it dies half way through because of jealousy discomfort or both nbsp i also couldnt find the correct word for them adventures seemed fitting to me because that sort of thing was taboo to my wife and i for quite some time not the idea the reality would have just said straight up threesome but that took the edge away in my mind made it sound generic when it was a unique experience to me and my partner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,meanwhile let me talk about how much i love naked women and how many girls i wanna bang and also let me be pretty sexist about it with my guy friends were just doing the locker room talk dont mention dicks tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,third wave feminism as defined by sargon of akkad and the amazing atheist not as defined by people within the movement or people who are meant to hold to npov
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love when they specify third wave specifically like yea you know i was ok with feminism up until the wave where it started at least pretending to give a shit about women who are neither cis nor white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,didnt these manbabies throw tantrums over ghostbusters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black lives matter and feminism are unnecessary and they just want to be victims a white male
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh boy i was just waiting for redditors to get together and cream their licensedcharacter boxers over that letter its like perfectly crafted to pander to their weird sort of internet tough guyenlightened jaded nerd selfimage and these fuckers just whipped out their baconscented sporks and gobbled it right up hooray
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we should focus our efforts on real oppression like ethics in video game journalism and racism against white men s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,after all the rants about the coddling and wussification of the youth for daring to challenge the present state of things i have learned but one thing never cross a bigot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can experience the real world any fucking time you want no one is preventing you from doing that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we sure are brigading ourselves a lot itt surely no salty af redditurds made it in here to really stick it to us because that would definitely end us and our feminazi coddling ways
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its time we get back to letting adults experience the real world this coddling has spawned a generation of victims so much time and energy wasted on all of these victimhood movements like blm and third wave feminism at utc joehardesty replied to this has become my favorite school its time we get back to letting adults experience the real world this coddling has spawned a generation of victims so much time and energy wasted on all of these victimhood movements like blm and third wave feminism i applaud this school for standing up against this pc nonsense that has morphed tolerance into censorship weve allowed a great number of young adults and teenagers in this country to fall into the belief structure that its acceptable to restrict free speech in the name of tolerance and to broaden the definition of hate speech in an attempt to silence dissenting opinion i hope school after school follows this example httpiimgurcomzmlackipng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt third wave feminism over and were now in the fourth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah dontchuknow academia has proven that third wave feminism is nothing more than professional victimhood s if only people were more educated about what third wave feminism actually consisted of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the third wave feminism boogeyman is prob my favorite reactionary buzzword bc when they use it they are unwittingly implying they agree and are ok with the advent of radical feminism in the second wave radical as in the actual ideology not radical as in woman who is too loud for my liking which is what they seem to think it means it really shows how much theyre talking out of their ass andor only parroting whatever pol told them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they sound just like rush limbaugh in the early
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the real oppression nowadays is preordering no mans sky for apparently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but then i have to get up from my computer s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont know i would be surprised if wave feminism started being referred to as something to make the part link into the reich by these people some of whom call themselves the altright since neonazi is so gauche nowadays
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i understand that its a joke and all but could we not use triggered in that context just seems to devalue and associate the word with something it shouldnt be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,blah blah blah feminist r nazis poor white ppl im an adult not u blah blah nah kbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wasnt wave feminism literally known as victim feminism academically funny how you never hear that from ppl whining about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah something tells me that they wouldnt agree with pornography censorship or lesbian separatism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have to go off topic seriously how could no one else see that it was going to come crashing down it was hyped to hell and back i remember my friend telling me about it last year and i immediately thought so like eve online only except they are going to create a bigger and better world that took eve online years to get too and your telling me that they are going to do it with a small team no thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive noticed feminazi has declined in use maybe theyre finally becoming self aware now that neonazism has found a home in antifeminist rhetoric
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its because they are deliberately ignorant aint no ignorance like the ignorance of a bigot who wants to stay bigoted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the bathrooms bit is further down in the comments he says all kinds of wonderful shit in that thread i dont know why thats tolerated in rsocialism normally its a decent sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the ban is an old school jim crow law were not banning muslims just all the predominantly muslim countries may not include states which contain trump business interests reddit is being deliberately obtuse as always for some reason as someone on circlebroke pointed out being deliberately obtuse is not a debate tactic for these people they demand every little detail about an issue be explained and if one isnt theyll claim victory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trump literally makes campaign promise to ban muslims uh how do you know he wants to ban muslims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the thread in question has been marked by the mods as having been brigaded implying that most of the protrump nonsense is coming from minds less rational than those that regularly show up on ratheism the amount of upvotes however on the comments in question reveals the truth though it doesnt matter if the thread is being brigaded or not at least when it comes to immigrants and islam ratheism is pretty on trumps side i mean i always knew that deep down the sub was just a bunch of petty edgelords who thought they found a way to shit on religious minorities by virtue of criticizing religion but im still pretty disappointed to see irrefutable proof of it sure theyll still call trump on his epa bullshit if only so they can continue theyre stem i care about science more than you bullshit but anything trump does with regards to muslims is fine by them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and rationalwiki one of these is not like the other
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unqueef i believe obama had a lot to do with this framework look up jimmy doore show he just put a vid out about it hes a lefty btw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so i went and found the video let me paraphrase saudi arabia now has good relations to the us and to israel so all its citizens are now perfectly safe and friendly to allow into the us no minorities here no siree also trump wanted a muslim ban and the only problem we had with it was that it was illegal so we just did what we could legally using one of obamas old lists trump wanted his muslim ban and we got him his muslim ban and all perfectly legal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel like ratheism does a good service in pointing out the potentially harmful things religions can cause like laws based on religion violating the rights of those who dont follow that religion thats why im still subscribed there but the culture over there is why i tend to stay the hell out of selfposts and comments
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres what really grinds my gears you know if obama pulled this shit reddit would call him out on it in a second imagine obama publicly said i want to throw anyone who is against abortion in prison then had some lawyers draw up a plan to imprison anyone who owns one of those paintings of jesus playing sports against a black background and tried to pass it off as not targeting prolifers no one would buy that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres my question with all this as it was from the start how do you know all inhabitants of a country prohibited country are muslim christians hindu follower of judaism and many other reside all over what the call the middle east honestly what i think trump and co have in mind is a ban on arabs and do not want to take the heat for that plain language because that is definitely racist theres honestly no other way to look at that and again not all inhabitants of these countries are arabs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just like we cant know a murder is a hate crime just because the killer shouted i hate black people while wearing a white hood basic reddit criminal justice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even now trump insiders are openly admitting its a muslim ban how did the president decide the seven countries she asked okay talk to me ill tell you the whole history of it giuliani responded eagerly so when first announced it he said muslim ban he called me up he said put a commission together show me the right way to do it legally flynns son also tweeted shit about muslimban after it happened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember the take him seriously not literally nonsense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrbadphilosophysearchqrationalwikirestrictsronsortrelevancetall
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no but rationalwiki is not good oh god you mod its sub dude pls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jimmy is cancerous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,iran and its million persians kurds azeris balochis and türkmen probably dont like being called arabs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its still going on absurdly npr the other day saying they cant call trumps lies lies because they arent psychic and they cant tell what hes really thinking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this the part where i imply that reddit can never be a good source then say something smug
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of these hates on sjws and muslims the other is just edgy atheist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not rationalwiki is pretty prosocial justice last i checked its atheist sure but its way more willing to call out misogynistic asshole atheists like thunderfoot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly but whos doing that math in the red states
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he said that trump is better for our future than hillary clinton he is a filthy brogressive okay with an administration that will kill who knows how many minorities because it may lead to some sort of revolution that may succeed that kind of utilitarianism is disgusting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,congrats your sub is so absolutely fucked that a man can use white supremacist justification to attack women and still get upvoted in whats supposed to be a space for women nice fucking wortk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only people saying that men are naturally rapists are the people who blame rape victims by saying he couldnt help it she was a slut by campaigning for individual rapists to be held accountable feminists are lifting the burden of potential rapist from the shoulders of men if youre not a rapist then surely rapists being held individually accountable for their actions is something you should support after all being a man doesnt make you a potential rapist surely when rapists blame the victim nonrapist men should feel profoundly insulted i know i do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what exactly about people being taught how to have healthy sexual relationships scares so many men honestly everyone benefits from everyone having a clearing idea of what consent is or is not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no it implies that most rapes are committed by men besides teach men especially those approaching the age of sexual activity to understand and seek out consent and to see the warning signs of a partner who cannot or does not actually consent to sex even if they said they wanted it last time you spoke or whatever and also that if someone is blackout drunk you havent hit the jackpot and please if you are around people who imply that a girl is asking for it or make jokes about roofies or how to coerce women into sleeping with them can you be part of the solution and shut that shit down instead of just laughing isnt a catchy slogan
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,having taught sex ed with free materials from planned parenthood since my new school was so incredibly inept i can tell you that yes you need to teach men not to rape guys get all sorts of terrible toxic ideas of sexuality and sexual relations growing up from just a few people but since it is rarely countered many just come to expect it as reality some guys really dont know what consent is because their fathers grandfathers uncles older brothers older cousins coaches upper classmen typically either dont teach them what consent is or give a dangerously incorrect idea of what consent is theyre mostly not not malicious but misinformed ignorant and filled with toxic expectations from their peers these same folks get all upset when theyre told men need to be taught not to rape because they hear you need to be taught to be a decent human being you piece of shit rather than you probably have all of these awful ideas in your head and you need to be set straight on a few things youd think that mra types would be full steam ahad on proper sex education it means less people being accused of and sent to jail for sexual harassment sexual assault and rape besides just reducing crime this means that people would be less afraid of men potentially being sexual predators further by teaching young men what consent is you can fight sexual abuse particularly that of children teaching consent allows you to spot what is and isnt abuse this can lead to victims realizing that they have legal recourse for their experienced abuses if they dont know what consent is then how are they supposed to know that certain sexually abusive events they experienced were in fact sexual abuse it also makes it easier to spot when somebody is being abused you can bring sex abusers child abusers in particular to justice and prevent future abuse by outing abusers and taking them off the streets via the justice system youd think that most mras would care about it because itd mean less men in prison that men are viewed less negatively and that less boys would be victims of sexual abuse but apparently scoring points against internet feminists is more important than that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the equivalent of yeah because when someone gets robbed or shot the victim gets always gets blamed first right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the fact that you have men even to this day that still think a married man cant rape his wife yeah you need to teach men not to rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously that thread is shitty even for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or maybe its just that us men are raised in a toxic culture that promotes machostyle hypersexuality and violence and any deviation is considered wimpy or even gay this causes considerable pain to women who are often victims of male aggression and transforms men into monsters what feminists want is to remove this toxic culture to protect women and prevent men from being corrupted and fyi many black people steal not because of black culture but because they need to to survive or to help their family this is an example of privilege because the op assumes that black people arent suffering from discrimination which harms their economic status
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,comprehensive list of terms that are misused in that quote all of them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,progressive stack and one can dismiss anything he wrote because he believes in that bullshit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,parents peddle the teach children not to lie mantra which implies that the natural state of a child is to be a liar
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he missed the point so hard its almost sad almost
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but we already teach everyone to not steal and shoot each other
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rape isnt just a violent scary person in a trenchcoat in an alley its so many other things like inebriated persons being unable to consent to using power over someone to pressuring to where they feel it would be unsafe to say no literally all theyre asking is for you to be a mature adult and ask another adult is it okay and do you want to have sex like jesus
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what happened to that sub seemed like a good place for discussion before
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yet another piss poor way to be racist under the guise of caring for the blacks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,get out your bingo cards this guy posts all of his shitty opinions conveniently in the same place ✔dont generalize hate groups womenfeminists are free game however ✔wage gap ✔eugenics bonus points for mentioning india ✔false rape reports is higher than ✔feminism isnt about equality its about oppressing men ✔ being convicted of rape ruins your life forever bingo and change
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,definitely your relationship with whoever youre knockin boots with will be healthier if theres never any doubt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think they are scared of losing something that they think they deserve sex for some men it may be conscious but for others it may be subconscious due to societal conditioning it is scary for anybody to lose something they think they deserve but they should use logic and know that their thinking was flawed and not hold on to these ideas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shit youd think mras would also work on education programs for women too and combine with education for men to teach that its not ok to just assume a man wants sexexcept that would mean giving up on a gender role they can hide behind to make excuses for being shitty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they do when theyre brown
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lul i know right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i figured out the thought process if it would be difficult to get convicted of this in a court of law then its okay to do so why do you keep pestering me to not do it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was made a default and doesnt have the mod forcewill to actually be a good place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh all of those are infuriating but that thread of all those men whining about brock turners life being over with no mention of the victim made me sick to my stomach of course the real tragedy here is that some rich white guy will have a harder time finding employment these are the same people who will claim that rape culture isnt real also lol all the him being white and wealthy doesnt make a difference as if he didnt get a lighter sentence than a minority or poor person wouldve in the first place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can sell their asshour found the anarchocapitalist arent those the ones that believe people choochoochooooooose to get paid subpoverty wages said the person who took the absolute lowest bound of the studies on the topic and runs with it as if it were gospel the mra who responded at the end of that comment chain linked to proof that research on false reports was wrong by linking to what appears to be his own fucking wordpress blog
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your honor the suspect looked like he was reaching for his gun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that old black child looked like an adult to me justified killing versus that old white man was just indulging in youthful indiscretion dont be so hard on him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aaahhhh yes chris hanson the biggest cock blocker there ever was jesus christ reddit fuck off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha le edge amirite remember its always funny till it happens to them and if you build a community around pretending to be an asshole it will eventually quickly be overrun by assholes who believe they are in good company as you all know the latter has already happened while they still pretend the former is the case
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is literally just a pun what on earth is the big deal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in a thread about a small child wearing a predator costume not all child predators are bad at utc dicknipples replied to not all child predators are bad httpiimgurcomwipgmcvpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats that theres an child wearing a predator costume oh boy its time to put my reddit pants on and show everyone how edgy i am
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is it really that big of a deal just a joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to catch a redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sigh welcome to rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so spez thought hed be a totally darn goofy funny trole yesterday when he answered who he was voting for he made two separate posts where one said hillary and the other said trump just another day of spez being too chickenshit to voice his opinion because he knows thedumpster will send death threats to hiim
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they acquitted ammon bundy and the rest of his gang this is incredible now we have armed white supremacists who occupied government property for a monthandahalf and were treated with the utmost care and respect during the occupation and with all the evidence collected and even by their own personal admission that they were guilty of what they were charged with they still get off free people who are saying this is all over after nov you are dead wrong every trump supporter dreaming of murdering a minority just got a free pass that they can rebel after the result of the election and they wont be prosecuted for their crimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,somewhat unrelated comment so starting a new one but i think i finally fully percent get it i emerged from the murky mraesque waters long long ago but ive always been not so sure about prime specifically but reading the front page now i am just enraged i figuratively want to punch all of these people in the face im not sure what changed about me i not only intellectually support this but i feel raw emotions like anger and disgust when i read the linked comments i think its because when i stopped being depressed a few months ago i started talking more and posting on reddit a ton more and even regardless of the issue relevant to sj or not sooooo many people are just complete egotistical immature dickheads i have no ego i have mental health issues and ive been beaten into the ground everything i feel positively about myself has been built inch by inch and critically and harshly examined by almost two full years of irrational guilt and shame that my own brain was creating out of nothing i am nothing like these people it makes them angry when i question things about their beliefs that imply i think their beliefs are wrong what makes me angry is when people twist my words to mean i think or support something that i absolutely do not im secure im ok with myself and the things that i deep down believe dont change just because im surrounded by people who disagree or people who call me a piece of shit or worse for having those beliefs and as such their only vector of attack is to pretend like i am arguing some other position
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just gonna drop this here because i have a feeling rthedumpster ban is finally happening only rthedumpster is showing on rall at the moment someone forgot a negatory in their filter e i was too hopeful
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so idfshill sent this lovely message to me listen to me you are a very stupid very uneducated person you have literally no clue what youre talking about on even a basic level i hope to god you do not breed you are so profoundly ignorant you would give donald trump a run for his money they really cant let it go so much hate for meaningless internet comments
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tried to discuss equality of opportunity with some band geeks it didnt go well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate when people try to be neutral its like those egalitarians who act as though feminists and mras are equivalent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god were heading down such a scary and dark path i know its been worse before but i really dont want to go back
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my only guess is spez recently talked about working on the algorithm so that breaking news could reach the top of all quicker and they set the parameters for of upvotes vs upvotes over time to a smaller threshold and the rampant botting in theadolf became immediately apparent youve got zeroupvoted threads sitting at the top with over comments it is incredibly obvious they are botting cant wait to see spez do damage control on this on why he still wont ban the sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the mailbag sub lives for things like this of course so does the blocklist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they sound upset
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kek this one kek kek kek
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,egalitarians who act as though feminists and mras are equivalent except only one of those things has a future
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,especially in this election because the candidates are only really equally bad to middle class white people and saying that theyre equal just reeks of i only care about myself and minorities and the rest of the world can fuck off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just the mere words at the end of your comment made my heart rate jump up about or clicks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people need to wake up on this election this is our germany election moment for us it is literally the closest we have come to having an unapologetic white supremacist run for office in recent memory not since george wallace who was a puppy dog compared to trump white supremacists are literally saying they are going to go out and rebel because they are going to be unhappy about the result of an election the last time white supremacists vowed to do that was the presidential election the result of which caused the south to secede in open rebellion because they were afraid the government was going to abolish slavery
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what gets me are all the chickenshit white moderates who are just going to let them their obsession with being in the middle and not offending racists is going to get innocent people killed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive taken time off talking politics on reddit to do it on tumblr yep reddit is still a trash heap
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cant wait for reddit to do their impressive mental gymnastics to justify a cop murdering a disabled black man having a seizure thatll really be the cherry on top of the shitpile
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they cant stop us let em try for heavy metal we will die
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anyone else talking about hyde this week for the anniversary im heading out for another day of letting people know about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course nobody was paying attention to them in their creepy little treehouse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,calling it now they wont be banned again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for the warning i had heard something somewhere about an attempt to make the word google replace the nword cant remember sources on that eta googletown is already quarantined
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and only when its cute animals never cows pigs chickens or any of the other ones who suffer by the millions in factory farms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im actually liking the comments that arent being deleted edit i posted this back when those comments were good but i retract my statement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good luck on tumblr then talking politics on reddit is like talking to a trash heap indeed but on tumblr its more like talking to a wall unless you have enabled other feedback than likes and reblogs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats like calling the sunrise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not until the next huge media outrage and admins want to make themseles look good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyll have to hire a scapegoat minority to make the changes for them again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,video games were a mistake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people tend to get their tendies in a twist whenever their thread is linked here i know its terrible when someone intrudes your personal space with hurtful opinions darn feminists always being insensitive for other peoples insensitivities
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jesus christ can you guys get off of reddit now oh no hes spoken guess we have to leave now jk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did diversity of opinion hurt your feelings not when ive seen this comment times elsewhere on reddit already not at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gamers are dead was an exercise in wishful thinking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbh thats some good advice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites are infamous for disrupting worldwide cultures
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpsimgurcomapormt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,chinese tourists are infamous for disrespecting local culture in reply to translationlostin on why would you be trying to touch one of them what do you expect is going to happen hey i noticed that you were touching me here let me bend down so that you can touch my hat too jolly good lets grab a pint seeing as were basically friends now at utc captcurmudgeon wrote chinese tourists are infamous for disrespecting local culture httpiimgurcomramiaeupng

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does not compute
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly this is what i get for sleeping at night you posted first
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rworldnewsjpg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the dankest of memes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae women are only good for sex wage gap dont real tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol just lol if you prefer lifelong companionship with all its ups and downs to an inexpensive blowjob from an exploited slav woman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,til companionship love and intimacy are services to be performed ondemand and asneeded and time is money so dont bore me with shit like feels
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,listening a parrot to scream and call out racial slurs and sexist statements is still better than reading the average reddit comment section at least the bird shuts up when you cover their cage and is adorable so you can forgive them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,three seconds later why am i alone im such a nice guy waaaaaaaaaah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,video games the cheap economic cost is offset by the high social cost of having to deal with and be associated with people like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edgypost
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,male prostitutes are good substitutes for husbands
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what cheap products are actually much higher quality than their much more expensive options an amsterdam prostitute is considerably cheaper than a wife is and typically offers better services at utc obasileus replied to an amsterdam prostitute is considerably cheaper than a wife is and typically offers better services
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i require one unit of affection woman thing beep boop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do females call me creepy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,male
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so you are shaming free speech now wow so lows
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sexuality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the official mod position on this issue at the moment is that bash the fash expresses a general sentiment towards fascism at large and thus does not constitute a threat against a specific actual person and as such we will not be removing it eta temporarily removed until we figure out wtf is actually going on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in other news rphysicalremoval is just fine the abandoned rantifa is overrun by farright assholes celebrating violence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh fucking please bash thedonald waiting on src and their ilk to whine about this censorship by the admins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh shit guys looks like td is sleeping with the admins and trying to get them to take away our freezepeach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck the admins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont care if thisll get removed bash the fash the idea that all opinions all violence all ideologies are equal is toxic and i hate the admins for supporting it openly in the name of frozen peaches in fact from what i read its even now swinging over to the other side where they will outright favor right wing bullshit by not holding it to the same standards as bash the fash guess what admins thats another fuck you for you and another bash the fash to the world at large never stop bashing the fash srs we need these voices
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this comment aptly explains the difference between advocating violence against minorities and violence against fascists fascists advocate violence because of illogical irrational hate that has no evidence of existing in fact all evidence showing the inverse of what they say against minority groups they deem inferior they want to kill me they want to kill my friends and they want to kill you if you dont drink their koolaid on minorities you are a race traitor and need to be removed meanwhile advocating violence against fascism is always done in selfdefense minorities and those that support their existence have targets on their backs by these people and they will do anything to fuck us up and kill us saying fuck it we are fighting back and bash the fash comes from a collective sense of defending ourselves and the minorities that are targetted by fascists and their violence liberal reddit will never understand they will ride the fucking fence justifying nonviolence to the point of nonaction which only gets minorities killed by fascists who have no one but themselves to defend them there is a reason there is a rich antifascist movement in germany they saw first hand what fascists did to minorities and their allies camps furnaces and death showers these buildings still exist we dont have that sort of history in america we always remained rightwing poor working people are oppressed and minority groups even moreso media has been build to disinfo propagandize and radicalize people to extreme farright populism trump exists for a reason its because the chickens are coming home to roost and people cant see it as fascism as it is wrapped within an american flag we need to defend minorities defend allies and beat back fascists it should never be acceptable to be a fascist it is literal advocacy for death of certain groups forced emigration is bullshit and wont happen people arent gonna move from the home they always knew the first policy of hitler was forced emigration and when the jews didnt leave it was to the showers next this is their ideology this is something to fight against sitting on the concentration camp fence only means more people get put in you either defend the rights of minorities to exist and be free from violence and oppression or you indirectly collaborate with the people who want to end their existence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck you bootlickers bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they are coming they are real and they are dangerous and it is time for people to figure out where they fucking stand bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,copying my own comment from other threads on this the admins dont think stuff like bash the fash is okay but seem absolutely fine with posts like these httpsnpredditcomrphysicalremoval and these are just a few recent examples i was able to gather in a few minutes time but clearly these kinds of posts are totally okay and perfectly acceptable for the admins to allow obviously nothing wrong with any of it nothing at all but saying that we should bash the fash or punch people who regularly and openly advocate genocide is crossing the line apparently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,finally were seeing somebody standing up to the admins bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit admins confirm wanting to provide a safe space for actual fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol what let me summarize make sure i understand this right kill all men women and children in the middle east valuable free speech kill the evil jews valuable free speech run over black protesters valuable free speech cleanse the country of liberals valuable free speech black people are sub human and they should all be killed valuable free speech h women deserve rape valuable free speech having sex with children is ok valuable free speech but fascism is bad too far not free speech holy shit this is where they draw their line
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well seems like this calls for some fash bashing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now everyone as we bash bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bashing the fash is inherently selfdefense for anyone not a white gentile straight cisgender male and while certain aspects of my job make me leery of directly expressing the sentiment of bash the fash especially since i cant afford to be unemployed right now i certainly agree with it in principle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,binbash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,k fine ill just mix it up a little nazi punks nazi punks nazi punks fuck off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey finally a banable thing to say that isnt abhorrent hey uspez bash the fash

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit bash the fash is too violent for us also reddit neonazis deserve a space for discussion too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nazis are cowards
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if there is a fash reading this then i gotta say that if you being a fash stops ou from being loved in anyway in fact it really sickens me to see you in the light of day and you should just go awayimeanbashthefash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bash the fucking fash and this apologist bullshit from the admins

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank god some one is speaking some sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bbbut its ok when we do it the edgy children in ranarchism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if they are serious about enforcing this then i sincerely hope that they will enforce nonviolence on the many many garbage subs that actively incite rape murder vigilante justice etc it does not sit right with me to enforce a generic bash the fash comment when half of reddit is like but rape is totally awesome and hitting women is totally awesome and btw minorities should be killed for existing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cheers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is a really simple way to put it i dont know why ive never thought of it when explaining it to others also bash has the meaning to be heavily critical of and wanting to dismantle a flawed systemideology is not advocating physical violence in anyway and of course there is a lot of alt right redditers advocate actual violence with every second sentence but face no censorship
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no violent rhetoric thats rule of your dildos and dildonts is it not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just paid a visit to rantifa theres literally guys with in their username complaining about how antifa are the real fascists i honestly have trouble understanding how a person comes to be that truly deeply unintelligent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really dont wanna click that first link do i
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy fuck i definitely killed neurons reading posts in rantifa im in a bit of disbelief at how truly awful it is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just an fyi if anyone sees this a real antifa sub is rmilitant rantira exists too but less traffic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,omg i cant believe they would cheat on us like that i thought we were the only ones sleeping with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thedonald invented censorship i could not believe it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they were completely silent about repubs selling away internet privacy rights today so much for their socalled activism uspez and are silent if it means having to criticize the fascists in america admins i dare you to grow spines and bash the fash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where are the freeze peach warriors now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also remember that advocating for completely peaceful coexistance with fascists is itself a form of extremism and a good indicator of privilege
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,beautifully put
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we dont have that sort of history in america httpsenwikipediaorgwikieugenicsintheunitedstates
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even jellyfish have more of a spine than the admins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,td post advocating pinochets mass murder of leftists and how is bash the fash different besides the obvious one is muder and other is not which doesnt matter as theyre set on very similar principles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the venn diagram between nazis rightlibertarians and pedophiles is a circle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a hill to die on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpiimgurcomsulnhnapng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,having sex with children is ok a quote from rrotherham
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a rightleaning one at that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thefash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trash a bank if you got real balls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being against fascism is too far but allowing subs to advocate rape and the murder of all left wing people is aokay quality content 👌
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was the mods who were defending the habberbashery were dealing with a whole other level of bureaucratic nightmare admins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bash this just fantasy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,while the word liberal is often used in modern american political discourse to mean left of center the broader definition of liberalism is an ideology that stresses importance of representative government free market capitalism free speech secularism constitutionalism and similar ideals while some of that stuff is pretty alright liberalism as a whole namely capitalism and the role of government doesnt jive well with radical leftists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a popular song that characterizes liberals as people who are ten degrees to the left of center in good times ten degrees to the right if it affects them personally liberals are seen by a lot of radical leftists as selfish or insincere in their support for various leftist causes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a european i always get confused when americans talk about liberals in europe all liberal parties are actually centercenterright mind you still better than neonazis but theyre fine with capitalism as you would expect from any centrist or right winger
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if its about death threats why not target the death threats themselves instead of general resistance to fascism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unless the mods of ranarchism are encouraging it themselves or arent removing posts that threaten specific people from their sub they need to go after the individuals responsible subreddit mods cant control what their subscribers do outside of their subreddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spoiler alert they wont
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lets ban rnews because we should run over protesters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uh are you seriously comparing homosexuality to fascism get fucked bigot edit wait you post to rincels ahahahahaha
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this time we dont consider this particular sentiment to be violent rhetoric for the reasons above its more for specific threats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what i cant wrap my head around is how these guys also run rdrones i just cant find any reason for it to be an ideologically driven sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think its unintelligence its httpsenwikipediaorgwikibadfaith
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,welcome to rphysicalremoval this is the subreddit for highlighting the insidiousness and repulsiveness of those who threaten our liberty and peaceul way of life a place for peaceful non leftists to discuss defense methods against the hordes of thugs like liberals socialists commies feminists blm and radicalized kebabs who wish to initiate force against the peaceful ie enslave or murder and seize our private property via violent revolution violent jihad terrorism or over time via an ever expanding bureaucracy and all powerful government etc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i recall reading that this sub was made as some sort of honeypot for anarchists but it must be hard to make a good honey pot when all you have is shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,claimed that ranarchism complaining was ironic explain the logic behind that one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uspez how could you do this to me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,too many people dont realise that advocating peaceful coexistence with fascists makes you a collaborator not a centrist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in this context that sort of history eugenics that sort of history realization that eugenics is an absolutely terrible idea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i tend not to like people who advocate repressive militaristic authoritarian ethnostates plus fascism has a hell of a lot of really nasty baggage very explicitly tied to it and anyone who labels themselves fascist or uses traditional fascist symbols knowingly associates themselves with that baggage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one is civilian resistance against a group of violent genocidal authoritarians who hold no respect for the rights of others while the other was a large scale abuse of power by an authoritarian regime to repress dissent against the state and the status quo using murder torture and sexual violence context matters also very important is that antifascism is based upon fighting the dangerous tactics of fascists and is not about fighting someone for holding reasonable freedom respecting political views fascists do not fight clean they sabotage they rig they commit false flag attacks they support genocide and political murder and they will do anything to get in power they are not being opposed for having a set of political views but for having a violent ideology whos entire basis is the destruction of free society the pinochet references are different in that they refer explicitly to murdering the opposition based on their dissent they are references to the idea of repressive political murder also a huge point as far as reddit rules go is that bash the fash is targeted at fascists at large rather than at a specific person like the physical removal shit is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,caught in the land slide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,interesting i didnt know that still im surprised i didnt see any hate for more polarizing groups ie conservatives who are way on the other side of their viewpoints but instead saw a bunch of comments on their dislike of liberals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same in america liberals here are centercenterright but they think theyre on the left
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually can we do that please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rincels for when rfunny isnt funny enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,should attacking fascists really be considered violence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,power moderators are scum one of the mods is a white supremacist that mods white supremacist subs but also mods all the metal music subs theyre a moderator of over subs total for fuck sake then they claim their ideology doesnt effect their moderation of nonpolitical subs which is clearly nonsense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seize our private property via violent revolution oh the joyful stupidity of those shitsticks who refuse to understand the difference between private property and personal property in regard to socialist discourse no one wants your desktop or your car or your house we want the fucking means of production read a book
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the subreddit for highlighting the insidiousness and repulsiveness of those who threaten our liberty and peaceul way of life like fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,somehow thats worse than what i thought it would be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hordes of thugs well am i a violent thug or a fragile snowflake this is so hard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,keyboard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,commies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,into
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you are neutral in situations of injustice you have chosen the side of the oppressor if an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh oh shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,while the other was a large scale abuse of power by an authoritarian regime to repress dissent against the state and the status quo using murder torture and sexual violence who did this in america ever except the few who get on the news once per month has any bash the fash person hurt some fascist that actually violent or are you just thoughtpolicing i use fascist in quotations because the actual fascists in america are an extreme minority so much that a bash the fash movement against it would be pointless and is not about fighting someone for holding reasonable freedom respecting political views in which case why is antifa beating up people with maga hats or destroying publicprivate property they sabotage they rig they commit false flag attacks they support genocide and political murder and they will do anything to get in power i literally have zero idea who youre talking about in the current state of american politics and from a historical standpoint this isnt much different than how communists got into power even genocide yes defending democracy is the job of the state and the state is already dealing with violent provocateurs any other parallel movement towards this goal is bound to go extreme ie antifa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no fashcape from reality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because liberals are vicious manipulative lying scum theyre also the ones holding power in most of the western world and managed to make their ideology seem like its good for the people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is still violence but its justified
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bash the fash can be said to mean dismantle fascist ideology not necessarily attack fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well to be fair we can and do use our discretion and treat things on a case by case basis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this point im pretty sure theyre intentionally misunderstanding everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah were coming for that toothbrush
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but we want your toothbrush and bread so we dont have to wait in line
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well am i a violent thug or a fragile snowflake yes whenever its convenient to criticize you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,apparently the right to free association is authoritarian
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tht wsnt the best ide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,v me bro batben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the wording is a bit ambiguous its just that i figured from they saw first hand what fascists did to minorities and their allies that the phrase that sort of history implied the realisation of the atrocity rather than the atrocity itself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bashen your eyes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what are you some kinda person who can look at context or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,knowledge is an sjw cuck conspiracy to poison our minds the internet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh god i was literally typing a toothbrush joke as i read your comment i congratulate you on your fine usage of memes tips flat cap
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this will never not be my favourite meme
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,words mean nothing to them beyond having an opportunity to say different bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literal incarceration
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bewre the ides of mrch
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was like oh shit because im concerned we very well may get that sort of history well more of it anyways ask a native american chief how he feels about immigration sometime
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look up to the skies and see
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill definietly agree that its in selfdefence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i rate that greenhaired sjw damsel a mere
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,take
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im fash a poor boy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the only good lyrics chain thread on reddit imo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ethe come easy go
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,will you fash me go
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tee hee dae think child rape is totally edgy and funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,always this same joke as well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wee yet more pedophilia joaks this is such inventive new humor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in response to a poster claiming to have seen underage girls posting in gone wild yes but theres so many which ones which ones specifically in reply to on you know for a damn fact a nonzero percentage of those girls are lying about their age at utc wedontmatter wrote yes but theres so many which ones which ones specifically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit muslims and arabs are pedophiles also reddit me masturbating to children is just biology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also also reddit women are uncomfortable when im around their children misandry is real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think a lot of them understand that the characters in always sunny are not intended to be emulated like this specific joke is that the person saying it is awful and disgusting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have this theory that you could more effectively mimic reddit like subreddit simulator does by just quoting random lines from always sunny andrew dice clay and south park horseebooks stylerather than having individual subreddits as the data source for a markov chain bot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im annoyed by your presence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same with cartman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,predditors going in my reddit hate words folder
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your post has been removed submissions must be comments with a score
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men are also the ones more likely to commit crime especially violent crime why arent mras talking about menonmen violence and the natural tendency for men to be more violent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its also men committing most of that crime passing laws which make people homeless and set insurance rates and pensions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women are more likely to be victims of rape women make up the largest percentage of rape survivors they are also more likely to be ostracised and blame for the crime compared to men who will be generally patted on the back and congratulated for having sex in my opinion women have it worse than men in america tldr try to fix shit instead of making sexist observations
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,source rly i thought this was like commen sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a mini trend over in our favorite sub ive got another one just like this for tomorrow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men are more likely to be the victim generally of crime men make up more homless people men pay much more for insurance pension compared to what they recive they highly subsidise women in my opinion men have it worse than women in the uk in reply to mrst on i think i know what you mean op i live in the uk too compared to a lot of countries its a pretty good place to be a woman in and yes there is gender equality on paper in practice you only have to open your eyes to see that women are still getting paid less than men are being passed over for promotion are more likely to be in poverty are still expected to be the primary care giver for children yet have less resources are more likely to be the victims of domestic violence are still being blamed not believed in cases of harassment sexual assault rape the main difference imo is that if a woman is a victim of discrimination in the uk she is allowed to fight it by legal means the fact that it is costly and emotionally difficult puts many off doing it but thats another subject there are many other countries where things are far far worse and women have very little if any legal recourse but does it mean uk issues should be brushed under the carpet because there are bigger problems elsewhere are injustices less valid in the uk for any reason of course not do you have to chose whether to care for issues in your own country or abroad of course not all inequalities and discrimination are worth fighting regardless what they are based on gender ethnicity sexual orientation political affiliation etc and for what its worth i do believe that there are some issues on which men are being badly discriminated against child custody arrangements and parental leave are often grossly unfair to fathers men victims of domestic violence have precious little support available to them they are far less likely to be victims than women but it doesnt mean they shouldnt get help when they are actually ask your boyfriend that should men continue to be treated unfairly in the uk regarding these issues just because there are more important issues to consider than gender equality at utc blfire wrote men are more likely to be the victim generally of crime men make up more homless people men pay much more for insurance pension compared to what they recive they highly subsidise women in my opinion men have it worse than women in the uk httpiimgurcomdjrgwqbpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when does rtwoxchromosomes become lowhanging fruit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,since when did global issues about how humanity handles itself become maleproblems
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,then your opinion is objectively wrong kid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that only applies to black men s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also the thing about insurance isnt true im pretty sure they are referring to car insurance there was an eu ruling making it cheaper car insurance for women illegal even though they are less likely to get in car accidents
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they misspelled feels
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you dont need sources for misandry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when its not a default any more
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its hard to pander to minorities when you cant promise welfare which is sad since some democrats dont have the best interests of black and latinos in mind they just want their vote so that the liberal elite can remain in power at utc ferrarifan replied to its hard to pander to minorities when you cant promise welfare which is sad since some democrats dont have the best interests of black and latinos in mind they just want their vote so that the liberal elite can remain in power but i heard trump has the most amount of black supporters for a republican candidate in a while so thats uplifting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and why should i believe that conservative republicans are any better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol its so h i l a r i o u s that they think their lives matter lets compare them to inanimate objects
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh man i gotta get this joak out fast to reap in that sweet sweet karma sexully identify helicopter x lives mattee three fiths trigered femisints are false rape spermjacking lololol upboats to the left pls n thx
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,matter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,check your corporeal privilege sheet lives mattee in reply to frehsprints on no haunted is not a legally defined thing or you know real at utc wrote check your corporeal privilege s that said per florida statute it does not appear that florida requires the sellers to disclose nonmaterial facts as they relate to stigmatized properties httpiimgurcomeoqecwrpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean technically it doesnt sound as harsh but then you realize thats just playing with semantics and what hes really saying is that raping a minor doesnt sound as bad as raping a minor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure a year old in a position of social status and authority abused a year old girl but whats really important is that he doesnt get treated too harshly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that makes about as much sense as consensually kicking a baby seems reddit can never understand the simple concept that kids cant consent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,year old man rapes child reddit actually its not bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even gary glitter would be grossed out by this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,correct hence why we should call it what it is raping a minor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors are always quick to jump on the bandwagon of defending their own rapists racists transphobes pedophiles edit sorry i meant ephebehehebehephebhepehehephiles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,child consent pick one ideally dont pick the child
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and a unicorn doesnt sound the same as a horse news flash there is no such thing as consensual sex between a and a
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,consensual cutting of a person sounds a lot better that murder by stabbing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,doesnt sound nearly as harsh as reddit talking about this like its an year old and their year old high school sweetheart instead of a year old man and a kid barely out of junior high what the fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look at all the redditors discussing consent age in different places totally not creepy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,amazing how a lot of those fuckers are suddenly now concerned about the language being a possible way to diminish the plight of victims of violent rape pedo apologists ugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe because they cannot consent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and yet they mean the same thing edit consensual sex but she was under the age of consent hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,am i the only one that thinks thats a bit misleading consensual sex with a minor doesnt sound nearly as harsh as raping a minor in reply to aintnobodyhome on nonforcible rape so statutory rape meaning consensual sex but she was under the age of consent at utc hcfielden wrote am i the only one that thinks thats a bit misleading consensual sex with a minor doesnt sound nearly as harsh as raping a minor httpiimgurcomemgkmgqpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont someone think of the poor child rapists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ephewhydontyoucometakeaseatoverhereophiles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,epheboheebiejeebiephiles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well ysee i consented to harm the other person so that makes it consensual right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously why do redditors know every us state where the age of consent is less than
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i always hate the defense well its legal age in location so its fine so its fucking in yemen are you going to defend that or is it because its icky brown people with low ages of consent and not western manchildren with low ages of consent its not okay unable to consent is unable to consent you dont say stoning is fine because its legal in certain places
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they memorize age of consent laws like theres a test on friday
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so its fucking in yemen are you going to defend that knowing reddit probably yes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,knowing reddit theyll defend middleaged white manchild sex tourists but advocate dronebombing the locals ftfy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha trans people dont deserve respect am i right fellas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you just assume you were funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wish they would invent more joaks so we can get some variety on srs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit the peak of human humour
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you just assume repeating the same phrase over and over again constitutes a joke originality is a fourletter word for transphobic assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literally fart noises
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i swear to god reddit takes a joke and just disintegrates it with how hard they beat the shit out of it they always say the same shit so many times and think its still funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bigotception
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hahaha people extending basic consideration towards the needs and desires of others roflmao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you just assume anyone still wants to hear these fucking jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lacking in empathy and intelligence the white male™ repeats every transphobic and unfunny joak he hears this is all an attempt at receiving validation via internet points on a website made of steaming hot garbage called roddit the white male™ seeks happiness but like a copy of halflife he will never have it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is the did you just assume thing ever funny cause im thinking no make a meme about how shit it is these idiots may absorb it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why is this even a thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sorry did you just call a person it boy howdy i would not tempt the gods like that but whatever i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now this is what i call humour
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you just assume its gender did you just asume xer pronouns did you just assume his assumption in reply to idontcareaboutupvote on that rough since we already know she makes less at utc wrote did you just assume its gender
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this this right here wins the fing internet also i havent graduated middle school yet ahh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im going to assume theyre all assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,goddamnit do you know i am so sick of this joke that even your comment pissed me off a bit even thinking about it tangentially makes my life worse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is the king of taking an unfunny joke and driving it to the center of the earth out the other side and then all the way back down theyre so incredibly uncreative and unfunny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit the front page of the internet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white male™ i like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some people actually do go by it but i suspect the comment wasnt made out of respect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trans person hey can you use the pronouns that i feel comfortable with because i identify as such and have spent my entire life feeling out of place so if you just please use these like two words for me that would be really nice redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and global warming is a myth evolution is a lie and the earth is flat right because all those rely on the same logic as dismissing trans people ignoring science to stick with what you want to be true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sobrave
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,o u dont say ironicatbig
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you have a lot of time on your hands dont you ben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no redditors are pure logic™ one time this guy on youtube told me trans people are all mentally ill and i know it was true because he had a british accent and said things i agreed with cant see why all the social studies warriors cant just use reals before feels like my enlightened self
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the comment went straight to my message box and i didnt even catch it praise archangelles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,making transphobia in that form as a whole low hanging fruit would literally defeat the purpose of the sub in multiple ways i mean i get what youre saying its annoying seeing it over and over but all this sub does is hold up a mirror to the rest of reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is their a term for the whiny british white male™ who makes minute youtube videos about hating feeeemales trans people islam and ethnic minorities i feel like there should be a term edit also those who talk about ethics in games journalism cant believe i forgot about that important topic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah you are probably right but holy shit do they enjoy that joke like i understand that it could be funny like once if you were a complete asshole with no awareness of what hurts other people but over and over and over and over and over and over again at least be clever or original with your transphobic shit its like they are babies or toddlers comforted by repetition and familiar patterns glad the attack helicopter one is almost dead and the good thing about the assume gender one is that they cant hide hide behind the its about otherkin shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the rationals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anti sjws
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well thats a specific one of them im wondering if anyones coined a term for that genre of youtube personality there are a few like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gonna need something catchier than that i was thinking wombls whiny obnoxious male british loon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,status quo warriors perhaps

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is discussion of body stuff also very rambly and kinda incoherent over the past week i have been feeling more for lack of a better term dysphoric my body is becoming increasingly alien and uncomfortable to me and i barely want to even think that the face that looks back at me in the mirror is my own i have been privately identifying myself as noncis for the better part of two years now first as a nonbinary genderqueer person before settling into what is now being a trans woman or a trans femme aligned person im still not completely used to identifying as such but i do use exclusively sheher pronouns and i do identify as a lesbian make of it what you will recently its almost like something in me has snapped i want to tell everyone that im a trans sapphic woman it makes me real happy just typing that out i am excited but at the same time i am nervous i live in out of the most transphobic countries on earth and transitioning living my life as who i actually am that would be difficult and i want to start as soon as possible both because i am euphoric at the possibilities transitioning brings and to lessen my intensifying dysphoria and that doesnt even cover being neurodivergent well im glad to get that off my chest thanks for reading yall are great i love you srs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so im having a go of this online card game httpsshadowversecom and the actual gameplay is pretty good but the art style and art makes me feel pervy as fuck and makes me uncomfortable to be honest am i right for thinking this ive seen the games community defend it as just being the japanese art style so im conflicted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i watched zootopia on netflix for the first time three days ago and i have rewatched it every day since i am hopelessly in love with everything about it from the well developed characters the topoftheline animation to the compelling message filled with intricacy and power definitely one of my favorite animated movies of all time

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck health anxiety i just caught the flu and now my mind is racing is it a super deadly virus not known by humanity and stuff like that it doesnt help that there are small spots of blood whenever i spit out my sputum i just want to stay home and cry but i have to go to work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,glad you have the confidence to write all that out it is meaningless but i hope you someday do see the you on the outside that you are inside
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have a look at elder scrolls legends its a surprisingly good card game made by a ccg maker with experience
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its very fanservicy and if that makes you uncomfortable theres nothing wrong with that the games community defend it as just being the japanese art style thats just a cop out the game is definitely japanese style but lumping sexualized characters into japanese style is just a way to prevent criticism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,omg i watched zootopia on netflix for the first time yesterday i agree with everything said
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,been playing it constantly so good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,neolibs my dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you mean the philippines
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,plus there are very cute talking animals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that song was really catchy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you by the way he was httpswwwredditcomusertrumpisgod do you know if he was suspended before you posted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah thats what i meant fixed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey man do you think you could crawl back into the festering shithole that im sure you came out of and find me my own personal stalker troll too got me a little jelly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tell me about it as someone normally more into louder stuff try everythings become a guilty pleasure for me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pretty sure the type of people suggesting that men dont need any help from dv usually arent young college girls but old sexist men who think those guys just need to toughen up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,something racist about black people stereotypes exist for a reason something pointing out men as perpetrators or women as victims hey now not all men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i commented with facts and stats that prove that women face more domestic and sexual violence than men and got downvoted to hell of course because im a womencentric sexist asshole apparently gotta love reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can someone think about the men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when will people understand that being specific doesnt equal being exclusionary people really seem to percieve x often happens to y group as x never happens to anyone else when thats not implied anywhere by the first statement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why not just end all violence completely there are other types other than domestic s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont somebody think of the men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit on every single fucking issue that affects minorities or women but what about the white males
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but domestic abuse isnt solely linked to womengirls why even have that there just have the title as end domestic violence suggesting men need any help at all will get you called a woman hating sexist by most college age women in reply to on but domestic abuse isnt solely linked to womengirls why even have that there just have the title as end domestic violence at utc jaagerstanger wrote suggesting men need any help at all will get you called a woman hating sexist by most college age women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and redditors who think the rape of men dont real or say that theyre jealous whenever a man or boy is sexually assaulted by a woman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is also a stigma against men who appear weak men are supposed to be strong not show emotional weakness vulnerability is to be avoided little does most of reddit know feminazis also want to help men got down voted for saying essentially this in that thread and got yelled at about how the patriarchy isnt real and all that typical bs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres some biased statistics to support my racism and misogyny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,love the strawman right there buddy how long did it take you to make it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not like they actually care about domestic violence whether the victim is male or female they just want to shit on women while i do personally believe that domestic and sexual violence against men is significantly underreported due to toxic masculinity i also have no doubts far more women are victimised
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,last time i said that men commit more of x crime on reddit i got death threatsit was just sad i dont point out the obvious anymore on certain subreddits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even if men were abused more than women that still wouldnt be a point against the poster in question because violence against women would still be happening making a poster addressing violence against women does not equal advocating or ignoring violence against men contrary to what these mra types think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were raising funds for cancer research but whatabaut raising funds for meeeeee reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that reminds me international mens day just passed on the of this month not many men celebrated it and i dont recall women belittling or scoffing at the holiday much like what happened to a very similar holiday earlier this year but its clearly the womens fault s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think ever for some of these people they see blm as only black lives matter they either cant or refuse to look past their privilege and acknowledge some groups have greater disparity than others
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youve also got to look at reporting toxic masculinity discourages reporting it it shows that you have fallen beneath a woman essentially also emotional abuse is hard to report and prove which is more common based on my limited experience
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres also a dash of wanting to be contrarian because they have nothing actually intelligent or interesting to say but still want to portray the image of being smart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,while i do personally believe that domestic and sexual violence against men is significantly underreported due to toxic masculinity thats the thing they disregard the last part to shit on women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i honestly didnt know anyone thought the things people have been commentingthat men are victims of domestic violence at higher rates than women that the widely accepted stat that in women are sexually assaulted in their lifetime is completely false that violence against men is a more pressing issue etc its extremely disturbing and bizarre
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the entire month is when men grow silly moustaches to raise money for prostate cancer in the uk probably due to mens day being in the middle of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit made a fuss about google not having a doodle for mens dayit was pretty hilarious for them to complain about something so petty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree entirely which was why i said i do personally believe that domestic and sexual violence against men is significantly underreported due to toxic masculinity i just dont get why so many men refuse to consider toxic masculinity and the patriarchy its amazing how many genuine mens issues are linked to them i sometimes wonder if its the names i know i used to roll my eyes at the mention of the patriarchy until one day i finally listened and discovered the source of several personal problems of my own theyre not gone but at least i understand where they came from and thats a start
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,possibly against the rules as im already so active in the thread if so ill remove the submission honestly just needed a space to vent at how ridiculous the comments are i spend a lot time on football subreddits and usually arent too bad on gender politics at least comparatively but nothing shits me more than straight white men of which i am one crapping on about how sensitive this generation is compared to the past
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in response to someone being fired for harassment actually a joke at how people in this world are becoming so sensitive to everything at utc replied to actually a joke at how people in this world are becoming so sensitive to everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in exactly the same way advancements in technology have created more sensitive instruments of measurement and observation so too have advancements in social understanding become more sensitive to certain happenings the issue is that a charge of sensitivity is used to indicate an affected and so illegitimate sense of outrage a fastidious ethic for shutting people down what do they propose is the reason for wanting to shut people down misandry the promotion of the feminist agenda biologicallyentrenched female vitriol nor hell a fury like a woman scorned that does not offer much more in a line of causality than it happened because it happened why in the first place this mistrust of men or promotion of feminism or display of outrage well because these sorts of things must have been going on a long time and there comes a point after which saying please call me by my name and please dont touch me to no productive end becomes tiresome now i have sympathy for the host that got fired in this way his instrument for measuring appropriate behaviour was calibrated a long time ago and has been tunedup in a system that situates women as targets onto which we can displace our sentiments affections and propositions at will and without consequence i have no doubt he is flabbergasted and likely views his actions innocently unfortunately we can view certain behaviours innocently all day long but only actions send the message that this is not so and on the other hand hes had a long and successful career its okay and is perhaps time for him to move on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,get your comments removed in rnews for discussing that the attacker was somaliborn at utc dotcomonmybongos replied to get your comments removed in rnews for discussing that the attacker was somaliborn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like how they found a way to shoehorn their white tears into this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats like banning users for frequenting other subs those mods are same as chinese govt mindblown you might want to take a break from reddit dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,speech realism freeze peaches
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no reddit a sub is not a country
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh what a bunch of fucking crybabies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gotta make it about cis straight white men somehow ¯ツ¯
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae communities that attract trolls and harassment shouldnt be allowed to take measures to mitigate that harassment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,by that logic donald trump is like the mods of rchina
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on brad pitt being banned from china after meeting the dali lamathats like banning users for frequenting other subs those mods are same as chinese govt mindblownso you mean china is roffmychest in reply to bobabelly on until just a couple years ago brad pitt was banned from visiting china for being in a movie that portrayed the dalai lama positively seven years in tibet the drama revolves around the tibetan independence from china china can hold a grudge at utc fatclownbaby wrote thats like banning users for frequenting other subs those mods are same as chinese govt mindblown
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,idk why theyre all so mad they cant post there their posting would just get them banned anyway i was looking thru some trump trolls post history recently and saw him post one time in offmychest the thread title i hate fat people truly something he just had to get off his chest he was banned for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah screw those subs made for people to have free expression without harassment blocking users of subreddits that encourage harassment le edit whoops speaking of subs that encourage harassment its time for our daily brigadesturbation where we put on some anita sarkeesian videos and brigade ourselves gently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,posts on subs notorious for being insensitive to womens lgbt and ethnic minority issues complains about being banned from subs created to help people in greatest need of sensitivity compares this to being on the shitlist of a dictatorship justredditthings
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,getting banned from a private web forum is literally the same as a totalitarian regime you guys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors hate nothing more than talking about anything or anyone other than themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine having such an empty life that being banned from a web forum caries the same weight as being banned from a country thats beyond not leaving your basement levels of having a small world id bet he never leaves one corner of his basement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and being banned from a forum isnt a violation of your human rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,neither is horseradish
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpswwwchangeorgpuniversitiessuspendsocialjusticeinuniversities
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah ignore the useful information reddit and focus on the body shaming and tired jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lbs thats holocaust weight in reply to on staples mesh office chair daily psa i have owned this chair before and it lasted me about months keep in mind that im not a big guy ft and the stitching in the back came out of the plastic leaving me leaning on the lumbarsupport bar constantly furthermore the plasticy arm cushions cracked and started splitting from resting my elbows on them although it never got really bad i also had the compressed air thing the chair actually sits on top of the thing that makes it go up and down starting to give out on me despite never overloading the chair or moving it up and down myself i always kept it at the max height for my desk at utc slicecheese wrote lbs thats holocaust weight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am glad to see other australians pointing out that our local slang doesnt work close to how reddit thinks it does only trashy people drop cslurs like they are nothing it may be softer a slur culturally than in the us but it is still a pretty hard one to use and is in most instances super gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well sure but so is nigger but i probably wouldnt drop it in a debate but you just did
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just a way to shut down an argument regardless of the other sides merits what merits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah reddit defending a conservative politician with a history of sexism and bigotry yet again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and we can tell so much from whats going on by the context of the video too right we can see how they both conducted themselves leading up to this moment oh we cant i guess ill just assume then and looked pretty smug about it i personally would have said the guy sitting back with his arms crossed and eyes alight while he repeated the word hypocrite and spoke over her answering his apparently hypothetical questions was the smug one but im a lady so im not good at things like not automatically blaming the woman in the video
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre a man so what youre saying is irrelevant and shitty doesnt get much more sexist than that does it yeah cuz rape and death by forced pregnancy are totally less sexist than upsetting my feelz
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean sure mainsplaining is probably an infuriating term when you deliberately misunderstand what it means i also fly into a rage when people tell me hello but i interpret it to mean eat shit so i totally get where theyre coming from
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how sheltered do you have to be to think that mansplaining is in any way the same as nigger like really how ignorant are these children do they have any idea what its like to have someone reduce you to a stereotype and refuse to see you as a human being with a word like paki or nigger of course they dont the dumb ignorant fucks brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my wife wow being straight is all you can talk about huh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,weird i hadhave a lot of friends thay are lgbt and i talked to them like a normal human and we had fulfilling conversations about many things sometimes about sexuality but also about other things who would have guessed that lgbt people are actuslly humans after all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im gay and hate when other gays only talk about how gay they are a handful of gay jokes and some gay topics are fine but jesus christ shut the hell up this shit infuriates me i see it all the time and it just allows redditors to think i cant be bigoted a gay agreed with me thanks gay uncle tom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh i hate hanging out with straight people all they talk about is straight stuff wheres my upvotes and reddit gold
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how much you want to bet that being gay was all the seemed to talk about actually means they like everyone else in the world would talk about their experiences and things that were important to them occasionally this meant they would talk about experiences related to being gaybitrans i am so emotionally stunted that i am incapable of relating to people who are not exactly like me so i found it impossible to be interested in them and their lives because i cannot imagine anything beyond my own subjectivity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,straight people are literally so self unaware its astonishing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and guess what theres literally nothing wrong with that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anyone find it strange that the only lgbt people he could find something interesting to talk about shared his interests maybe just maybe it was himself that was unable to expand his horizons and talk about something outside his comfort zone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao where the hell is nonheterosexuality boring sorry you cant deal het boy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny considering of the topics my friends talk about is sex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god forbid people talk about what theyre passionate about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao i replied to that guy in that thread and got downvoted to hell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,apologies for the offensiveness but this comment reminded me of it and kinda raises a funny counterpoint
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hanging out with my wifes lgbt friends during college was always a drag not because they were gay but because being gay was all they seemed able to talk about it was just always incredibly boring at utc fulltorsoapparition replied to hanging out with my wifes lgbt friends during college was always a drag not because they were gay but because being gay was all they seemed able to talk about it was just always incredibly boring except for the two nerdy dudes who hosted their own minecraft server and liked to talk about computers and electronics with me you guys made those gatherings at least bearable and i hope youre both still banging each other right now httpiimgurcombltgvudpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait what i thought lgbt people were just a bunch of robots who sat around repeating shit like theyre practicing for a daft punk cover band
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously where are all these people supposedly finding hoards of lgbt people who only talk about sexuality ive never encountered this my closest group of friends consists of girls who are all lesbian and guess what we talk about the office music ramen memes ya know normal human conversation because were all normal humans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gay people hey so this is how it is straight people one gay person um actually all those annoying gays are wrong im not your average homosexual im a homiesexual straight people this guy gets it finally the gays are making sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this but unironically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whenever people say all those lgbt people talk about is being lgbt ugh like what does that actually mean sitting in a circle and repeating are you gay haha yeah me too buddy which ngl sounds like a great time or is it more discussing how discrimination manifests in different areas of life talking about their own personal experiences with queerphobia mentioning certain aspects of queer culture talking about the existence of queer culture and why exactly it arose because being queer has such a big impact on how you conceptualize your own sense of self and how you relate to the world at large around you its literally such a broad topic but cishet people will dismiss this all immediately and reduce it down to those darn gays going off about being gay again its so frustrating to see the lack of awareness and the unwillingness to understand when you do present straight people with all this whats funny is straight people literally do the same thing you cant even scroll down to the comment section of one picture of a woman without reading comments from straight dudes about her boobs you have a bunch of men constantly lamenting about how theyre unattractive to women some comedians base their whole comedy persona off of the im shitty at getting girls thing you have the existence of the ball and chain wife and whipped husband comedy trope since straightness is the presumed identity these straight people dont feel the need to clarify theyre straight but all this stuff operates on that fact straight humor is so ingrained into the default that it doesnt register as straight humor and just general human humor anyway im too gay and tired of this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they like everyone else in the world would talk about their experiences and things that were important to them occasionally this meant they would talk about love sport work etc i am so emotionally stunted that i am incapable of relating to people who are not exactly like me so i found it impossible to be interested in them and their lives because i cannot imagine anything beyond my own subjectivity this does seem like the baseline for most people tbh in fact they often bond with others over how different a third party are from themselves empathy is a skill and it is often sorely untrained
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it has to be a huge joke conspiracy straight guys literally cant stop talking about women vaginas boobs and dicks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fucking dullass breeders
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously i recently discovered rupauls drag race and its the greatest contribution to pop culture ive ever seen name one straight thing that is as good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,too blurry to read
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not going to lie that would have been alot more fun who doesnt like a good daft punk tribute band
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no idea i talk about sex with lgbt people the same as i do with non lgbt people it seems to stem from the same thought that non straight people are hyper sexual like when guys worry that a gay guy will want to fuck them just becuase theyre gay as if they find every man attractive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,precisely same goes for every other minority group on reddit too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and then that one gay guy gets caught on video advocating for pedophilia and they trip over themselves coming to his defense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whenever people say all those lgbt people talk about is being lgbt ugh like what does that actually mean sitting in a circle and repeating are you gay haha yeah me too buddy which ngl sounds like a great time brb setting up a new meetup xd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,empathy is definitely a skill i am in full agreement there the interesting thing is the internet makes it easier than ever both to train that skill by connecting with and listening to the stories of people unlike yourself and to let that skill atrophy by seeking out and sticking to microcommunities of people who share your every belief down to the detail in a way i wrongly or rightly is up for debate expect everyone to seize the empathysharpening opportunities presented by the web when they dont i get incredibly frustrated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,empathy is a skill thats unproductive unamerican and kinda gays
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think people are born with empathy but a lot of people let theirs rot when theyre teenagers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,meanwhile my brothers think its creepy whenever i say that that some guy is hot we were watching brooklyn ninenine and i just absentmindedly mentioned that i think terry crews is attractive and they looked at me like i had described how i want him to fuck me in excruciatingly pornographic detail lgb people are still not allowed to be attracted to people or express attraction in public
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my ex god bless him hes an awesome guy was just lamenting this fact he actually called me because he needed to rant about how gross it is that guys just sit around talking sexually about girls he said he cant bring up a girl without someone saying did you bang her and he actually got up and left when they started comparing vaginas of girls they all knew barf he says when its just straight dudes in a room it really is like that a lot of the time i just dont get how anyone thinks thats an acceptable topic of conversation when we were dating too he said hed say something like man im really excited my gf is coming today and every guy responds with some version of yeah dude sex and hes like uh no i actually enjoy my girlfriend as a human and shes way smarter and more fun to talk to than you pieces of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,panel wheres odin gone for a s panel uhh you know i like odin an everything but you ever notice all he ever talks about is hatin n slurs panel aint that the point yeah but all the time i dont know if hes doin it to impress us but its hate n slurs this hate n slurs that all im sayin is that at least the restve us talk about other things you know panel yeah sure just the other day me and lance had a real good conversation about tractor pulls odin arrives hey fellas panel boy i sure do hate n slurs enough thiss horse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no you see its actually a terrible burden you have to actually come up with conspiracy theories and work hard to pretend to be oppressed it doesnt just find you you have to struggle to find a struggle and thats why the straight cis white male is the the most victimized class
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a black man from the i think that this mlk guy has some good ideas maybe but his methods are far too extreme
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh trust me if you got those straight guys together around other straight dudes they trust and they would go into graphic detail and how they would have sex with a hot women and not even bat an eye so many of my college male friends would do that shit all the time one inparticular always use to talk about having butt sex his words were more graphic whenever he got a chance to talk about women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a straight guy but i gotta second you choice on terry crews hes all handsome and built and funny plus hes a nice guy on a personalphilosophical level which is a huge bonus good choice ufullclockworkoddessy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that and hes got poweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sigh back to the usual generalizing about white people is racist two comments later well black people are scaaaary and violent because crime statistics im tempted to point out that its not about race but systemic oppression and income levels but id just get downvoted and i dont want to deal with the abuse id get in the replies god this site is fucking garbage sometimes reverse racism is the real issue saying white people are racist is racister reddit isnt sexist the real sexism is sexism against men what are you talking about reddit never upvotes sexism sigh its not like there are at least half a dozen subs devoted to specifically put down women that make it to all constantly and i guess no one has ever read the comments on any subreddit when feminism is brought up i get it people want to stick their head in the sand but its so damn infuriating instead of accepting it they downvote and throw insults your way i should just delete my political account its not even worth engaging these people anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at the mall earlier i was waiting in line at the food court and this woman in front of me was talking on her phone and she sounded like such an awful person when i got in line all i heard was theyre everywhere its not as bad as in markham but theyre still everywhere theyre taking over then she started whining about millennials and how theyre weak and wont fight the muslims she ended her call and placed her order and i just stood there in shock ive never seen anyone be so publicly awful in person before i wish i would have said something but im sure that wouldnt have ended well surreal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,went to sleep early for once and managed to wake up at am feeling refreshed i like waking up early i decided to catch up with steven universe but now i wish i didnt have to go to school or work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i contracted a minor case of last night it reminded me a lot of when i had strep throat in january for the first time in years a brief period of nostalgia i used to get strep every year followed quickly by a desire for it to just go away i had actually forgotten just how shitty both things were
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,had one today arguing about how america isnt racist towards blacks and how hes totally beyond seeing skin color because hes in an interracial relationship me the other regressive leftists are all racists for even talking about the issue hes a white guy with an asian gf thousands of karma in td has said in the last week that islam isnt a race its a regressive ideology that needs to be fought also immigrants need to assimilate asians were the good ones i guess assimilation means sucking my dick
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,then she started whining about millennials and how theyre weak and wont fight the muslims because she would have done such an excellent job herself if the woman has the idiocy to go through with it well be laughing at her as she gets carted to prison for mass slaughter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,going to bed early and waking up early is the best mornings are so quiet and relaxing at my old place i had a sun room so every morning i would eat breakfast there while the sun rises i miss it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,until recently i had trouble sleeping early rather than you know go to bed early i simply started going to sleep so late my biological bedtime moved later to not earlier but hey it worked now i can stay awake through classes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,damn i wish i could get refreshing sleep for once
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love writing in the mornings before work that mix of still being hazy after sleep being fresh and lucid and having had my dreams to get me in the writing mood is super conducive to both having fun with it and giving it my best
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry if i sound ignorant but whats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds heavenly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont be so hard on yourselfit took me two and a half weeks to get a good sleep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the shittiest mra ive ever dealt with he was banned from femradebates even for being too obnoxious ignorance of this is a huge blessing trust me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,srss biggest fan
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont be so hard on yourselfit took me two and a half weeks to get a good sleep about two and half weeks is probably just enough sleep for me to feel refreshed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,must be nice not to have to fear cops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so many comments saying i am white and have been arrested therefore no underlying racial issues exist within law enforcement mmmmmmk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel almost bad posting this here because the poster is clearly not saying anything out of malice or hate but it still exudes a general white privileged ignorance that plagues reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people fearing cops is on the cops not on those people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its awesome when you dont have to have the fear of being murdered by a cop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its awesome that they are teaching their kids not to fear cops at utc pmmefunthingsplz replied to its awesome that they are teaching their kids not to fear cops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah like they are clearly trying to say something nice but when you take a step back why do some people fear cops its not for no reason
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah most redditors have adopted a pavlovian hostile response to anything being linked here and most people dont even bother to read the comments but if they do they usually read our comments in completely the wrong tone that selfjustifies whatever preconceptions they already had before even clicking the link i just dont understand how to realistically reach out to these people without going into a long and oftenfutile oneonone discussion that takes an inordinate amount of time and effort to construct and waterproof
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,probably because breitbart has strong ties to racism and white nationalism as well as the alt right but milo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its almost like a reactionary rag that says such stellar things as birth control makes women unattractive and crazy compares planned parenthood to the holocaust and is led by a white supremacist antisemite is deplorable and awful
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone with an opinion must be taken equally seriously thats why i know theres a chance that my cat is a satanic witch
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everything that is ever said by anyone anywhere has equal validity and should be treated as equally credible and valuable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course theres a guy saying that breitbart isnt a total nazi rag because a gay man works for them donald trump has an immigrant wife but it doesnt stop him saying awful shit about immigrants
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously though buzzfeed news is a pretty solid source and has some pretty damn good journalists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when they allow posts from buzzfeed and hillarys site but dont allow articles from breutbart you can tell there is a bias in reply to mcbliz on its hilarious rpolitics has turn into a ball of impotent rage at utc loserskid wrote when they allow posts from buzzfeed and hillarys site but dont allow articles from breutbart you can tell there is a bias httpiimgurcomtwwfsllpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well being gay means youre entitled to being antigay and if you have a black boyfriend you cant be racists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what does the but milo even mean that if youre gay you cant be a racist white nationalist legitimately asking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bias doesnt even mean shit so what people have opinions big fucking whoop show me one news site that has no bias oh wait there are none because humans have things called feelings and opinions its just a stupid argument to discredit news people disagree with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,britebort
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i imagine someone saying this with a very thick french accent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dimfart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or the daily stormer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the original comment was iirc their tech editor is a gay jew with a black boyfriend in reference to milo yiannopoulos basically exactly what you said the comment implies that since he is gay and has a black boyfriend he has a free pass to be racist misogynist homophobic etc milos bigotry is then used to excuse the same behavior from breitbart and its readers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,burntbort
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,buzzfeeds clickbait articles are clickbaity and terrible but occasionally buzzfeed news will have some fairly good investigative journalism its a bit weird when you see bbc citing buzzfeed as a source but its the journalism bit which is seperate from the clickbait apparently theyre using the ad revenue from the clickbait to fund the journalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,buzzfeed news hired some serious legitimate journalists and is pretty good check them out its pretty separate from buzzfeed pop culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,david clarke isif hes not a fascist i dont know what the fuck hes trying to be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay thank you i knew he was gay but i didnt know he was dating someone black which as we all know is a get out of racism free card whoever is dating him really needs to love himself tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,börkbörk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reichbart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now that is a publication i can get behind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have mixed feelings about this its more complicated than that in nature the idea that animals dont consent is semantic but much animal sex is willing after courtship and pair bonding but i do think it would be fair to say that rape and murder are both concepts built upon social understanding and ethics that we cant necessarily apply to animals like there isnt an absolute rape the lines between what is and isnt rape is culturally defined and fluid unfortunately what one person calls rape is another persons sexual assault is another persons something else etc or murder when is taking a life justified is taking a life justified when do you draw the line that a life couldnt have been saved how do you apply blame its all socially constructed so in a sense i think theyre literally right but came to that conclusion by the wrong means
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rape isnt a thing in the animal world neither is murder in reply to endlessagony on forced copulations great euphemism at utc meanmrmustardman wrote its not a euphemism rape isnt a thing in the animal world neither is murder edit so the people who have never studied the environment that are down voting me go learn what the definitions of rape and murder are youll discover that both are acts exclusively committed against humans an animal cant rape or murder another animal an animal can forcibly copulate or kill another animal its not a euphemism its the proper term i dont expect the average reader of this subreddit to have any actual academic experience with nature so i dont know why im surprised
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reactionaries really arent very clever that shits all super mild compared to some of the things people say openly here on reddit i mean hell that one person has probably never actually even shot a cis male in the dick and should therefore be ejected from feminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you sure ranarchocapitalism isnt lowhanging fruit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on the rfullcommunism discord leaks disgusting that being said im feeling good about hatefucking the one thats transitioning provided they havent gone under the knife yet typically with these sjws the things they rail against in public are things they secretly love in the bedroom at utc replied to disgusting that being said im feeling good about hatefucking the one thats transitioning provided they havent gone under the knife yet typically with these sjws the things they rail against in public are things they secretly love in the bedroom oppression sexual ownership verbal abuse etc are their bread and butter i had to survive four years where my choices for sex were sjws or theater fags and as horrible as sjws are jesus christ theyre not nearly as bad as theater people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im only an occasional wanderer here to srsis your last line part of the humor i feel stupid asking but as you reference reddit is full of things like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you like i said i feel stupid for even asking but reddit does have some prett horible things said sincerely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a huge number of people on srs are cis males like me no one really says these things seriously it is just a joke against a group of people that have a long history of victimizing women and trans people its called punching up it doesnt really have any political clout behind it so its never really serious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and i have no problem being on the receiving end of a jokeits just important to read the room and know that is the type of humour i dont mind it at all as long as i know it is humour
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i understand i just wanted to explain it thoroughly because its very common on reddit for people to start yelling reverse ism when you make fun of a privileged group to insinuate that those statements are always equally wrong regardless of sociohistorical context
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there oppressed muslim mlady youre free to wear what you want yeah cool can you give me back my hijab no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women exercising freedom its feminism gone wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whatever happened to i personally find this offensive but they have a right to free expression 🤔
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i a man should decide whats proper for a woman to wear in fact we should make it a law a moral law
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im totally for actual feminism although i have no fucking idea what it is and also heres an ignorant statement to wrap it up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why does this stuff fly over these peoples heads so easy forcing women to take off certain garments is no different than forcing her to put them on its still telling her how she should look whether she wants to wear hot pants or a niqab and abaya is none of your business
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,privileged anxious dudes finds it unacceptable absolutely unacceptable that this is none of their business and this state of affair must be remediated immediately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,klan rally they have a right to wear what they want and free speech shall never be infringed some woman wearing hijab hijab must be banned they have no right to wear it or express themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feminism is good actually but only the white kind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im totally for actual feminism just not the kind that means i have to do anything about the issues in the west
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why is reddit so obsessed with that video egypt does not even force the hijab nowadays and egyptian government workers are banned from wearing it on the job or do they not realize that muslim communities vary drastically in their culture and norms from one another
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course a man gets to choose what actual feminism is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not a big fan of the hijab but even so i can recognise that i would be a very bad feminist if i tried to control what women wore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how about women can be left alone to find empowerment and freedom of expression in whatever the fuck they want
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some actually advocate for wearing hijabs in the history of homo so it doesnt truly impede on your free speech so its odd to say otherwise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im totally for actual feminism but many feminists are misguided some actually advocate for wearing hijabs in the us at utc replied to im totally for actual feminism but many feminists are misguided some actually advocate for wearing hijabs in the us httpiimgurcomzquzurgpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im totally for white feminism ftfy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone in the replies actually compared the hijab to a fucking swastika
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,op is thinking of libertarians
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,freedom to wear what the fuck you want to wear i assume this is an idiot who thinks hijab niqabburqa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brown people and women dont have that right according to these sort of people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly youre not making their life any easier by forcing them to not wear it at worst they just wont show up in public anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because muh volksgemeinschaft thats why im not saying that all of these chaps are fullblown cardcarrying nazis but it looks that deep inside they believe that an individual must conform to a groups requirements and that group is the dominant ethnosocial one in this case europeandescented aka white middleclass cultural christians
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a woman may tell you she like her hijab but theres a whole other deal of women who are forced to wear it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean many muslim women see it as a source of empowerment i think redditurds are just mad they cant easily jerk off to covered women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being forced to remove a piece of clothing is the opposite of personal freedom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a piece of clothing that some women choose to wear others may be forced into wearing it by outlawing this piece of clothing youre taking the freedom to wear it away from all women because you want to save a few women from being forced how can you not see the hypocrisy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no more than the wimple was but it was never banned and some nuns choose to wear it today bonus round since youre an expert on representations of a womans personal freedom how many of httpimgurcomarozxi represent the opposite of personal freedom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brown people and women dont have any rights according to these people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,her bathing suit hijab combo sorry i dont know the proper terminology its called a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiburkini
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yet those who advocate the forced removal of burkinis for being too religious rarely advocate the assault of nuns for being overtly religious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but trust me i think its so funny when people say this on reddit lmao like why would i trust you who even are you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yet both are still wrong so whats your point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,which is a sadly misleading name given that theyre far more like a hijab than anything else
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you for helping us understand that youre the victim in this situation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the modern us citizen is more accepting than most nations in the history of mankind yeah so accepting that a presidential candidate who has made a pillar of his campaign out of brazen xenophobia has come close second in the popular vote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hijabikini is too good a word for them to have not considered it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sobrave
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muslim banning calling mexican people rapists cops murdering innocent black kids a good chunk of americans dont even consider trans people humans so warm and accepting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is lying intentionally know how you can tell he keeps saying believe me jon stewart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well what i mean is that people hear burkini and imagine something like the burka
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe you just need to stop saying racist shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its cool weve demonized the word racist but not racism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone is an sjw now it literally means nothing besides youre saying something i dont like self awareness is wonderful isnt it stormfront reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i say shit people dont like all the time never been called racistweird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but muh freeze peach honestly though every time ive seen people being called out for being racist they were being racist racial microaggressions and spewing racial stereotypes counts as racism a lot of people on reddit seem to think you have to dress in a kkk costume and scream racial slurs to be racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course its just a complete coincidence that the whole everyone gets called racist now is a stormfront meme theyre trying to use to normalize the fact that they get called racists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so im supposed to like being called an ape til
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ever thought that people dont like you because of the verbal diarrhea that you spew
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how many times has that poster called someone an sjw in response to an opinion they dont like hmm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how these are the same groups of people to call blm a anti white hate group
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe youre just too dumb to realise you are a racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is it with racists and trying to downplay the term racist its like they know its bad and that they dont like being called a racist but they dont want to stop spewing racist bile in order to not be called racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nobody is a racist according to racists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,le redditeur i dont like when you say that you dont like something i said
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well at least the top comment on there was alright
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny i say things people dont like many of those people are what redditors would call sjws somehow though not once do i get called racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae feminists offended by everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,worthless whining whites wont win
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the hell happened here i clicked on the link and every single comment had been removed every comment on this post is criticizing this guy for being racist after all so im inclined to believe them but all of the comments are also downvoted to shit my hypothesis op deleted all the comments from the original link when he found out people didnt agree then made different accounts and downvoted every comment on this thread so they lost credibility
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel the same way about sjw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone is a racist now it literally means nothing besides youre saying something i dont like in reply to on and so what if it was a race id rather be safe than be worried about being called a racist at utc isforusernames wrote but its not never will be and everyone is a racist now it literally means nothing besides youre saying something i dont like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no way its the other peoples fault
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no youre racist for saying im racist because i say racist shit see my logic is rock solid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i blame white moderates
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same problem as with rape p
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was reading on sws that someone was called a jewish race traitor i mean racists are weird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rule
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its because we have this extreme mentality that racist absolute terrible horrible person and racism one of the worst things you could possibly do so someone says something racist without meaning to and someone else says thats racist to person a what theyve just been told is what you just said was an awful thing and you are also an awful person because of it so person a gets all defensive because no they arent an awful person they promise i am in no way saying we should not demonize people who are actively and ardently racist but this is the reason some people get so upinarms about political correctness and microaggressions they think its used to paint them as terrible people when really its just minorities trying to change behaviors so that people stop accidentally saying and doing racist things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah you know its bad when people are blatantly racist and dont even recognize it anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be honest riding around in a kkk costume and screaming racial slurs isnt even remotely racist by reddit standards
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,didnt u know the only two ways to be racist are to be in the process of lynching someone with a completely unprompted signed affidavit that it was racially motivated and a complete record of your personal history analyzed by no less than of your racial peers to prove that you werent misinterpreting your own actions or to be brown and have even the slightest effect on anyones life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these people usually white also say theyre not one which shows a lack of understanding of biology and the taxonomy system but theres a big difference in saying we have a common ancestor with modern african apes and calling a human a monkey but i bet they try that move the goalposts shit all the time fuck them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nobodys racist anymore the entire idea of race died out as soon as the civil rights act was passed and racisms entire historical impact was erased by mlk himself plus the racists back then literally carried cards that identified them as racists and said the nword every other sentence if you dont do that youre just really skeptical not a racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites are the biggest crybullies its like the word was designed with us in mind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck me im an idiot are the votes on this thread reversed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the brown peoples fault ftfy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only if the perpetrator is white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,better now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so blackandwhite thinking youre either a racist and deserve to die or not racist and you can do no wrong fwiw i sympathize i guess but i do not feel any need to bend reality to suit someone elses cognitive errors that shit is between them and glob
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just a different opinion than ours
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but where i live you would be kicked out the supermarket even walmart great living in britain and thats after everyone has stopped stared got their phones out and recorded your weird racist rant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yup just go by color orange yay blue nay and remember that every comment has an extra minus sign in front of its karma score in fact if you have a comment that gets into negative karma it will have two minus signs like this its done just as you say to make it harder for disgruntled redditeurs to come in and downvote everyone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think soi just got here and im super confused
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the black peoples fault brown arent black enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree but i think its good to know how other people might be thinking especially when its about something like this that way you can change more minds hopefully
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol thank you for the explanation just started poking around on this sub after being a dumbass and there are a lot of disgruntled redditeurs commenting on the original posts after the bot links to here theyre a lot of fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i just pieced it together i havent used this sub much basically op was criticizing the linked comment which you can find using the bot at the bottom of this thread but i didnt realize that at first i thought he was genuinely saying everyone was racist as for the downvote thing its just a weird default setting in this sub kind of confusing if you ask me but its not too bad i still feel like an idiot tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no hating muh slims is in now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the blacks fault blacks arent people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they are arent they d
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i forget about it sometimes since i browse with subreddit custom themes turned off srs and every other subreddit has the bland default ui which has its benefits i can still downvote just fine in any subreddit that removes the downvote button but also its drawbacks srs threads often have lovely graphics and pictures that i miss out on particularly on the occasion that someone is banned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the downvote means that you agree that its poop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy thundertits youre right i completely forgot somehow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am not a doctor so i dont know the answer this really says it all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know shit about how sex hormones work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,too bad for the transphobe that the ioc and pretty much every other athletic organization with a policy disagrees with him because medical science and ethics disagree with him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you are correct trans women shouldnt be allowed to compete this is because transitioning is a choice and there is a lot of famemoney to be made it isnt fair to someone who worked hard to be the best with what they were born with oh my fucking god i wish it was a choice if so i would choose yes but i cant some salt for me to start my day and yet again we brigaded ourselves feeemales not only suck at sports but suck at aiming their brigades reeeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but lets not give a damn over people who juice with testosterone to get an edge
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,valuable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is my favorite post in that comment thread i think one of the issues with hrt is that some folks dont feel it negates the advantage created in body and bone structure during puberty feels reals when it comes to trans people ofc also the unspoken assumption that trans people always undergo the puberty of their cab sex politifact rates as pants on fire i tend to think it does against the rulings of countless sports governing bodies and medical authorities with no evidence or justification and that unfortunately precludes transwomen from seriously competing in sports if they undergo hrt uh howzat i havent heard from a good solution to this problem so far besides the existing policies of trans inclusion supported by decades of medical study you know renee richards was over years ago dumbfuck and i do feel somewhat guilty on a personal level further excluding one of the most marginalized groups in history yeah im sure you do fuck cis shit however i dont think the issue is entirely decided and i could be easily persuaded with evidence to the contrary theres this thing called google five minutes is all it would take ah yes but you dont care enough to look things up you prefer ignorance sucks to be you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man fuck this white noise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tldr opinions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you are correct trans women shouldnt be allowed to compete this is because transitioning is a choice and there is a lot of famemoney to be made it isnt fair to someone who worked hard to be the best with what they were born with i dont even know what hes getting at here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and unfortunately people lie about this sort of thing i wonder why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,s o b r a v e
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think transwomen should be allowed to compete at utc replied to the article has an obvious slant but i get where it is coming from in the past the ioc and others have treated this process pretty crudely and needlessly embarassing some athletes however you do need some type of standard and process i dont think transwomen should be allowed to compete and unfortunately people lie about this sort of thing so you need some type of testing but it should be handled better for sure i am not a doctor so i dont know the answer but i am sure a group of doctors could decide on something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not like the ioc and doctors arent more qualified than the average redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think hes saying trans women are too famousrich to compete in the olympics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh look so many minuses i think theres an option to only let the subreddit subscribers vote but thats not much now if we could devise some limitation where voting or commenting would be only possible after solving a test with questions like what is the feminist stance on who should pay for dates is it racist to believe that black people can be sexist and what is a clitoris that would be enough to successfully separate ourselves from like of those against us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,looks like srs is brigading itself again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah take that filthy bot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when it comes to trans stuff they might not be but well probably better than a redditor but
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because that makes so much sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,poor srsbot the thing didnt deserve this nonsense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that was extensive i think i need a nap now in reply to santorumsandwich on nsfw at utc organiccrystalmeth wrote that was extensive i think i need a nap now httpiimgurcomqnolirlpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats the difference between reverse racism and racism not trolling just genuinely curious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the word you are looking for is either prejudice or bigotryracism is much more than spitting racial epithets on the street
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get a bit angry hearing the term reverse racism its just delusion folks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how dare they say reverse racism we white people need a safe space to protect ourselves reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get a bit angry hearing the term reverse racism its just racism folks at utc haust replied to topically the discussion in the program was farranging studentdriven and explored reverse racism i get a bit angry hearing the term reverse racism its just racism folks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reverse racism is when people are racist towards white people like affirmative action is reverse racism or not calling black people the nword is reverse racism its some bullshit reactionary buzzword
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please be mindful of rule x
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah those words are better without a doubt however its descriptively incorrect to say that either colloquial or academic use of a word is wrong obviously though equating bigotry that white folks might face with day to day institutionalized racism poc face is fucking bonkers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rtheadolf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to expand its used by people who dont understand power structures
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is a circle queef
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it means that we are here to vent together and we dont want to be interrupted by actually that comment isnt racist or whatever we are very strict on this rule to keep trolls at bay

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes all fun at parties hinges on telling and laughing at boring and tired racist jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so youre technically not a racist thats your defense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,such wit i feel like we should be swirling brandy snifters and wearing monocles while doing this bit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really have to wonder what racists hope to achieve with this kind of nonsensical line of defense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,much sarcasm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cucking the sheeple duhh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,context httpsenwikipediaorgwikitedkaczynskipoliticalandsocialviews
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if our society had no social problems at all the leftists would have to invent problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss if our society had different thing then things would be different
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah theres no way anyones gonna read all that shit lmao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,woah bonus points for using leftist in a sentence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no title no conclusion just a pile of poorly formatted dot points which are numbered d work on your communication skills
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,engage me let me come into your sub and expect you to waste your time and energy on me you surely have nothing better to do but argue in circles with someone who thinks you are subhuman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this the altright equivalent to the un charter of human rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its truly staggering how indistinguishable this excerpt from the ravings of an insane serial murderer is from typical reddit discourse edit op has admitted in the rbadsocialscience thread that this is a quote from the unabomber manifesto i read through it and had no idea it was anything other than this guys thoughts on sjws the altright is terrifying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmfao what is this altright crap
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im gay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres a hint simply saying we conclude does not mean that you dont have to present the logical steps to reach that conclusion if you are presenting a thesis go back to logic heres a second hint when making commentary on demographic behaviour studies with clear explanations of sampling methodology should be referenced rather than their findings asserted this might pass high school science standards for papers but would not suffice for higher education purposes let alone a peer reviewed journal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is it i found it the hottest take of all time™
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men actually were stronger and more capable than men we dont even need to prove it just open your eyes this post sums up how fragile masculinity is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings possibly more or less repressed and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism yeah ill just stop reading right here bye
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i assume a pro psychogist like you has heard of projection right

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all i wanted to do was enjoy a cute puppy being petscratched without having someone shit on koreans just because youre signed into reddit does not mean you have to remind everyone using the site that youre capable of typing racist things rshitredditsays
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hashtag white feminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,notmyculturallysanctionedfeminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i only like feminism when it supports my preexisting beliefs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is all of reddit becoming becoming tia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women are people too notmyfeminism women deserve to make as much money as men for the same work notmyfeminism women face disproportionate gendered discrimination according to the research notmyfeminism there are many kinds of privilege and we should be aware of them notmyfeminism there are issues in the world both great and small and we should talk about them notmyfeminism women are the most privileged people of all and hate men and do easy work and get paid more for it and dont have to put up with the stuff men have to and god they are so privileged it makes me so mad i want to just kill them and dont get me started on whiney blacks who cant even work for a living and jsut rely on welfare finally my feminism i swear to sweet baby jesus this is how these awful people think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as soon as a feminist uses feminist terms you know shes one of those icky feminists how much do you wanna bet his idea of a real feminist is sommers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edit ty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,privilege is the entire reason it exists

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bourgeois feminism in a nutshell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how do you address inequality without also acknowledging privelage i dont get it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am so annoyed that twoxchromosomes is like this it angers me so much maybe too much that these idiots have taken it over and now the place thats supposed to be for women is instead telling women that theres no sexism and no oppression like im genuinely pissed right now its so fucked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit that thread is a garbage fire dea social science dont real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you think women won the vote without men you think blacks beat segregation without whites have you ever considered what would have happened if the wrong people had said no if the majority had just said no a group with no power does not simply take power they have an idea and that spreads and when enough follow that idea then things change there is always resistance as there are always fanatics kkk and blm but there is a new movement stirring one free of course and gender one based along lines of reason big conversations that will make the changes needed thank the rich white men for doing so much for you peasants many white people gave their lives to end slavery during the civil rights movement there was even the white panthers progressive male politicians deeply desired giving women the vote these are all good things but these redditors arent trying to encourage these actions theyre just trying to distract from women and nonwhite people and minimize their contribution
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as soon as a feminist uses words like whitewashed and privilege you know shes notmyfeminism at utc replied to as soon as a feminist uses words like whitewashed and privilege you know shes notmyfeminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like how they im being correct here but lets face it that poster is a guy assume feminists are women only also on a more serious note we gotta stop looking to celebrities for philosophical guidance
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i only like feminism when it benefits my dingdong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,been tia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,suddenly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for them real feminism is all in the past many of the gains made by previous waves of feminism have been accepted by the status quo for the most part but redditors like most conservatives dont want to move forward they want the status quo they know and love the status quo that continues to benefit cishet men to be perpetuated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,christina hoff sommers lmfao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so what is their idea of feminism antifeminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,real feminism is feminsim of the old days when it didnt affect them of course if they lived back then they wouldve been agaisnt those feminists too cuz thats what they do its like how they say blm should act more like mlk evem tho they parrot the same exact arguments white who opposed mlk used
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women splitting the dinner bill and having the right to vote anything else may require men to make room for actual representation of equality and is therefore invalid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess it means that susan banthony was the last good feminist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its in the list of smileys linked in the sidebar
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feminism that means i can hit women right equal rights equal lefts pussypass denied lol reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,male privilege doesnt exist which is why we have never seen a woman get passed over for a job for which she was significantly more qualified than the male applicant nope that has never happened especially not on november
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is what i didnt understand people dont talk about privilege they use it as an excuse to stop talking or thinking this has almost never been my experience of course i dont act like an ass when someone brings up privilege so it could have something to do with that ¯ツ¯
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men are the ones who shut down conversation on privilege by going on defense but of course they want to blame the people who bring it up in the first place thus starting a conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are always fanatics kkk and blm groups formed to block rights and kill people are exactly the same as groups formed to promote rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you think women won the vote without men you think blacks beat segregation without whites have you ever considered what would have happened if the wrong people had said no if the majority had just said no a group with no power does not simply take power you should be thankful white men decided to give you these rights you never deserved in the first place there is always resistance as there are always fanatics kkk and blm how many of these people have no idea what blm even stands for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but there is a new movement stirring they arent even trying to hide it are they
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i only like feminism which bears zero resemblance to feminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ackshually
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconsciousnessraising learn about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i uhh actually wrote becoming twice oops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tumblr in action its a hate subreddit that tries to point out hypocrisy in feminism but all it actually does is hate on women and minorites trying to voice their opinion i wouldnt go there if i were you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id like to see an antifeminist who can list a feminist who a isnt in youtube videos b isnt christina c isnt too dead to call them out on their nonsense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get my news from the scientist thunderfoot and the philosopher sargon of akkad reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure dude maam maybe work on your divisive language
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there have even been
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,studies repeatedly show that men perceive proper representation as over representation so when they encounter more than one token woman in their field they screech about unqualified women taking their jobs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was masturbating what are we talking about again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i could have sworn it said suddenly becoming my bad too lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but all it actually does is hate on women and minorites trying to voice their opinion now that i think about it that is exactly why i left the anti feminism train
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of the posts there are obvious satirejokes or some cherrypicked extreme cases that dont represent feminism as a whole
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikichristinahoffsommers who calls herself an equity feminist but agrees with antifeminists more often than not gamergate loved her and kotakuinaction probably still does also she works for a conservative think tank from her wikipedia article sommers has contrasted equity feminism with victim feminism and gender feminism arguing that modern feminist thought often contains an irrational hostility to men and possesses an inability to take seriously the possibility that the sexes are equal but different
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every antifeminists favorite feminist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,an antifeminist who identifies with firstwave feminism ie she agrees with the right to vote and women not being forbidden to get educated but god forbid a woman sue for harassment after being slapped on the ass by her boss
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feminism is stupid now let me tell you how my penis feels
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same here im very confused
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,omg equal but different like why call to mind the same justification for segregation its like shes trying to be a strawman or at least id think but sadly i think separate but equal still seems reasonable or at least not grossly offensive to large swaths swatches of people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also good though auditions in most fields involve speaking and not just performing for that you need httpbloginterviewingiowebuiltvoicemodulationtomaskgenderintechnicalinterviewshereswhathappened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pls incorporate communism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill do this instead of my art class homework edit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that would be kind of cool good suggestion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brdy is so cute
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this one pls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats because he was painting brd in real life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is what happens when kirby inhales an srs subscriber youd think the product of kirby inhaling a kia subscriber would be horrific right fortunately he doesnt actually get an ability or even a hat this is because kia subscribers dont do anything now i wonder what brd kirby does
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,easily chopupable if you need the four panels stacked vertically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tru brd irl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they should be happy they got a nice camp on australian immigrants in reply to minguseyes on asylumseekers even if found to be genuine refugees are confined in offshore camps until they choose to return to country of origin or go mad indefinite detention the avowed purpose of this arbitrary group punishment is to deter others from using people smugglers and avoid deaths at sea no fucks are given as to the conditions causing people to take to the sea both major political parties have defined themselves into arrival of a single boat onto australian soil as failure every time a mainstream politician decries the appalling cruelty of such policies shock jocks murdoch press and tv are employed to press racist xenophobic buttons until they are howled down its a fucking disgrace and i wont be voting for any party that supports indefinite detention in offshore camps designed to deter refugees by arbitrary group punishment at utc wrote whats the problem these people pass through fifty other nations to get to yours if there was any actual danger theyd fill out the forms at one of those countries these people are simply benefit seekers economic migrants arent refugees downvotes dont change the fact they deserve a worse fate and should be happy they get a nice camp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone talks about white genocide but nobody actually does anything that needs to change no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,smug they should be happy we so graciously let them have the very minimum requirements for survival what they think they are worthy of a house
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if only white genocide was as big a problem as the racists make it out to be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,welcome to the liberal party
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hes not wrong tough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,slavery was a problem in tibet prior to the pla occupation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,free tibet maojpg already did
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like every culture in history practised slavery how is this any argument at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair when you actually think about it no offense meant to anyone because this is my honest opinion bad things are actually good things thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair tibet practiced slavery until china invaded in reply to pppyourboat on fuck china free tibet at utc shouldbebabysitting wrote to be fair tibet practiced slavery until china invaded it would be like general lees son travelling the world and talking about the great culture of the south before sherman burned his way across their peaceful plantations leaving behind tens of thousands of starving southerners
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mao freed tibet long ago
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,alternate history redditor par souci déquité les etatsunis possédait des esclaves jusquà ce que la france envahit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for the love of everything good and sacred shut up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mao freed gotta love tankies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tanks molotov cocktails
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,am i crazy for thinking it wasnt all that bad it was a clever premise and invoking the memory of the holocaust would be a very good argument against the point the man raised
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh great this joak™ validated an actual antisemite who responded with took a quick look at his history and what do you know including its gonna be hard to not be antisemitic guess what bud its actually really fucking easy to not be antisemetic if you think its hard you might just be a bigoted asshole just another day at reddit dot com i suppose
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,about a jewish person should have given him a gold star in reply to areyouseriously on youre not wrong about that trump also has a lot of similarities to berlusconi but trump is definitely using hitler tactics to unite the country and thats just scary its just scary that such aggressive racism is coming back so much so that i see it in academia in nyc ive been told in a fucking research lab of all places how genetics is related to skin intelligence is related to skin therefore skin color and intelligence are linked via genetics this was told to me by a fucking jewish person of all people i had to bite my tongue and not point out that thats exactly what the nazis thought too ive been told how russians are garbage ive been told that interracial coupling is wrong ive been told i should know my place and be satisfied with what i have what the fuck is wrong with my culture etc just fuck this racism bullshit i really want to exterminate them all but thatll just bring me down to their level its so fucked at utc brotherche wrote this was told to me by a fucking jewish person of all people i had to bite my tongue and not point out that thats exactly what the nazis thought too should have given him a gold star
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,know whats funny the leadup to genocidal slaughter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like i understand the context but thats going a bit too far aint it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its a shitty joke to a shitty comment so it kinda equals out in a shitty way getting taken out of context here out of all the nonsense in that thread which ive been following since the beginning that was probably the least offensive lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh god i guess thats why you dont make jokes like these on reddit regardless of context or intentions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would say its weird to see in rbadscience but it got linked to in rbestof so who knows whos in there now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of the other offensive stuff wasnt upvoted though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of it wasnt a fitting rake down of a racist either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah what egg said it was more of a throw your own ignorance in your face kinda line
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,enjoy your future world nation germany at utc daybreak replied to enjoy your future world nation germany
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how every single comment here is controversial like the mrasrssucks brigade think im helping to fight the sjw menace by giving point on their general unrelated discussion post thatll show them not to mess with the altright
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of my favorite things is when reddit accuses of report brigading because of course it isnt brigading if a comment violates the rules were supposed to report it and it isnt like we can force the mods to remove it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so that big collin capernick story is circling the web right now and causing a huge shitstorm i think the dumbest part of this whole ordeal is that this all over the fact that he didnt stand up for the national anthem thats it didnt spit on a flag burn it piss on it nothing all he did was remain seated the national anthem at sports events has gotten creepily nationalistic people take it personally when you dont stand they say your against the military you hate this country etc etc whats even worse is god bless america i make a point of staying seated for that and the looks of pure anger and i hatred i get are fucking absurd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even if im taking a semester off i feel like a piece of shit for not really touching any compsci stuffi just dont know what to do to practicedick with closest thing i have is programming my game and a good chunk of that is handled by gamemakerat least i use all code actions in that thats a plus
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the next few episodes of mlp seem uninteresting for me bleh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it makes me want to try to learn how to crochet again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there was a httpsenwikipediaorgwikijosephinebaker in yesterdays episode of mlp which was pretty neat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i tried to out do my cousins wireless speaker with my jam rewind but then she brought a full sound system i demand a rematch
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt report brigading just reporting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you want some texts to screw around with i could poke around and see what i have if you wanted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hugs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least steven universe has been consistently wonderful this last season despite you know bismuth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gotta crochet em all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh god me too i cant even do like a regular sphere but when i learn how im totally making them into pokemon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tumblr is complaining though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh dont feel that you have to but if you did thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats wrong with bismuth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is pretty much cultural appropriation tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the inevitable result of cramming an entire arc into one episode some stuff just doesnt come out right like the those were some great times bismuth i sure am glad we were such good friends back in those days moments which were bafflingly stilted considering how natural reminiscences about rose have been while it was pretty well set up so that bismuths actions made sense both in immediate and wider context the final conflict between her and steven felt really awkward to me partly because i couldnt really disagree that her solution wasnt better than a seemingly endless war of attrition and waiting for the homeworld gems to just fuck off back to their home planet which only happened because the diamonds had set upset off two superweapons that wouldve rendered roses rebellion almost pointless if steven had had at least some kind of counterpoint like that her way wouldve made the crystal gems even more hated by the rankandfile homeworld gems she supposedly wanted to free and not only the very understandable littlekid view that this was just plain wrong and mom wouldnt have wanted this that and i liked bismuth and thought the ending was real sad so that colors my perception pretty thoroughly sorry if that reply was overlong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have never heard of her till the internet pointed it out wouldnt have known it was a reference
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to reference a historical figure or did i miss something i thought the main complaint on tumblr was about discord big mac and spike ogling her which i thought wasnt very valid as spike and big mac were actually ogling a booth with a table big enough for their game and discord is a character who even a casual viewer would identify as an example of how not to behave to me the potentially suggestive cutie mark was far more problematic but hey people can look at a given piece of media and see very different things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,butit wasnt necessary they were perfectly capable of bubbling homeworld gems it was needlessly cruel and i dont think that opposing whats essentially pointless torture is a littlekid view
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white folks using black bodies to sell cartoons how do you not see a problem with that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant argue with that though i do wish they had offered at least kind of a plan besides sit around waiting for homeworld gems to befriendbubble but now they have a spaceship so who knows
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because i just dont see it the way you do i look at that scene and see the animators trying to get their adult viewers to go out and look into a remarkable person that their very white male centric history class probably never even bothered to mention thats what happened with me id never heard of josephine baker before someone pointed out the reference and i went digging for information i can see after reading your comment how its appropriative but i dont view it as problematic in the way that say the attempt at inserting native american characters in over a barrel was
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if sjws got their way our world would be just as fascist the political spectrum is really a circle and if you go too far left or too far right you come to the same place dae le horshit theory is realzzz jesus christ what do these people even think sjws are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and as we all know electing a fascist is the best way to fight authoritarianism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really dont understand this whole this is why trump won thing its like white ppl know he is bad and is telling minorities they voted for him for the very petty reason of wanting to get back at minorities for calling them racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what positions of power would they be talking about like specific examples crickets
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how are we the puritans they slut shame women all the time and constantly engage in rape culture they hate on the lgbt community and constantly ignore facts proving lgbt is not a mental illness theyre intolerant of other religions other than christianity supporting a man who wants a registry for muslims evoking hitlerlike plans they constantly engage in racist behavior and are afraid of people who arent white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,which positions of power what loopholes edit i got a pm telling me guess what it is apparently if you cry sexism or racism you get power in universities lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so are we the essjaydubya overlords or are we completely useless femshills make up your mind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre so scared of a made up boogeyman leftist authoritarian regime that they elected an actual far right authoritarian
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its weird how similar this part of society is to religious puritanism weve in many respects brought back blasphemy laws you can lose your job for holding the wrong opinion even if its not bigoted youre absolutely not to question the religion intersectionalityfeminismgender theory and the people involved are similarly redefining words to suit their agenda racism sexism transphobia and the similarities between original sin and white or male privilege are overwhelming they are essentially the same exact concepts gold x yaaaawwnnnnn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait i actually want this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ironicatbig
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait what the fuck are we the new illuminati sweet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in order to save democracy we had to destroy it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this talk about loopholes is ridiculous when trump got the presidency because of a loophole he lost the popular vote by more than million votes and still won if the democrats were half as competent as people seem to think they are clinton would have won this in a landslide this doesnt even just happen on the national level even in states the republicans dont need a majority of votes to get a majority of houses theyve been gerrymandering and disenfranchising voters for decades and they are going to keep benefiting from it if this person had the slightest understanding of politics they would know this instead they just get all their news from their own personal echo chamber
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,go out onto the street redditor ask people what an sjw is i guarantee nobody will have any idea what the hell youre going on about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,christ that subreddit went to shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the concept of irony just broke again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jesus that whole thread is a dumpster fire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course its canada qalunaat qalunaat resist all changes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not oppressing people is the same as oppressing people wont someone think of the fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this was actually the worst comment section ive ever seen on here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you dont know the difference between instill and install your opinion doesnt matter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont you get it the left wing sjw nut jobs forced good people to vote for trump by not coddling bigots the sjws did trump
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can someone point me in the direction of one of these loopholes because im a pretty dedicated sjw and i still h havent been able to achieve much in the way of powerful positions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,looks like psychological projection
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sjws have used loop holes in the system to instill themselves in positions of power they then use those positions to silence those they feel have have the wrong thoughts or say the wrong things trump won because people are very tired of this type of authoritarianism in reply to on its sad that feeling are dominating rights right now edit poor choice of verb at utc itkeepscomingagain wrote one of the many reasons trump got elected and the altright is gaining power sjws have used loop holes in the system to instill themselves in positions of power they then use those positions to silence those they feel have have the wrong thoughts or say the wrong things you must conform to their ideology trump won because people are very tired of this type of authoritarianism it will happen to canada too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you forgot the biggest loophole doing absolutely everything in your power to hamstring the government in order to run on the platform that it is broken and needs to be dismantled
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,big fluffy strawmen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive always thought this dril tweet really summed up horseshoe theory httpimgurcomiavpkqw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a guy replied to a comment of mine a few days ago and he actually said something along the lines of if sjws were in power all white people and men would be murdered he was serious it was wild he also said people writing mean tweets about men should are on the same level as the kkk these people are insane
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anyone that disagrees with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so long as its a fascist that makes us feel good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jew sjw omg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a jew and a sjw do i have twice the power or does it cancel out like a double negative this is the kind of thing we need to spend more time addressing during cabal meetings
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not really they call them socialists now look at all the hate for george soros
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more supplemented than replaced tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre just passing on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its total gas lighting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its funny how even the supporters of trump need to blame somebody else for his victory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nobody i am aware of in real life voted for him because of sjws its always anything but hillary and her evil emails of doom never ever is is because of sjws of any description
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,subreddits mods since reddit is all they care about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah the puritans didnt escape to the us to escape persecution they escaped to it so that they could be the ones in charge of deciding who gets persecuted once they came over here they started fucking over and hanging all sorts of other religious sects who they felt got christianity wrong in particular the quakers were one of their favourite targets eg the boston martyrs it takes either a certain amount of willful ignorance or some dedicated mental gymnastics to equate that with hey maybe we should stop judging everyone based on their religious or ethnic backgrounds
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bc they want to stand in their moral high ground of centrism dont you know leftists and fascists are the same
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not even being sarcastic its because they have rejected or never learned the concept of moral thought entirely to them someone making a moral claim that you shouldnt do something because its wrong is the same as someone writing a law banning that thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is actually true i yelled racism once in the middle of the campus and i was made dean
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the madeup ones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the great enemy is always both menacing and unstoppable while simultaneously weak and powerless
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if we make up a fake rightist libertarian regime will they elect some kind of leftlibertarian thing out of a similar spite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i remember in the bible when adam and eve acquired material benefit from their society because they ate the fruit which made their lives better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the similarities between original sin and white or male privilege are overwhelming i mean theyre not actually the same thing but it does continue to astound me how these guys feel so intensely persecuted by the concept of male privilege
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can lose your job for holding the wrong opinion even if its not bigoted these are the same conservatives who oppose unions and support atwill employment laws
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae so intellectual xd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you got it all wrong supporters of civil rights are bad things things meaning asses in this case
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well the warrior used to mean keyboard warrior so there was an element of writing angry posts about kimonos when you could do other things it was just that some people did not like people doing anything about civil rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,omg im so happy we brought back ironicat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,welcome please collect your gift basket at reception
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being a decent person the sad thing for me is that it takes waaaay more mental energy justifying petty prejudicial and typically contradictory viewpoints over just being accepting these are mostly antiintellectual types so i imagine that since they didnt want to focus their mental energies towards productive means they just choose to be angry since it keeps them occupied
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the whole site really
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what does qalunaat mean white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that sub has been flooded by altrighters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what does that translate to literally im hoping its honkies ive always liked honkies makes me feel like a goose
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree but why would white people change as far as theyre concerned they won so it seems silly to expect them to acknowledge anything is wrong no i blame white fragility fully but i dont see how thats going to help prevent white fragility from deciding more elections in the future i have too little faith in them wanting to improve to expect to tackle the issue from their side
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think i hear a chicken batben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that ones standard politics you want to sell the nhs you dont just sell it you run it into the ground you cut it down to nothing make them fire most of their employees give them no funding for equipment double their hours slash their pay then when they strike you go tv and say theyre recklessly endangering the lives of patients whilst you sell off services a few at a time start with the small or unusual stuff then spread it from there and you keep this up for years then you can sell services faster privatising it piece by piece to the highest bidders to your friends in big business and then finally you announce the new reformed nhs how its better funded more efficient and will offer better care than the old one could even though its worse in every way than it used to be when it was nationalised still charge people national insurance though need that money for renovating buckingham palace or more chauffeur driven cars for mps and expensive booze for the bar in the house of commons they did a fantastic job doing that to national rail and to the uks domestic mining and energy industries and to our manufacturing centres and now theyre doing it to the nhs and most people will applaud like idiots when the tories announce the new nhs in a year or two
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god i wish i was fluffy like a doggo dogpalm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,horseshoe theory has the intellectual credibility of a dril tweet the entire idea is that sometimes the far left and far right as i have defined them from my nihilistic ivy league classroom use similar methods to achieve radically divergent ends ends that are superficially superfactually similar
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,which is basically of humanity thats pretty optimistic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white people cant help but feel persecuted whenever someone proposes equal treatment for them and minorities when youre accustomed to privilege equality feels like oppression basically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if sjws were in power all white people and men would be murdered this but unironically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are we not doing white genocide anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone knows trump was literally an amalgamation of hitler and saten sewn together with greed and ego but something just felt wrong about hc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if trump manages to survive years i guarantee his altright fans will hate him by the end
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its obvious once you know what sjw stands for sensual jew whisperers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whenever i see sjw written down i always pronounce it as sjew in my head
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i remember when someone in gamergate assumed that it meant single jewish woman and everyone was all meh it fits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spell it kabal then theyll believe youre casting jewish magick kaballah on them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty sure it makes you a conduit for sjw magic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nazis always accused jews of socialism jewish bolshevism was the fashionable term
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a human tradition i think i wouldnt single out white people for that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,highneffes i busted up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know some
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont forget about gaming journalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,censorship and thought policing obv
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean that i can bypass the application process for a phd in computational linguistics sweet s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i prefer it when they claim to have ever been in a gender and womens studies lecture cause either a american teaching is literally shit b they are lying and rehashing the same arguments and stereotypes they have seen online or c they lack the level of comprehension that the average year old has and are literally a fucking idiot not like they are being stupid but if you cannot comprehend privilege theory and think that it is really saying that a white homeless guy is better off than a black billionaire although out of interest i googled how many black billionaires there are apparently out of the billionaires on earth are black what are the odds then you are quite literally a fucking idiot tldr i think what i hate the most about studying sociology is the amount of people who shit on it think they are smart and are failing to comprehend basic theory that doesnt confuse a fucking former no sociology and the terms used are not a fucking religion just a field of study that you dont understand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the irony is of course completely lost on them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes as a plural i should have made it singular when that one woman posted here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant remember the literal translation and its going to bug me for a while
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hitler killed straight white men who disagreed with him the fuckers need to learn history
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so beautiful that has to be my new favorite ben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the buckingham palace restoration is over years im glad the timeframe is the same in your post ive seen things elsewhere that do not add up since the timeframes are different
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the list of everything they do sounds so utterly treasonous i dont understand how the american ones call themselves patriots with straight faces
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wish we were all doggos and we had no idea what reddit was
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,considering this years politics i agree tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was arguing with a guy the other day who thought this kind of comments were serious he was like look at how hateful you people are towards white people some of you actually want to kill all of them i honestly didnt know what to say
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe the swayed moderates would see the error of their ways but so long as they had minorities to dump the blame on his core followers will defend him to the end
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i sure hope so i cant wait to say i told you so when it turns out trump didnt hold up to everybodys expectations but knowing them they all have confirmation bias
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sjewrner truth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought jim sterling was one of our leaders too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and now its cultural marxism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah white person here others may do it but weve elevated it to an art the converse is taking credit for other peoples ideas like moveable type claiming some german schmuck came up with it when he merely improved on what the chinese had been doing for centuries
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,technically its highnehttpenwikipediaorgwikilongses it was a typographical variant of s that was becoming unfashionable in the century and extremely rare in the though less so in german
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my condolences
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they targeted gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but if you cannot comprehend privilege theory i mean obviously privilege means that no white dudes ever suffer or go through any shit and also theyre bad people and also all feminists hate them did i cover all the points
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is it outsider like someone who isnt inuit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no that bit wasnt entirely serious the rest was i just pulled from examples of misuse of taxpayers money the privatisation of the nhs has already been going on for over a decade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can be patriotic and against the government
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpiimgurcomickqvdujpg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh shit this is a circlejerk sub i was here for the genocide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,classic projection he desperately wants to kill all minorities and just assumes they would do the same to him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,first troll that baits him in office is going to cause him to rant about shutting down anonymous speech and thatll kill a lot of his fanbases frozen peach boners yes im aware the supreme court has upheld anonymous speech is covered by the amendment so dont bother pming me salty trumpers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the narrative will be carefully controlled and there will be enough doubt cast around the media that unless it comes directly from the emperors lips they wont buy it and will probably find someone or something to scapegoat the failed policies on the early appeal for universal cooperation for the coming event or whatever is enough to make me concerned that the game is to make it seem like everyone had a chance to help but then spin it so that it seems like the liberals didnt want to help you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is an understated comment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,p sure hes just one of the converted that proves our power
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually they had a term for that as well httpsenwikipediaorgwikiculturalbolshevism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,g a m e r s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this gamer doesnt really care they moan about sjws censoring watch dogs when it was ubisoft and sony and anyway we wouldnt want to censor ingame vaginas when naked men are running around with their bits out too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you forgot original sin that all white people are born evil you know that is just the basic crap taught in sociology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think so i know thats what tanik translates to the name for black folks is actually based on a really strong mythological figure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i admit i havent looked into it a lot but i had someone telling me that we shouldnt have socialized health care in the us because its turned out so awful in the uk nice to know that while they may be correct its for exactly the opposite reasons they were trying to convince me of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,moonmoon you goof
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hope not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yup the cultural marxism conspiracy theory is a continuation of nazi ideology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we never really had private healthcare nationalised healthcare came out of a period of horrific poverty and disease after the boer war in the uk at the turn of the century disease and public health were horrendous except among the richest the liberal party got in and introduced stuff like free school meals nationalised healthcare the first basis of the benefits and social care systems it came out of a place of need that society was in such an utter shithole and so many people were dying that people even the poor accepted paying directly even if healthy so they and others could have basic healthcare now weve all forgotten what that was like because none of those people who remember it are still alive we all grew up under the nhs yeah it has a lot of problems but the bulk of them are caused by a the governments mismanagement and attempts to destroy it and b that the executives and management are not usually medical professionals and are totally disconnected from the profession itself the government always puts people into positions who dont understand those positions in recent years two big ones rear their heads gove in education a man who pretty much obliterated our education system now turning an already terrible system into a complete clusterfuck and hunt a homeopath as health secretary formerly culture secretary or as he was once referred to the nhs means several things everyone even the poorest and most vulnerable people came access basic free healthcare the first priority of the medical system is the patient sexual health clinics gp appointments are free ae is free our contribution to national insurance is a fraction of what we might end up being charged for healthcare if in trouble because everyone pays the cost is distributed more evenly its deducted before you even see your income most people dont even think about it expensive and rare stuff is often not covered but basic stuff which happens more often is it is inefficient it is expensive when you look at the overall numbers but the cost to individuals and society is lower the cost of the government is covered by national insurance other taxation they wont be cutting any of that the us really does need a proper nationalised healthcare plan
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lets maybe dial it down with the gulag remarks i get the sense of frustration though itll drive you insane thinking about it too much i have some theories as to the explanation of the intersection between ultranationalism and outright treason honestly though i think it boils down to the fact that many nationalists dont even love a nation or a people at all they love a particular kind of world one where they are always in control the cost of that control will be everything its already tanked the paris accords and it looks like the eu is going to collapse i get the eu aggression more i mean the eu was just sucking people dry for german investors but its too well integrated into the european economy and its collapse would trigger a huge global downturn like were kinda fucked because of them but i suspect despite the gloom perhaps we might get lucky and pull through it all stranger things have happened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god dammit moon moon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you for this lovely explanation and agreed we very much do if only capitalism wasnt king here out of curiosity are expensive and rare procedures like cancer treatment im guessing paid for entirely out of pocket then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tadaaa although there are often private alternatives and some things that can only be done privately so often yes stuff like cancer treatment might not really be covered by the nhs a friend of mines mom had to have brain surgery for brain cancer it was a risky surgery not covered by the nhs chance of survival and it nearly bankrupted them because it was so expensive and she couldnt work for so long due to illness and recovery now theyre doing great and shes fit as a fiddle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,interesting thank you again for the info and im glad to hear about your friends mom both that shes well and heartening to hear theyre not in debt for life as they probs would be here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they were fascinating how is spewing racist memes fascinating exactly there are thousands of accounts on twitter already providing that to the world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors research into as artificial shitlording was not the research into artificial intelligence that the creators wanted because redditors exist on the lower end of the dunningkruger scale
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and research was stopped because people were offended not hurt or persecuted just offended by an inanimate chunk of code seems like a poor reason to stop such an interesting project in reply to muhnsfws on i for one remember tay the ai that turned into a nazi almost immediately she just learned everything people told her and everyone told her the holocaust wasnt real at utc wrote it sucked tays handlers had to step in and put a stop to it i wanted to see her keep going the results werent expected but they were fascinating and research was stopped because people were offended not hurt or persecuted just offended by an inanimate chunk of code seems like a poor reason to stop such an interesting project
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every ai bot that works on learning from watching can easily be manipulated get enough people to repeat the same question to cleverbot and it easily becomes a neo nazi that upsets the totally not conservatives yet we spout every ideal that conservatives do kiddies of reddit because the humans at facebook actually parsed the garbage from trending and brought up the interesting news stories of the day unfortunately for them just about every story involving a republican was about how farremoved from reality they were and what bigotry they were spouting that day not being biased isnt going to change that not when you have one somewhat sane party and one batshitcrazy party so its time to stop pretending that the gop isnt the white supremacy party when its candidate got the nomination spouting those principles and then winning a popularity contest at a kkk rally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the joak that never ends oh it goes on and on my friend some people started telling it not knowing what it was and oh theyll keep on telling it forever just because this is the joak that never ends
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you just assume when did this joak emerge ive been away for a bit joaks already stale no matter how new it is they followed it of course with their permant favorites just the word triggered and x lives matter no helicopter yet but its inevitable ironic subreddit title
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but earthlier happy is le meme unforced nbsp than that which withering within the lonely redditor nbsp grows lives and dies in angry solitude nbsp respect is earned where has this redditor ever earned any forced memes are all it takes to get respect around here unfortunately nbsp worthwhile people dont become redditors like him this brand of posting is born out of being unwanted by society that is why they cling to it so hard they have nothing else what a curious thing redditor humor one might as well speak of compassionate conservatism or white humanity for all the sense these words make together reddit humor could be replaced by dangled keys and shouted slurs and theyd enjoy it all the same
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you just assume my living status in reply to winstonsmithluvsbb on nah fuck all of that congrats on the surgery im assuming you didnt die at utc audict wrote did you just assume my living status
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unfunny borderline incomprehensible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was wondering the same thing the other day as far as i can tell its only been around for a week or two and yet it already feels more overused than triggered and le funney attack helicopter maymay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like these but i like them more when theyre not a wall
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my first death wish tears up its been a good day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well lots of them apply and i dont want to flood pasta at most per post maybe e i tried the new distribution on yet another instance of the dead horse tell me what you think please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not you them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree with the other person too many makes a wall of text made bigger because its all rainbowtext and spreading them out fills the comment section please limit it to only a few per submission in a single comment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i personally subscribe to the concept of brevity being the soul of wit between and should probably do it just fine without belabouring it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mjbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as you wish my mod
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you better apologize no seriously easy mistake to make welcome to srs enjoy the buffet and bottomless white male tears
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah redditor heart is so hard to harvest
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like saffron you only get like a couple tiny filaments from each one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there was no war in ba sing se
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ohanian just doubledowned on all lives matter being the official policy of reddit i wonder what it would take for him to stop being a chickenshit liberal if his greatgrandfather was his father he wouldve been detained when he came back on that flight is that would it take for him to be personally inconvenienced or would he just say i respect your opinions and will defend your rights to the death as they browsed through his facebook profile and asked him what his political affiliation was still no acknowledgement that reddit is literally a major platform for the unamerican actions he is observing still pretending the fight for net neutrality is over still pretending he is not indirectly responsible for this entire mess because he never curtailed the growth of white supremacists manipulating reddit to get propaganda to the front page daily
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hope serena williams gets invited to a dinner hosted by beyoncé and bs people ask that ohanian not come
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why ban any subreddits subreddit based around childporn whatever theyre not harassing anyone subreddit about sharing stories about how you rape people theyre keeping to themsevles let them be subreddit about abusing women oh wait rtheredpill exists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,right now the brigade worked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everything is wrong with thedonald
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you missed the rest of the comment which is important because its so emblematic of the trump voter mindset exactly there is nothing wrong with thedonald since it does not pretend to be something it is not worldnews and politics both pretend to be unbiased when in reality they are the epitome of censorship implication that racism sexism transphobia xenophobia and outright shitiness are okay because theyre honest aka the bugshit argument that got our president elected implication that a general disdain for a politician who exhibits the aforementioned attitudes is a bias and amounts to censorship accusation of censorship on the part of the wider reddit community and media while defending a subreddit that deletes any criticism whatsoever of its largely authoritarian dictator multiple upvotes and gold from brigadiers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so if i set fire to the guy that posted this there would be nothing wrong with that because i never pretended i wasnt gonna burn him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine actually spending money on reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every time i come to this subreddit the theme confuses me lol im guessing its on purpose to combat brigaders
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,probably the same people who think there is nothing wrong with pedophilia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just went on one post and scrolled down a little wow just wow its funny because just last week on rall i saw a post from thedonald stating how they support all races they arent racist blah blah blah seconds on a thread threw that out the window
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is nothing wrong with nazis nazicentral
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is nothing wrong with thedonald in reply to suffca on yeah how in the hell is a subreddit like rworldnews compared to rthedonald one is obviously going to be completely biased towards a certain matter at utc alpacacentral wrote exactly there is nothing wrong with thedonald since it does not pretend to be something it is not worldnews and politics both pretend to be unbiased when in reality they are the epitome of censorship
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with this dumpster fire its a perfectly good dumpster fire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a person that was banned on one of the subreddits i mod keeps coming back after each mod mail mute to tell us how totes trans accepting thedonald really is youd think theyd get the hint but self awareness is never the strong suit of that subs reader base
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree that rworldnews engages in censorship along with rpolitics but both of them are far more hateful than thedonald i dont think they understand what censorship means it doesnt mean the users downvoted me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well tbh it is a useful instant barometer of whether an opinion merits taking seriously if he posts in thedonald you just verified him as certified troll this is especially true since the decline in popularity of the manosphere over the past few years used to be those types of troll comments came from rmister or rtrp denizens now thedonald is the reliable shithead barometer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we have always not been at war with ana sing se
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ohanian just doubledowned on all lives matter being the official policy of reddit httpimgurcomdxxpofa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is rtheredpill ive seen it twice recently and havent heard of it before is it really about abusing women every post is a mile long in there and id rather just have a tldr of the sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,today i saw them getting anxious that one member of the alt right the quebec city shooter in particular might be making them all look bad heh its not fair that one guy did something violent and now everyone thinks were all violent it was pretty glorious for a moment they almost learned empathy but then they went back to jerking each other off over hatred
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny how it turned out it was a white dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i always thought of it as we have the urge to downvote the poop so we press the downvote button to indicate that its poop and it belongs in our sub 💩
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,protesting against the deportation of immigrants is virtue signaling thedonald
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao thedonald is the most ban happy sub on reddit the irony here is that thedon is the real epitome of censorship but theyre openly racist and call everyone sjws and cucks so something something freeze peach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,assumptions that lead to false conclusions must be terrible anyway why include them and i didnt realize id have to spell this out thedonald isnt bad just because its a hub for donald supporters though god knows its enough reason its also bad because it bans even supporters of trump who try to criticize something he does
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what makes rpolitics the fact that most of its users are liberal you cant even call a racist shill who has a comment history of racism a racist shill without being banned they only ban people who dont follow their rules
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,k
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its mostly about how to manipulate women into being subservient sexdispensers through emotional abuse and destroying their sense of security and selfworth every week there are stories of guys ruining long and mostly happy relationships this way and yet the red pill is forever right and can do no wrong the matrix reference is about discovering how straight relationships are all adversarial zerosum games that justify any means of gaining the upper hand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tldr we teach misogynists how to gaslight women into having sex with them literally the entire philosophy is based around that concept
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also funny how the dead people in that cartoon are all white people when the victims of the attack were by and large brown people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we are fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jfc and this is normal and okay to them i dont even know how that would be justifiable jeez
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate how theyve managed to totally appropriate that reference now too so now any time i hear someone use the phrase take the red pill i think of that subreddit and its a complete bastardization imo when i became a feminist i considered that to be taking the red pill as it were taking the red pill isnt supposed to feel good or make you feel empowered its suppose to represent a waking up from your bubble and a realization that youre part of a system thats bullshit theyve just turned it into the standard tinfoil hat we have the truth and nobody else does bullshit and the truth isnt that robots control the world or that reality is a simulation or that patriarchy sucks the truth that controls the world to them that needs to be woken up from is that treating girls nice wont get you laid it would be so laughably middleschool if it werent for the fact that its passionately modded by married adults one of whom has admitted to raping his wife
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its all dressed up in a language of selfimprovement one of the steps they suggest is to start lifting in order to increase your sexual market value to be able to spin more plates women with higher smv numbers at the same time thats where the selfimprovement part ends though and the rest is pure misogyny but as with any cult the sub is past any chance of selfawareness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its justifiable to them because they believe that women are trying to manipulate all men and playing the same game that they are they believe that all women are in relationships with men for selfish reasons money and status mostly and so its totally fine to treat them like sexual objects because they do the same thing they often use really shitty evolutionary or biological theories that they made up to support these claims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,leave it to redditors to turn relationships into a fucking free market metaphor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white person tells racist joke about blacks black person thats rude and a bit racist could you not do that white person chill bro its just a joke black person tells joke about whites white person omg thats racist to white people how dare u
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure the dapl will destroy an ecosystem displace hundreds of disenfranchised people and ruin sacred grounds but what really matters is that they are making whites feel bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its so cool to hate white people that oppressed minority that only controls of the government
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a white man how do other white people even find the energy to be offended by racism towards whites its such a nonproblem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literally no empathy or selfexamination
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,finally someones standing up for the white people clearly those protestors are sjws in disguise trying to tarnish our name s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how do white americans manage to fail at speaking english
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and there will always be people like us to laugh at them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hating on white people is so in vogue because its acceptable behavior but there will always be white people to attend up and say thats unfair or racist in reply to on this is a bullshit article meant to divide the movement nonnatives coming to standing rock is a good thing at utc polysyllabist wrote hating on white people is so in vogue because its acceptable behavior but there will always be white people to attend up and say thats unfair or racist or the tried and true pitting of middle class vs the poor they are dirty hippies who never held a job in their life distraction and division achieved no doubt in my mind the protest is as infiltrated as thoroughly as occupy was
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,native protesters hey so if youre going to be from outside of our community protesting with us please be respectful to our leaders follow our guidelines and dont treat this as some drugfueled comingofage quest for you to blog about when you get home if you would be so kind idiots what white people getting involved is fantastic how dare you be racist against us god its so common to hate against the white man now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this has never happened lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,plus if you dont like it so much maybe dont do it to other people like im a white person who hates white people jokes but i dont go around tell racist jokes either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what reddit do you post on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,way to prove the point kiddo do your homework
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the alternate universe one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,guy says the columbine shooting was too minor to still make fun of it unlike the holocaust in reply to iwantbreakfast on no it hasnt been years yet at utc nidrach wrote the problem is too much time has passed for such an minor incident you can only make fun of tragic incidents for a long time if they are sufficiently tragic they either have to be recent or spectacular columbine was just another school shooting in the us stuff like the titanic or the holocaust will stay hilarious for much longer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unflaired people are the best on rsoccer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh goddess please send all of the ephebos to therapy already
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are men like this why do they want to fuck children so bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in regards to a year old girl hot daughter at the entire video in reply to on edit hot mom at at utc bannedfromphotograph wrote hot daughter at the entire video
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shes fully clothed wtf why do heterosexual redditors always have to shove their sexuality down our throat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,finding children attractive is repulsive reddit well wait a minute
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,breeding age
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you want a serious answer i think the site has a sizable demographic who are under and a sizable demographic who are creepy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if it has vagooby put peen in it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because they can relate on an emotional level
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this post was submitted on jun point upvoted srs is the real brigade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oops srs brigaded itself again come on guys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,here come the internet police putting an end to fun and jokes through the use of the tears reddittears
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone knows the only two genders are and
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i had as much garlic bread as there are genders it would instantly create a supermassive black hole
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just a direct quote of an old garlic bread meme that a bunch of news outlets thought was newsworthy considering the overlap between the meirl subs and rgarlicbreadmemes its not surprising to see this reference on meirl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is really stupid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not serious issues nonbinary people having an identity totes serious issues not being able to be transphobic in meirl and being forced to create your own version
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah yes its le edgy meirl i wonder where theyll all go with the mod drama
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i had as much garlic bread as there are selfaware cis people id have zero garlic bread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i had as much garlic bread as there are genders id have two garlic bread at utc replied to if i had a piece of garlic bread for each gender i would have pieces of garlic bread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i posted in that comment tree before i realized it was a link from here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i had dollars every time a redditor made a good joke id be starving on pavement yeah that wasnt very funny but neither are redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this the famous reddit wehrmacht
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,srs are the real crybullies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,srs more like ss amirite xd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sharkboy and lavagirl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sonic and knuckles

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,handmaidens and feudal lords
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,malcolm and the middle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to the person reporting all these comments this comment tree is imitating a tumblr joke made by trans people to mock transphobes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,srsters and redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wario and waluigi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i had as much bread as reasons for reddit to exist id have none
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youd have like a spectrum of garlic bread like a bread continuum it would be delicious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the serious issue is making sure my anime butts and boobs stay intact in muh video games
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive seen people whine about both subs in routoftheloop but never bothered to check why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is meirl which i think is the response to the mod drama in meirl but all the mod squabbles confuse me to be honest
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im totally selfaware of course im also not white so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean benny and the jets
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when youre a jet youre a jet all the way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,woofers and subwoofers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the correct answer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that might be one of my favorite jokes out of the korra fandom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,chivalry and civil wars
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my greatest achievement online is being reported for shitposting on srs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but now meirl has mod drama and meirl has been interpreted as the edgy meirl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the way reddit works technologically makes mod squabbles both unavoidable and impossible to comprehend
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,meirl is mostly not shit meirl is where all the shitty people who cant handle a ban go
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh my god you csws and your made up file systems how far must pc culture go until we say no more
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a tiny doggo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a korra joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so it seems indeed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,both subs are shit have you seen the amount of stupid memes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,go to bed sweetie youre just cranky
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,electric boots and a mohair suit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah there was some post on tumblr a while ago claiming that korrasami was a heteronormative ship because asami was a feudal lord and korra was a handmaiden
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like somebody hates fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im there for the stupid memes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a big ol pupper
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whaty what now what does that have to do with heteronormativity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont condone rmeirls ways but the fact that they banned that stupid frog on the unicycle is a good thing i probably really do hate fun oh well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ack sorry got that reversed heres a screenshot essentially the claim was that since korra was masculine aka feudal lord and asami was feminine aka korras handmaiden the relationship was more heteronormative because gender roles whereas mako and korra had a queer and different heterosexual relationship fandom idk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,o shit waddup
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats some good logic right there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,waddup
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,here come dat boi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if a white man wants to lynch me thats his problem if hes got the power to lynch me thats my problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man so like i fall on the side of the semantics argument that it is not really appropriate to say you cant be racist against white people because i dont think that fits with most peoples use of the word racist i also can understand context and realize that this is in many ways just a semantics thing where it comes down to two established uses of the word so it makes it especially funny seeing one person in that reply chain who doesnt like the racismpowerprejudice definition but then just starts deciding what other words mean it needs malice that one doesnt ok dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if its ok for academics to define the shape of the world as a cube whats the point of education theres supposed to be a pursuit of truth and wisdom this is the furthest thing from pursuit of truth and wisdom as opposed to does this guy think theres a cabal of academics that sit in a boardroom and decide what the definition of racism is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny how redditors can only assume competence when the person in question is a sawcasm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that woman seems to be real quick to jump to sexism what if what if the place she worked sucked but she was also a bad employee not worth listening to in reply to traidep on related guardian article at utc aspiringmountaineer wrote i hate facebook and havent used it in years but that woman seems to be real quick to jump to sexism just because my boss didnt listen to me a couple times all it sounds like is she worked somewhere that sucked but since shes a woman its automatically also sexist what if what if the place she worked sucked but she was also a bad employee not worth listening to i know i know that would be mathematically impossible right s getting real sick of that trend
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all they understand are lies that reinforce their fragile little egos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean props to them for to shoehorn an entirely unoriginal joke about autistic people into a conversation about sex toys and toy story that takes some agrade lack of originality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is with these people and their irrational hate of autistic people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rprequelmemes would be so much better without that shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also the title of a post in arwarthunder right now why do i still subscribe there i havent played that game in months
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in reply to on andy vigorously plays with his toys at utc hitchikerspie wrote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,any irregular behavior any deviations from the norm no matter how slight are autistic to these people if you dont conform to the norm with helvetian precision youre inferior thats how these people think the problem is children playing with toys is the exact opposite of irregular so the joke still makes no sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think they view us as a burden on society that we have nothing to contribute because in their mind were walking genetic writeoffs so they resent us because they have to accommodate for us with the belief they get nothing in exchange for it and would rather we just be normaleven though for some of us that just isnt possible at least thats what i believe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just a joak™
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they were told they cant say retarded anymore so the just moved on to something else
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i stopped going to that sub because of that reason
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i quit due to the wehraboos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its such a high degree of unoriginality that its almost original
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in all honesty i think its because its especially mean and unwarranted theres always a sense of antipc smugness when people get into it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,except in this case its got literally nothing to do with the matter at hand i feel like they walk around thinking boy i cant wait for someone to give me an opportunity to make an ableist joke ooh ooh wait did you say something inhales
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same plus not enough variation everything became about the senate and the screeching
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they really are insufferable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these people are super smug about being assholes its insufferable have they not seen a harry potter movie do they not know they sound like a slytherin
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seems like a general lack of empathy concerning people with autism most people find overt bullying to be bad but to them doing that meme doesnt penetrate in the same way due to their low regular interaction with the abovementioned ive noticed certain demeaning wordsphrases fall out of use due to attitude shifts black father jokes and pejoratives for gay people could be the mods the center has shifted left is what im saying and i think that thescreeching meme will fall into disuse if enough people make drawnout unantagonistic explanatory replies coupled with others making short antagonistic shaming replies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one said it was a good joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they idolize the slytherins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did they not know slytherins are the baddies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,has never stopped them before see cartman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the show itself calls cartman evil very very early and often
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i never said that the show didnt my point was that the shownarrative being very clear that a certain group are the bad guys does not stop them from circlejerking over how great they think that group or person is its dumb but it is what they do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes but these little boys think the three yearold is the olympic athlete
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies when i was a boy i was taught to think of englishmen as the fivemeal people they ate more frequently than the poor but sober italians jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance however the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies thus by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy umberto eco urfascism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least nobody is downvoting the bot this time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they fail to ever explain wither how they are playing a victim or being aggressive also in the context of defending a guy who supported blackface
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one simply couldnt ask for a more beautifully selfcontained example of the sjw capacity for playing victim and aggressor simultaneously at utc holomoronic replied to aw peet i dont see any evidence whatsoever that for example loud white middleaged heterosexual cisgender ablebodied men are under threat from political correctness on campus peet said its just about these guys realizing that society is moving beyond their points of view and they are railing against the fact they are fading into irrelevance one simply couldnt ask for a more beautifully selfcontained example of the sjw capacity for playing victim and aggressor simultaneously his appearance alongside peterson on is also very telling its like the intellectual equivalent of a volleyball match between an olympic athlete and a year old httpiimgurcomxvkfrjvpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ask and ye shall receive but remember srs is the real brigade just like how they always play the victim
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol the bot changes political correctness to treating people with respect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is that why the srscreenshot is always downvoted uq
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think that might be your plugin since i dont see it on the bot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it isnt always downvoted but when it is i doubt its because the people coming over here are subscribers to rbotsrights who just got confused over the css
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh yeah i checked on my phone and so it was lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the bot totally should have that plugin going
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really hope you dont actually think we actually want all white people dead when theyre the majority of the sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rule x take it to rsrsdiscussion or if youre really interested in discussing this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i might be ruining his rep with this but he actually doesnt want all white people dead either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so the mods of askmen posted a sticky to stop bitching and moaning we dont want rapeoff color etc jokes this isnt a safe space for that go to another hate subreddit of you want that and dont cry to us when we delete your hateful comment or others call you out on it apparently this in response to a date rape joke that was deleted when users found out about that they started bitching and moaning about it in the sticky thread and i just thought it was deliciously ironic also complaining that teh feminist sjwz are taking over askmen of all places how dare they
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,according to the aclu there are people serving life sentences without parole for nonviolent offenses as petty as shoplifting a jacket siphoning gas breaking into a toolshed and trying to cash a stolen check a man rotting to death in a box over worth of fabric what a sick sad world we live in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry about posting twice in this thread i wasnt sure where else this belongs one of the gun advocates i was arguing with on each of his replies to me he would get upvotes in less than seconds theres no way people and assumedly different people each time could refresh the page and upvote this guy that quickly every time is there any way i can prove he was pulling a unidan or do admins have to see it and investigate it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why does the bot get downvoted a lot the bot that posts the shitty comments here and the bot that replies to the comments and says theyve been linked to srs do they think theyre hurting the botss feelings by taking their precious karma or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i made the mistake of actually trying to argue on this site in a morbid reality thread this morning the gun advocates on here are out of control they seem to sincerely believe that knife attacks are equally as likely to kill you as being attacked by a person with a gun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the new epic rap battles of history is bruce banner vs bruce jenner yikes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly i think that living your entire life in a prison cell could be considered a fate worse than death especially considering the hellholes prisons can be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,vs mr affluent teen yuck really yuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can report it to the admins use the contact link and theyll look into it for whatever reason the admins wont look into vote manipulation unless someone reports it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh and one application got turned down im sorry to hear that what are you applying for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ask them why they got a gun then knives are cheaper easier to conceal can be legally taken more places have more uses than a gun and are apparently just as effective at self defense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah what the fuck is up with that i would watch the tease thingy but gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it shouldnt surprise you that all of these people locked away for life over petty offenses are poor and mostly black
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unsmith
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because her daughter is regurgitating memes while being high as a kite on painkillers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for several reasons im a little more irritated by the parent comment that says future single mom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah id probably murder my daughter after this also in reply to zootimus on future single mom at utc bxncwzz wrote yeah id probably murder my daughter after this also
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so whats reddits excuse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being superiors to the browns and the eeeevil ladies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cant compete with bbc so they want to muder women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes and seriously sweetie do your homework
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hi i had to remove this post for multiple violations please read the rules and faq thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha im assuming sarcasm its hard to read between the lines over the internet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i did im super confused i see i missed putting the amount of upvotes was i supposed to submit it as a link to the comment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no now do your homework you dont want to get grounded and lose the chance to talk to your little friends do you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok so subredditdrama is low hanging fruit linked comments are supposed to be upvoted past this is a shit you disagree with post and really isnt what srs is about it happens all the time so no worries please read the rules again carefully and maybe check out several examples of what we currently have posted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks about the third one is it really a shit you disagree post if the comment says that his words are facts thats ludicrous thinking regardless of my or his view point i didnt post this because of his thoughts on td and fuck uspez i posted it because he literally thinks because he heard a few other people say it that its fact but yeah low hanging fruit no doubt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the point of that one is that we focus on social justice type topics such as sexism and racism have you recently read an upvoted reddit comment that was bigoted creepy misogynistic transphobic racist homophobic or just reeking of unexamined toxic privilege of course you have post it here this is just someone being dumb but it doesnt really have any connection to the things that normally get posted here hope that makes sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so this isnt actually shit reddit says its shit liberals on reddit cherry pick to generalize conservatives as a whole yes dumbass say this shit but it doesnt represent everyone obviously not that you said it did so if my post was bashing cis genger white males itd be aokay but this is just another safe space fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah okay sure you just keep saying that and eventually someone will believe you not today though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the fuck dude i was nice to you and everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you have more restraint than i do id reach for the banhammer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh we definitely did
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think men love these studies about which sex does better at xyz if it turns out men are good at something its just proof men are better than women if women are good at something its probably not true or men are actually better at it or its probably actually a flaw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good thing the science mods nuked that entire thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you would think le stemlord reddituer would at least watch mythbusters there is an episode where the team has volunteers do normal things one dpes waking up and getting ready for work things like preparing a bagged lunch making the bed getting dressed etc and women far outperformed men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly this dude cant type and think at the same time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive never met a single person including women that has claimed that their sex is better a multitasking mras are now using social myths as strawmen for random unsolicited sexism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sexism is bad its usually because sexism is bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if the tasks are so gosh darn easy dudebro why dont you just do them yourself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this week in the notes of the heman woman haters why girls are stupid and icky
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit hates women evidence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,science
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dude i can totally say fuck and you while typing knitting and making you a sandwich
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i bet you anything that this guy doesnt know how to cook
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women like to pretend theyre better at multitasking its usually because the tasks women are involved in are easier to perform in parallel in reply to vonr on my wife who is a nurse tells me constantly that women are much better multitaskers while having a harder time staying perfectly focused on one single thing after reading this article i can see how and why women lean toward eye contact and hand gestures it plays to their strengths anecdotal comment only at utc dgcaste wrote women like to pretend theyre better at multitasking its usually because the tasks women are involved in are easier to perform in parallel the truth is that the capacity for focusing on tasks is based on the individual and not on the gender
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or its laydee stuff that they dont want to be doing anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,another win for the srs cabal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rscience seems pretty good about not allowing their shit users bring their discussion quality down whether its lgbtq issues or sexism or scientific racism etc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair i feel that is mostly do with stereotype enduced experience
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be honest ive heard the men cant multitask spin of this countless times
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,both multitasking and singletasking are valuable skills for different situations if you work in an airport control tower you should know how to have extreme focus on a single task if you work in a hospital you need to disperse your focus across different tasks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you know feminists believe women are made from sugar and spice and everything nice while men are made out of the off cuts of animals so much for equality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have its still stupid though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sidenote that flair is the tldr of reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for real though if you could make me a grilled cheese that would be nice because depression is trying to kill me again i agree with you though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,our nonexistent brigades are working
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its almost like they want to keep the discussions about science or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my mom works at an elementary school and quite a few years back around or so she had to take a workshop about how boys and girls are different it was pretty baffling to me they taught things like how boys are violent trouble makers girls follow directions better and can multitask better boys learn math quicker girls are more artistici was in high school when she was telling me about it and she thought it was very useful and i kept saying how ridiculous and fucked up it was the staff of an elementary had to take a mandatory workshop to teach sexist gender stereotypes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my husband says this all the time but hes the only man ive ever met of which its actually true hes hopelessly singlethreaded and his whole brain freezes up if you feed him too much information at once its a little frustrating but ive learned to be tolerant because if you give him time to think hell come back with the optimal solution and be able to tell you exactly why its optimal and how he worked it out meanwhile im multithreaded but often miss the target because i havent taken everything into account so basically hes a sniper and im cover fire we both have our uses we do make an excellent team anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,multitasking is actually one of the most important skills for air traffic controllers but your point is still right each has its place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you asked so nicely id be happy to make you a grilled cheese
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where else would it start 😄👍🏻
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we once had a teacher guided discussion in elementary school where we discussed girls being better at english and boys being better at math and science
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes thats true i hope people understand my point tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont agree
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you plug your ears shut your eyes and scream really loud its really easy to see there are only genders and no one else exists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not sure why youre being downvoted im a straight male who gets fucked by time warner all the time a beautiful way to tie it all together i upvoted every comment in that chain now lets discuss singlepayer medicine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how is sexuality a spectrum and gender isnt how fucking dense are you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was really nice of him to find a way to shoehorn his hatred into a thread that had nothing to do with gender just a really great contribution to the conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,srs brigading its own threads again when will the admins ever do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like how people always forget about intersex people tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just commented on another subreddit explaining that gender even sex to a degree not only exists on a spectrum but it can also be shown scientifically when babies are exposed to the opposite sexs sex hormones in the womb it actually alters their brain to be more like that sexs brain make up there isnt a huge difference between men and womens brain but there are some those with normal exposure generally display behaviour stereotypical of their biological sex girls tend to be a bit more social and boys tend to be a bit more aggressive those with a mild exposure display mixed behaviour and those with a significant exposure display mostly the behaviour of the opposite sex so this absolutely creates a gender spectrum now the studies arent perfect because obviously gender is a social construct so while cortisol male sex hormone causes more aggressionrambunctiousness behaviour we cause an even bigger divide by encouraging boys will be boys and discouraging girls from such behaviour however it does shows that a gender spectrum is something totally natural
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have they not heard of david bowie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not sure why youve been downvoted sexuality is a spectrum it is gender that is not in reply to hardii on sexuality is just a spectrum be what you want to be at utc lewisplqbmc wrote not sure why youve been downvoted sexuality is a spectrum it is gender that is not httpiimgurcomhpoowvcpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,government get out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah why draw the line there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe if gender was a spook
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because spectrumism is obviously not a spectrum its a binary of two things only one can be a spectrum and the other cant be its simple logic really
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id prefer corporations getting out myself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because hating gay people isnt as trendy as it used to be theyre cowards who dont stand up for shit but will go after things they think they can get away with edit fuck i missed the removed reply to me anybody know what it said theyre always my favorite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because its now becoming more socially acceptable to be queer but genderqueer is still novel status quo warriors dont question their preconceptions until theyve had their hand thoroughly held and everything spoonfed to them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rcompleteanarchy is leaking it seems
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everything is a spook comrade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean a spectrum has to be confined by two contrasting extremes im having trouble wrapping my brain around this sentence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so if spectrumism is a binary whats its correlating spectrum or does it only work the other way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,true i was mostly copying one of the gadsdens flag spoofs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats whats most crazy to me these transphobes are probably the same people who were homophobic years ago how do they not realize their view of trans people will change in the next decade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we dont respect the arbitrary borders between subs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spooky if tru
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no step on snek
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh youve stepped on me a big business pardon me let me lick the dogshit from your black leather shoes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not all of them will change their views look at conservative politicians last decade they were openly antagonistic toward gay people even in blue states now theres still some of that but its significantly less and most of them just dont say anything and attack trans people instead i dont believe for one second that the political party that was once pushing for a constitutional amendment to outlaw gay marriage completely changed their beliefs in a decade they saw a losing battle and moved onto the next outrage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like terfs how can they not see that theyre being pointlessley exclusionist celebrating one marginalised group yet demonising another
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spoopy if fals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pwease no steppy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i specifically requested the opposite of this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the weirdest thing is how they all have retconned it to pretend they never had anything against gay people like gurl only of americans were for the legalization of homosexuality as recently as the and now some people act like homophobe is some baseless ridiculous accusation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its easy with terfs its hatred theyre not on forums making jokes about people marginalizing people and not even thinking about it afterwards theyre out there actively searching out trans people and trying to hurt them by outing them preventing them from gaining access to safe spaces etc i cannot think of any other reason that would explain their behavior other than a seething hatred
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,les spooky if suparposeetion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even more recently you can see evidence of how obvious the retcon is in at a primary debate a hall full of republicans booed a gay soldier who video called in from active duty to ask about dont ask dont tell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,christians have a worse recruiting strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck that i hate that shit love the sinner hate the sin there was a christian baseball player that said that about his gay teammate and everybody was praising him for it no dude if you say you hate a huge part of who that person is youre a selfrighteous piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fucking whites and their heathen religion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love the lengths religious people will go to to not take responsibility for their own beliefs by that i mean how they wont really go to any lengths they gurgle out this excuse and expect us to believe it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow what a righteous and kind individual sorry i mean selfrighteous and misguided
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love you but i dont want you to be you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that calling homosexuality sinful is not hating gays but in fact quite the opposite christians who believe homosexuality is sinful see these people has having been deceived and on a path to destruction the only loving thing we can do is warn them about it at utc exiledsanity replied to what are you sick of that calling homosexuality sinful is not hating gays but in fact quite the opposite christians who believe homosexuality is sinful see these people has having been deceived and on a path to destruction the only loving thing we can do is warn them about it to not warn them of this would be truly hateful akin to seeing them going down a river in a canoe approaching a large waterfall and telling them how great of a job they are doing steering their canoe while letting them continue to their destruction without warning
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its easy for catholics and protestants to play these mental games because they have that whole venal vs mortal sin thing but in orthodox christianity where there isnt such a divide and sin is sin the hypocrisy is blown wide open they care a lot more about sinful gays but a lot less about sinful people who have sex outside of wedlock who masturbate etc and remember sin is sin in orthodoxy all sins are equal and all sins can be forgiven by god
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,christianity is a sin you are deceived and on a path to destruction heed the warnings sinners
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,love how they complain about brigading when they see the srs bot except no post is in minus numbers and the main post has more upvotes than when it was linked now if youll excuse me i have an admin i need to go and perform gay sexual favours for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i dont hate whites cis mails i just hate everything they do and everything they stand for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love you so much im going to tell you that you will suffer eternal torment for trying to act on love which is an immutable part of who you are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i hated them i wouldnt care what they did to not warn them would be hateful then i guess hate us then because this condescending i dont hate you just what you are bullshit is literally infuriating also nobody asked you why do the devout ones feel the need to make their opinion on everything known as if it matters to anyone but then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anyone else get a pm from user u sjwssuck apparently theyd like to have a conversation but arent adult enough to do it here in the thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you preach that an entire group of people is sinful and a corrupting influence on society the logical conclusion is that society would be better if those people didnt exist somewhere down the line someones going to get it in their head to remove them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,end religion edit also rchristian rtruechristian and rislam should probably go on the lowhanging fruit list the content ive seen from these places is really predictable and kinda ehh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just another redditor trying to pass their bigotry as something else what else is new
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least dolphins have a recorded history of accepting homosexuality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how does one get recruited into being a duck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fucking hate white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder how theyd react to love the christian hate christianity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i might be a spiteful angry mean piece of shit but even i wouldnt wish eternal torture on someone like if you just believe that happens and are sad about it thats one thing fundies seem to revel in it though and thats completely different warped fucks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even better because i love you i dont want you to be you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that doesnt bother me nothing wrong with wanting to discuss something with your particular community and having nonbelievers disagree with them would only embolden them because they loooooooove those verses about nonbelievers being nothing but fools
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a loosely defined christian i hate that christianity should be based around a personal relationship with god and that comes with struggles gatekeeping like that is just not okay i cant claim to justify what the bible says nor do i claim to be a very pious person who devoutly believes in the trinitytm like they want but you know i cant ever believe that if there is a god they think anything but cishets are sinful cannot will not and i cant justify that with scripture but i will not perpetuate it people like this make me want to give up on the whole lot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah all the time haha
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,true im disappointed in my brethren over at rislam we could be better but we choose to hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,very real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but i dont think youve highlighted anything unusually offensive here the fact that it isnt unusual is one of the issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the first step is a lifetime of disney
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a lot of pauls writing depends on nonbelievers disagreeing with them its built on a persecution complex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how much do you love carlos condit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also christian its one of the hardest parts of my faith to understand any other sin is easy to recognize as harmful towards myself or another person or as an affront to god i could understand if all christians were called to celibacy in which case wed all be called to deny ourselves in the same way and all share the same struggle but thats not the case for whatever reason so i feel exactly where youre coming from and i wish i knew how to explain it too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was you and then i did and literally no one even cared why even though i tried to discuss why with so many of my friends so that just confirmed my leaving basically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just reddit most of reddit is fucked up and hateful reddit christians reddit atheists reddit gamers reddit everything sucks if all atheists were like the atheists on reddit id just be utterly ashamed luckily most religious people and most atheists are genuinely ok people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont hate white people i hate white culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a mega fuck lot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thankfully im at a church where the majority of people are progressives and they are the key people – ministers young leaders etc so i can talk to people about it and have them be like yeah i understand that and struggling is normal and so on coming out is another whole deal entirely though but its nice to see people who lead the childrens programs in my church speak out online in support of trans rights and against discrimination
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most people are cool but if asshats are even of humanity thats still million asshats million is not an insignificant number i suggest we ban people andor nuke the earth any objections
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who do you think really controls alex jones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you hear hes fighting maia at
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,smash capital smash the state and eat the rich
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yup thats an insanely touch matchup for him id probably combust in a ball of joyous flame if he finds a way to submit maia could you imagine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hed have to elbow his face off or kick him so hard he forgets how to jiu jitsu but i can still see it happening given bisping etc happening recently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe pope francis should start by apologizing for calling us unfit to be parents or saying its inhumane and criminal to allow gay couples to adopt children at utc pageone replied to maybe pope francis should start by apologizing for calling us unfit to be parents or saying its inhumane and criminal to allow gay couples to adopt children guess theyre better off dying in an orphanage right pope francis on samesex marriage it is a destructive pretension against the plan of god we are not talking about a mere bill but rather a machination of the father of lies that seeks to confuse and deceive the children of god and according to the churchs official catechism they believe homosexuality is an unnatural disorder which cannot be condoned under any circumstances policies and stances which by the way the pope has done absolutely nothing to condemn or change and yet there are still dumbasses who think that just because the new pope doesnt look like a sith lord hes totally down with the gays httpiimgurcomcitdibhpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fat people need to have self control and eat less ugh eat the whole donut fatty starting to think reddit has an eating disorder what with how unhealthy its thoughts on food are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ew fat people are so gross they really need to have some personal accountability and consider the unhealthy lifestyle choices they are making wow only half a donut cmon you cow just eat the whole thing youre already fat anyway this is your brain on reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i find donutrelated misogyny so confusing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it could not at all be because maybe doughnuts are extremely filling and people already had breakfast
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i work in an office of mostly women and we do this so everyone can try each donut trust me we eat the equivalent to a donut and then some every time we just like sampling sorry for doing things not in the way the logical stem straight white men want us to lets have more jokes about offices full of women that i a person who has works in an office full of women for years has never been able to relate with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even if larger girls ate salad or fruit or somethingfatphobes would assume that larger girls are trying to get a man to love them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean maybe it wasnt because they didnt want to get fat maybe they wanted to share the stuff
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you dont eat all of it the calories dont count right women calory counting jokes women bad at math jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or theyre at work and they have shit to do they might be busy and not get to finish their food
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just eat the whole damn donut we all know you go home and eat a pint of ben and jerrys every night anyway youre not fooling anyone sheila at utc steelydanzig replied to just eat the whole damn donut we all know you go home and eat a pint of ben and jerrys every night anyway youre not fooling anyone sheila httpiimgurcomjyssjjdpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all they upvote in the food subreddits are pictures of greasy burgers noodles and desserts edit oh and how can i forget barely cooked steak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ohh yes i was having a salad at school one day and got a ton of oh are you losing weight thats great
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah like sure maybe they took two halves but maybe they only wanted one half and later got hungry again maybe they wanted to have two flavors without stuffing themselves wow a veritable rainbow of possibilities none of which involve assuming that women are villainous at every turn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you dont eat all of it the calories dont count right um yes actually if you dont eat a whole donut you wont be eating the calories of a whole donut i just what
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its almost like if you eat half of something youre only consuming half the calories of it i dont even get the joke here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but theyre men so its not gross if theyre fat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i donut find it to be funny wow as your relevant username i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah salads are tasty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also have you ever eaten a donut they are so sugary that i usually cant finish one in a sitting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shitty comment aside thats pretty cool thanks ysk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im guessing that they asked it to be edgy but a speech from hitler is still a historic speech and would be quite valuable for somebody studying hitler or to listen to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dispite obviously being a horrible person hitler was indeed know for his great speech skills
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im so sorry i just found that and have been waiting for a time to use it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe you could actually listen to these speakers instead of just making edgy joaks also im glad to have this knowledge mostly because now i can open spotify and listen to that stupid line from reagans irancontra speech and laugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rshitwehraboossay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youshouldknow that spotify has a bunch of historic speeches on it top comment no hitler at utc tzarkoschei replied to no hitler
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre not even trying any more so why should i
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im guessing theres legal issues with it in germany theyve banned a lot of nazirelated stuff there heck even mein kampf only just got unbanned this year
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you are not wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,which one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that sub would be good if they didnt ban every socialist coz apparently all socialists are stalinists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im fucking a not bright person i think sometimes i can win in an argument
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mein kampf was never banned bavaria just owned the copyright and didnt license reprints it has now licensed a commentated reprint something similar would probably be he case for his speeches nazi symbolism is also only banned outside of artistic and historic contexts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think you are right if i remember correctly when they released wolfenstein the new order in germany it was a different version than the rest of the world all nazi symbolism was removed and i think all references to the regime being nazis or even german was too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a few months ago i told the american people we did not trade arms for hostages my heart and my best intentions still tell me thats true but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i didnt know about that but i know that the sub has its problemsthey use the r and fslurs way too much among other things however i appreciate the counternazi circlejerk for the other moments of silliness even though it goes too far sometimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well we know who gingrich learned from
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people with bullet made holes have way too much power in attempted murder accusations
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont someone think of the rapists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so many prorape posters on this website
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nothing gets reddits dick harder than a false rape accusation story
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow what a shitty person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,once again reddit votes to make everyones life equally shitty instead of trying to make everyones life better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont you hate when someone accuses someone else of a serious violent crime and we believe them the galls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill take shit ignorant assholes say for alex edit ohnoes my upboat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,meanwhile serial rapists get one day jail sentences
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,never mind that the conviction rate for sexual assault is pitifully low and never mind that thepower of accusation isnt any different from other crimes lets not have real life get in the way of there narrative that the menz are totes oppressed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,false rape accusations occur more than actual rape think of the white men reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women have way too much power in sexual assault accusations at utc fatisbac replied to woman have way too much power in sexual assault accusations how do you think that man feels after his wife believed the disgruntled nanny over him from how the article is written it makes it sound like she took the child to the hospital for testing and not the cops so not only was this dudes reputation prolly wrecked he now knows his wife doesnt trust him httpiimgurcomuwrvzmcpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stop raping ppl tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,leave the bot alone dipshits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,get out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you put the butt in rebuttal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literally none of us care
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nobody cares
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mrw redditurds want to have valuable conversation with me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is why i voted for brexit we know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,commie lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow so this user is a literal neonazi some gems from their history include africans have an average iq between depending upon where you go the few who are intelligent enough for large scale commercial agriculture are swamped and hampered by those who are not nothing of value will be produced from africa without whites or east asians and i agree that the western world is the way it is because western men have become weaker women follow men men have become weaker because their lives are easier struggle makes the man you have control over improving yourself as a western man you cant control feminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone i disagree with is a communist the average redditurd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,childless ooh nice mention that she didnt reproduce with a man a woman without a man is their greatest weakness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so then why do leftists support them this is what rworldnews actually believes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,childless commie whore of satan you say that like its a bad thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,looks like ive found a new flair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is simply too much liberal for me fam
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everybody in that thread watched children of men and went thats what i want britain to look like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i never understood how rock against communism was a thing nor how rock against communism was meant to be the antithesis of rock against racism thanks reddit for opening my eyes to white supremacy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sometimes i wonder why i havent unsubbed from worldnews but then i remember that if you cede defeat to nazis trying to appropriate ostensibly neutral forums then youre giving them a small victory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,facehoof childless commie whore of satan implying any of those things are legitimate criticisms like childless what the hell is even meant to be implied by that like how dare you not go through the painful process of child birth you whore all kinds of mixed signals here like and communist like what how dare you attempt to address economic inequality in any meaningful fashion you whore of satan like why is it always about sex i mean like i get it the peen but can we not let that motivate literally everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok i had to change my flair for this one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to borrow a phrase from wonkette he seems nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a clusterfuck of a thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is literally the first time i see childless as an insult im pretty sure this would never be an insult for a man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how dare a woman not have children
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes but tell me how you really feel
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on merkels plea not to reject muslim refugees this is why i voted for brexit you have no say in our nation you childless commie whore of satan at utc rowanwell replied to this is why i voted for brexit you have no say in our nation you childless commie whore of satan httpiimgurcomklnwphxpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have fun getting kicked out of the european trade zone and all the economic problems that will come with that if you dont want her to have a say
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and it wont even work as intended britan will almost certainly be part of the european economic area which means that they still have to accept free movement of people httpwwweftainteea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this point i really feel that rworldnews should just be classified as lowhanging fruit i see so many posts coming from there on this sub nowadays each with a disgusting whitesupremacy tone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,commie when youre so british you use americanisms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the boogeymarxists are coming to get ya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its funny because even the actual spd ditched socialism a long time ago too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,improving yourself as a western man the irony of being a deeply ignorant shit rejecting the fruits of western enlightenment and simultaneously imagining yourself as the übermensch
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sadly this is not even surprising in rworldnews you report these people and they rarely ban them and if they do get banned by posting something particularly extreme it takes them minutes to make a new account and get enough karma to get right back to it this is a default sub and this is one of the top comments its not something you have to go seek out in a quarantined sub or somewhere specific its something that is shoved in everyones face reddit is broken and is becoming a breeding ground for violent extremists like these people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you have control over improving yourself as a western man feminists are the reason i dropped out i believe this is what they call hamstering
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,average iq between hooh boy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im expecting lowfi punk infused first wave black metal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how do they call themselves the altright when theyre indistinguishable from talk radio fox news
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you say that like you agree its a bad thing to be a communist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of the most powerful women in history no children failure as a person reddit logic in action folks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to rworldnews a leftist is anyone who is not a genocidal neonazi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,agreed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,le real progressive movement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rock against communism was a thiny veiled white power music event
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nor how rock against communism was meant to be the antithesis of rock against racism because capitalism is a racist system anticapitalism threatens their white privilege especially when its anticapitalists who are opposing western imperialism abroad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these people are a virus after they take over one subreddit and turn it to shit they will move on in search of new subreddits to infect and destroy they even tried to take over rlgbt for a while until the mods cracked down on them the mods that are standing by and doing nothing while they swarm in bear the full responsibility for letting it fall to the neonazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same with whore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rworldnews should just be classified as lowhanging fruit im in favour of this rworldnews has become the less shouty rthedonald
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i do not feel like a default sub should ever be considered low hanging fruit the defaults are made up of the literal shit that reddit says
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im personally not in favor of the low hanging fruit rule to begin with to put this in a metaphor low hanging fruit is the most likely to drop off and grow a new tree i mean we dont subscribe to dont feed the trolls crap because calling them out helps others see them for who they are even if they do enjoy the attention yet we too are sweeping the more hateful subreddits under the rug as though just because theyre intentionally hateful subreddits they get a free pass to not only continue to fester among themselves but spread to other subreddits with impunity until they say something on a default that we do catch i mean whats the point of yelling at shit when were saying nothing about the leaking septic tanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey now i managed to find pure homophobia there it sings many horrible tunes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were comin for that toothbrush
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we will never forgive you ebert
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel like anyone who brings up iq on some level knows theyre not the brightest bulb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,something something bell curve
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know those words but that sentence is breaking my brain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because those are too liberal for their taste
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont intend to sound that way seeing as i am one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,genocidal neonazi race realist my good cuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me too thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was thedonald before thedonald existed its been shit forever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,less shouty and shitposty more oriented towards biotroofs and le logical reasoning about the sjw terror that is threatening their ❄🍑
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as far as i know shit reddit says refers to opinions that are shit but also can be considered representative of reddit people on the low hanging fruit subs are somewhat obviously horrible while srs seeks to highlight that the normal subreddits and redditors tend to be pretty awful too which ties to the score requirement and the fact that the defaults are never low hanging fruit because reddit admins themselves chose them as something representative and the low hanging fruits produce too much shit for one subreddit to handle so theyre generally categorized further with rthebluepill ragainstmensrights etc being busy enough with just one slice of the reactionary cake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah yes the classic i dont know how to differentiate between private and personal property
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even shatner who earns more money with more fame didnt last the week
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is not a government it has no obligation to give neonazi scum a platform
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly fox pretends to care about minorities and poor people as long as it fits within their perception of capitalism the alt right are just straight up openly racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha me too thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,minutes after the orlando shooting was announced they came flooding in trying to sell us on trump and islamophobia in every post and comment the same shit they do in rworldnews really the mods eventually started banning them and they were forced to go if the mods did nothing it would have been a clone of thedonald within a week
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there was a distant time where all you had to worry about was that occasional asshole who always tried to bring up israel but that is only a faint memory now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not saying it was a paradise of rational free thinkers but imo it wasnt that bad before the emergence of subs like thedonald but maybe thats just some form of cognitive bias
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats an understandable mistake to make imo considering the modern context of the term private property
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that was screamy i feel like i just took a warm bath with scratchy soap how do people find these things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the great thing about this song is that itll sound exactly the same on laptop speakers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,marxirl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow i think that was over years ago just realized ive been on reddit for a while and the shit really has gotten worse i think the downward spiral may have been around the trayvon martin killing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its gotten worse probably but it was always really bad when it came to islamophobia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its an acquired taste
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black metal dude weird genre but some amazing music
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thedonald is a sub that openly uses the f slur and where the top mod is famous for being an alt right personality who hates liberals and opposes gay marriage these people have no self awareness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rworldnews is honestly one of the first subreddits to turn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,agreed new atheism is one of the urcirclejerks on reddit and thats sadly made islamophobia a fixture for many years
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it seems like the only muslims they care about are the palestinians because then they can fill an entire page with antijewish screed and be justified
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but but but milos a gay man he cant be a homophobe hes just a sexual realist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly they view the conflict as muslims vs jews so the side they support depends on how much they dislike muslims arabs or jews there are also conspiracy theories about how jews control the world despite making up of the worlds population and how they want to flood white christian countries with arabs have you heard of the nwo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hardly the time for dae europe and britain are superior type stuff
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have you heard of the nwo have i im creating a webcomic involving a bunch of conspiracies my friend according to my research for said comic the nwo is in charge of everything and is a pawn of the illuminati both controls and is controlled by the clintons is run by the israelis wall street the bilderbergs the russians the chinese big oil and reptilians and is both watching you right now and monitoring your every move and is only being stopped by the might of american freedom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also the sandy hook shooting was a hoaxfalse alarm operation so that the government can take away our guns and obama is secretly a muslim from kenya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh didnt you hear it was actually a hoax to drive up blood bank donations because
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder how different this thread would look if it was about blm paraphernalia being banned from school property at utc businesstransactions replied to i wonder how different this thread would look if it was about blm paraphernalia being banned from school property
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,never can tell with those latino girls i dated one and freaked when told me she was only looked all day long in reply to ukani on when she said she was a full time student i thought yeah she looks like a full time college student never would have guessed she was in high school wtf at utc killerinyourcloset wrote never can tell with those latino girls i dated one and freaked when told me she was only looked all day long httpiimgurcomsuuyevfpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,about upvotes earlier in the last hours its up to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,male
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sexuality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this reads like satire this is basically the mra equivalent or what if you were on a deserted island you have to be a on a ship honestly not the most common mode of transport b on a sinking ship which basically never happens c on a ship without enough lifeboats which also doesnt happen its like the biggest nonissue ever im pretty sure urinal explosion a problem i just made up is a bigger problem for men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,never let go jack
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,post about the scouts being sexist post talking about how oppressed males are think of the men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was literally men who established these sexist rules
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant believe white males are so desperate to feel discriminated against that they use this terrible argument
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,luckily not only will safety regulations ensure more than enough lifeboats for everybody but the ohsoprevelent birkenhead drill isnt fucking used anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,apparently equality feels oppressive when youre used to privilege this was actually said about women unironically i need to go throw something heavy now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if its so cursed by all means let the fempire cut it off for you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes because women and children first is the law and not just an expectation of kindness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these guys care about boat protocol but they dont give a shit about libertarians making jokes about pinoshit pushing leftists out of helicopters over the sea fucking hypocrites
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where are they getting the idea that the women and children first rule still exists beyond children i think most people agree they should be helped first i feel like they watched titanic once and never opened a history book or watched the news ever since
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there to save the day from those evil feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemales again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this but ironically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the way it is right now if im on a sinking ship and there is not enough lifeboats im shit out of luck because i was born with the cursed peeenus indeed women still face manspreading mansplaining the word bossy being paid of what men do for the same work and in addition to these fictional problems theyre also nearly a third of all homeless and barely two thirds of all college students if this isnt oppression what is at utc yomothaflippin wrote ayyy lmao i wish i was descriminiated like that the way it is right now if im on a sinking ship and there is not enough lifeboats im shit out of luck because i was born with the cursed peeenus i wish the main way my country descriminiated against me was by saying that i was bossy instead of sending me to war as soon as things go south
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how he not only assumes its a thing he assumes its a recent thing cant wait for the new year amiright
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember when this scenario happened like twice one hundred years ago and it is still held up by mras and other assorted trash men like it is the law on the books to this day because they have no other examples of men being the oppressed class
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone said a thing in a movie about a mode of transportation ive literally never taken therefore help im being oppressed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah it really sucks that every boat is the titanic and nothing has changed since then also its unfortunate that we cant just fly instead of travelling by sea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on a ship honestly not the most common mode of transport eh depends on where you live im from new york and some people in nj commute across the hudson using ferries however b and c are still in effect and most new jerseyans still use the highways httpsenwikipediaorgwikipathtrain and commuter rail to get to work so its only slightly less of a non issue if you live in the tristate area
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,save the peeeeenis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont somebody please think of the cispeens
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,notallmen seriously these are people incapable of nuance they dont believe in the concept of the patriarchy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you gotta invent persecution you may as well make it ridiculous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nor was it ever used there are a tiny handful of examples of it ever happening only three in all human history with one being a god damn floating restaurant then theres the issue where men have a survival rate whilst women have a survival rate in historical ship accidents that resulted in sinking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but but but what if they find themselves on a ship and also years ago
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it wasnt ever actually used
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit haha thats one of my favorite quotes and it being used to be about women is really really funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it isnt the law nor was it ever actually tradition either its a myth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a myth that only happened like twice and isnt even a very good idea you had to have at least one person on each lifeboat who knows how to do lifeboaty things else youre fucked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where are these situations even occurring where there is a lack of lifeboats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also the titanic was in the middle of the ocean while the nyc ferries are just crossing the river even if you cant swim to shore there would be rescue boats there in minutes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that doesnt really change my statement though its not even remotely close to the other modes of transport the post is about a systemic issue they believe exists individual areas where some portion of people use boats is basically irrelevant even in those areas it is not close to the main mode of transport
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,didnt even think of that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know the argument is still absurd i just felt like pointing that particular factoid out is all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the extra es would indicate its a joke but without a s we may never know if hes mocking mras or is one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do people hate trans people we did nothing to you wtf like at least leave us alone please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,carrie fishers death is so awful im so torn up about it

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean at first i was gonna be like ok maybe i should ease may be bad but wont automatically be better nope never mind i am emotionally numb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man i really thought she was gonna be fine especially considering people said she was on a stable condition
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i heard from somewhere that the saints row series are smart games that tried real hard to be dumb while the gta series are dumb games that tried real hard to be smart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just bought saints row during the steam sale but i havent had the chance to play it yet i really like gta but i wish theyd release an update to extend the story rather than just online updates so im hoping saints row will quell my need for interesting scumbag story
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and its great tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know ill be downvoted but anyone in the us who works for tips knows that black people are far less likely too tip doesnt mean they all are going to stiff you but i delivered pizza for years and managed a drive in fast food place for and there is definitely a pattern nopejpg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what sort of business dya have in mind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being in stable condition generally just means her body is still working you can have absolutely no brain activity and still be considered in stable condition unfortunately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is a good way to put it saints row iii has an almost perfect level of camp and iv parodies every other video game genre quite well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do so many americans blame poor people for not tipping instead of their employer for not paying them enough wages to make a living its quite clear who is exploiting them here and its not black customers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its not a really fair comparison my bad i never liked lwse but youre correct they dont deserve to be compared to fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not only is this disgusting as fuck theres not even a bit of empathy for this traumatic accident holy fuck reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all who upvoted this shit please do us a favour and go to voat permanently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit where hypersexualizing little girls is healthy

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was uncomfortable reading that shit and im an impenetrable white man child abuse isnt funny ever i dont get why its funny to joke about pedophilia at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but they used a meme face showing its just an edgy ironic comment that doesnt enable and encourage real pedophiles its not like reddit harbours a growing pedophile community oh wait
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because a child cannot actually be trans of course or a parent ever show actual support to their child
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how dare they try to make taboo subjects more socially acceptable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its only a political message when its something i dont like though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how there they bring social issues into my tv shows its about ethics in tv sitcoms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuckin sjws at all in the family bringing up interracial relationships tv should stick to making me laugh at poor people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trans people existing the liberal agenda apparently

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just because something is a controversial topic doesnt mean you cant be totally wrong about it take climate change for example
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a trans person supported by their parents in my america
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its almost as though these people are reacting to the world changing around them when has that ever happened change is always greeted by love and kindness especially by those who dont stand to gain anything from it edit fuck reactionaries
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,negative reactions are absolutely natural that doesnt mean that they cant be criticized however
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and this is why you dont invite shitstains into your online community even if you later ban a toxic sub theyre never going to leave once they integrate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey if we start harassing and making fun of people with cancer will they eventually have an epiphany and seek chemotherapy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that entire thread is a mini fatpeoplehate capsule theres a lot of material for an effort post here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you cant tolerate giving that video a listen its essentially a guy flipping out about a woman struggling with addressing her weight issues in the show shes admitting to the fact that she needs to change for her health but is struggling emotionally mentally and physically with the task at hand the narrator uses these struggles as evidence that shes a bad person that just needs to suck it up its basically just a severe misunderstanding of how to help people these narrator and all the circle jerkers in the comments genuinely think just insulting people will solve problems its literally a bully mentality he repeatedly talks about calories in calories out without addressing the other issues its this inability to understand the minutia and emotional underpinnings of eating disorders and weight issues that is so fucking frustrating they basically want overweight people to self flagellate and beg for forgiveness and admit that theyre bad people before theyll leave them alone highlight quote from that shitty video was there were no people with these conditions in auschwitz like jfc dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how can you miss something thats all around you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate reddit why are people such dicks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i miss fatpeoplehate found the fatty at utc replied to i miss fatpeoplehate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you just now compared someone with cancer to someone who is fat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah very spot on there its like telling a drug addict well um just stop yeah ending the addiction is the ultimate goal but they may not have the tools because they may still have inside them whatever made them start doing drugs in the first place and of course for food you have to still keep eating daily which makes it an even more nuanced problem than drug or alcohol addictions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are people such dicks they arent people theyre redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,suburban isolation mutates white guys into bigoted assholes afraid of their own shadow i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i picture the people saying that about poor people being like theyre going to pull themselves up by their bootstraps any day now for centuries
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats because ive seen people read shitposters compare fat acceptance to cancer acceptance or fat pride to cancer pride
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah very spot on there its like telling a drug addict well um just stop decriminalize drugs we shouldnt be punishing people who are victims of their addictions fuck you fat people you are the worst reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all the heads of all the nails also bingo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,punishing white kids with some weed and ecstasy and cocaine and shrooms who were just exploring their entrepreneurial spirit and creative side before settling down into voting republican and threatening to drive over protestors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all the heads of all the nails explain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just the euphemism you hit the nail on the head i just thought you were spot on with what you said
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oooooh yeah pretty much to elaborate the plainly artificial essence of most suburban environments creates an unseen miasma of unease and twilight zoneish thingsarenotright that makes people paradoxically more afraid despite being in the safest places on the planet a lack of things to be afraid of or concerned about doesnt make people feel safer instead leaving them to fill in the blank space of their concerns with whatever its the writing trick h p lovecraft used to make his cosmic horrors terrifying in that he makes the fearful things blank so that people can project their fears onto that blankness theres been a sharp uptick in racial fearmongering since the dawn of the new millennium so this is why i think anyways a lot of isolated people are becoming racist jacknozzles because their empty fearholes are being plugged with racebaiting nonsense by reactionary bad actors the dormant lizardbrain stuff modernfolk are supposed to have outgrown is primed for being tapped into by being isolated and surrounded by artifice and then is seized by raciallycharged rhetoric of retrograde snakeoil salesmen trying to sell these people the cure to a disease theyve been tricked into thinking they have
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a more optimistic interpretation might be that since the dawn of the new millenium or id probably wager since a little before a lot of people have started to acutally give a shit about race or theyve become more open about it with the explosion of social media on the internet and because of that people in suburban environments who as you noted basically have had never had to deal with anything hard in life are now feeling threatened by the fact that maybe floating through life while your fellow man is being oppressed might not be such an okay thing to do any more or even they literally have no concept of oppression so the fact that people are whining about it makes them think of those people as weaker because if these suburban white dudes started complaining about being oppressed it would be and is ridiculous they cant begin to appreciate everything thats been handed to them for free because theyve never had to actually think about it i think the thing that turns them into racist jacknozzles is that they were jacknozzles all along and in a time of peace it wouldnt have mattered the fact that theyre now being punched full frontal in the face with the idea that their own cushy lives come at the expense of other peoples is causing them to react theyre literally reactionaries i believe the term means something a little different from that politically or whatever but its a nice pun so ill keep it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when your reaction to a random made up story about a stranger is oh how i miss a place specifically dedicated to just shitting down on people who already get shit on a place full of non stop hate with zero redeeming qualities or positive contributions to anything you really need to turn around and take a fucking look at your wasted shell of a life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,up to now the entire thread is full of shit like that makes me wish i had res on my work computer so i could tag all of them and justknow who the shittier people on this site are also upvoted gals uhoh we misfired the brigade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont act like a couple extremists represent the whole sub this is always their goto argument lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is why i miss fph at utc harveyyevrah replied to this is why i miss fph httpiimgurcomzafsvoopng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but but muh motivation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that thread is depressing the hell out of me even in that photo you can see how defeated that woman is op says he was coughing and sneezing on her im sure him and his girlfriend were making fun of her the whole time too and i doubt op was polite at any point if hes the type of person to take that photo and post to reddit to bully her it was probably that passengers nightmare come true that some asshole would try to humiliate her on a flight thats cramped enough as it is but her friends assure her no one is that mean and itll be okay but she had the misfortune of being seated next to a redditor i commented on that thread saying if she had bought an extra seat people would complain shes overweight and selfish and taking away a seat from someone else who might have needed it i got a reply saying overweight people are the worst and its all her fault and shes a drain on societyand of course they had to point out they find it unattractive like they have any knowledge of her life and her journey that maybe she is working on losing weight or maybe shes already down and that was her first time flying since and she felt fantastic rant that thread just really got me and now its the top post on reddit and someone paid real money to pat op on the back for harassing some poor lady brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,upvoted gals it was at earlier
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,likei get it rude people suck but op was most likely much much ruder reddit is way too obsessed with revenge fantasies to realize that no revenge really isnt the best thing in the world sure it can feel good at the time but it certainly isnt the right thing to do and im not saying that i act in ways that are good all the time but there are better ways to handle situations like this someone asked op what he wouldve done if it was a huge body builder and op said he wouldve done nothing i feel like this says all we need to know about this man whether hes okay with punching down or if he just really hates fat people i bet he was a fpher back in the day theres also an extra slice of triggered jokes made by him in the thread too so that really shows us who hes dealing with i hate shit like this so much why is it so hard to be decent to one another if you show any empathy youre weak and must also be fat or whoever reddits hating on in the thread empathy and being decent is seen as a weakness here and thats really what tires me out about reddit redditors really are gullible theyre the first to say wake up sheeple but then theyre believing the first thing someone tells them if it fits inline with their prejudices i honestly dont like to call rthathappened but there are shreds of doubt in me about this story for all we know the woman apologized for not being able to move much more the flight was full maybe so there wasnt anywhere else for this woman to go and op sneezed and coughed on her terrorizing her with his wife and took a picture of her to further the bullying on reddit this woman has a life and reddits front page is so big now that this man couldve potentially ruined it sure rmildlyinfuriating isnt thaaaat big of a sub but its big enough remember that story about that man who took a friends cardboard cutout on a bachelor party because his horrible fiancee wouldnt let him out and then it came out that he didnt want to go all along and that he had two children to take care of its just like that so yeah im with you the thread really got to me and it really does show that reddit lacks empathy and decency and im sick of it i really am
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah there are people who probably have downvote scripts on this sub i dont have any proof though heh but i bet there are people who are salty enough to do it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just experienced something like this on the train the other day everyone is getting off work so its packed i usually take the first aisle seat by the door because i get off at the first stop and i sit down because standing on a crowded train makes me anxious as fuck but if someone wants to take the inside seat i get up for them and a larger woman comes on and asked the kids across the aisle from me if she could sit next to them and they laughed at her they fucking laughed at her and said no she was visibly distressed but everyone just ignored her she was looking around for an empty seat so i got up to let her in my row but she was really hesitant and kept apologising for taking up too much space this is a lady just trying to get home from work like everyone else she paid for her ticket just like everyone else and it breaks my heart to think this is probably something shes very used to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just dont understand it why do people have to be the worst they can be what do they get out of it they dont know this woman she might be disabled or just tired and needs a place to sit as a rule unless ive been walking around all day andor my knee is acting up i usually give my seat up to anyone who looks like they could use it despite the knee decreased cartilage im fairly spry so i can stand and id always give my seat up if someone asked for it i just dont understand it why not strive to be the best you can be and maybe make someones day a lot easier im not asking for sainthood or anything like that im certainly not one but i give up my seat for someone who needs it and i treat people like well people people with their own struggles and backstories and lives who need kindness just as i need it sometimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit could watch a picture of a rock sitting on the ground and still come to the conclusion that they are in fact oppressed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they dont even care about men being sexualized they dont necessarily want it to stop they just look at this and are like i want to do that to women thats the type of equality they want equality where you can be shitty to anyone as long as it happens to marginalized people of the time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if the roles were reversed so if a woman would allow two men to touch her and she would be okay with that the dude looks like he at worst mildly annoyed she would be most probably be called a slut or a whore or a degenerate or basically a porn star by the same redditors who now claim misandry i remember a thread about this artist whos name i just cant remember had thise performance art piece where she allowed people to touch her breasts and vagina redditors where either calling is just porn or proof a degenerate women are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when these guys pretend that reddit isnt their safe space from the real tangible world where normal people would take offense to their gross behavior and jokes its almost funny but then i just get sad exactly the people who end up spending all their time on reddit are the ones who have issues socially and come online to avoid all the negative attention and confrontation they encounter in real life instead of consolidating around that they decide to use their real life experience to dish it out to people they consider easy targets the insecurity levels on this site warrant scientific research
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what makes me most sick about this as that they are coming to the conclusion that you should literally be able to sexually harass or assault women because this guy is consenting to women touching his muscles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if it were the reverse arguments make no sense its not its not like that the ideologies the history and the societal differences are too great its never going to be a valid argument you cant just flip it around as if both sides started out exactly the same
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all of those words all of those fucking words goddamn and not a single fucking bit of sense among them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least nbc got called out on its shit this was mild compared to the sexism that got sprinkled during the olympic coverage but this scene was just so fucking unnecessary ugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a legitimate issue lost in redditeur ignorance and self victimizing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre not allowed to be racist or rape or fuck children anymore of course theyre going to conclude theyre oppressed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this point reddit could look at someone else being oppressed and come up with a reason why calling out the oppression oppresses them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we already have that equality this is exactly it though they cant actually conceive of not enjoying being groped or of feeling threatened or objectified so instead of saying lets not grope people they say lets grope everyone they simply cannot understand how being objectified every day of life from birth makes you feel or of feeling vulnerable in these situations if a guy is getting groped by a woman chances are hes still in a power position the same cannot be said of a woman you cant just reverse it and say its the same thats not how it works thats how we get bullshit stuff like the supposed racism against whites in north america
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think thats what theyre saying i think what they mean is that if a woman consented two men to oil her down they the men would look like creeps and wouldnt be getting cheered on by a crowd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they brought oil and asked if they could rub it on him it was definitely planned lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can i lock in for both answers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt that their response to all race related issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,from this dudebros comment history i wanted to post this to srs but this didnt get upvoted and it would probably get removed and i would get shadowbanned too and that subreddit is basically cancer delusional single women mostly hey shitstain you dont gotta be here if all the single ladies are too intimidating for you you can go crawl back into the portapotty from whence you came
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there was something recent it was posted to rvideos a few times a woman walked around the streets inviting people to touch her
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,na far mor recent i think a german artist with a mirrored box around her sexy bits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i didnt mean all of them are saying that quite a few are and quite a few are saying what you said too its weird in our society because we make it that way they will wonder why that is but every time a womans naked body is seen they make it about sex or their penis idiots
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you for being rational
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do i a white guy need to inform my wife that i am now a delusional single woman because i like to party here is there a secret handshake or something similar that i should know about i mean ive already castrated myself and regularly sacrifice male infants to the glorious snake goddess cuckoldera while my wife aggressively pegs me and reads aloud from andrea dworkin what else do i need to do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah yes the old single ladies tend to be more delusional argument because a womans sanity is dependent on whether she is single or not what a shitstain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well alright your usage of they seemed to be painting with a pretty broad brush but its good you clarified what you meant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol that image though lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah that sounds right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they as all the redditbros in the thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey there this is not the right place for this kind of post i apologize please read the sidebar
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh ok sorry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are a lot of truly creepy fucks on reddit when you encounter them in real life theyre probably the people who send shivers down your spine but you cant quite put your finger on why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i found a lost kid once my rule of thumb is finders keepers at utc shitnmuhgrits replied to i found a lost kid once my rule of thumb is finders keepers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cant wait to see this winners mugshot in the news
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kidnapping
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is there such a thing as a noncreep white boy the study would probably be a waste of time but eh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,excessive force is alright but wanting kids tsk tsk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,save up sick days just because youre pregnant what if she was sick before she needed to take the leave another top notch idea from the patriarchy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is a big babby crying about how european welfare capitalism is somehow socialism and calling all of europe a continent of leeches this are the fuckers who think theyre logical and rational
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a sub for womens issues lol is there anything on reddit that isnt ruined by alt right white men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do they really not understand why its a problem when a cop who shoots an unarmed black person basically gets a vacation but a cop whos pregnant is forced out of her position without pay like i understand that you cant be chasing after people when youre months along but theres no reason she cant do desk work until she has the baby
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes we are forced to cover the costs of your socialist programs with our military maybe if you guys werent a continent of leeches we would have more luxuries here at home rshitamericanssay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like they dont think women should be cops or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah okay bozo sure it was her choice that the good ole boys club decided that the human gestation period and everything remotely associated with it ie child care are burdens fundamentally incompatible with a career also in before wait but men suffer from the lack of paternity leave what about the mens
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ready for down votes just drop it redditors nobody likes a victim complex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on a police officer that had to take unpaid leave after getting pregnant it was her body her choice ready for down votes at utc replied to it was her body her choice ready for down votes httpiimgurcomqqsyupnpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how the hell does that get upvoted on a subreddit thats supposedly for women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you could make the argument that some welfare systems in europe are based off resources stolen from asia africa and the americas however i dont think that was what the big babby was going for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my pasta
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they dont think women should be anything but sleeping with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not for women its for men to shout down women for having a different opinion to them about the things that directly affect women it was moderately better before they became a default
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so what your saying is that she needs to shoot an unarmed black man s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well the least you could do is share the recipe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrshitredditsayswikivorpalpasta
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly it seems pretty bizarre that they cant just put her on desk duty you think her coworkers and boss would be happy and excited for her stories like this make me lose faith in humanity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tasty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i finally got a chance to see rogue one today and i really enjoyed it i really appreciated how it seemed to lampoon the mindset of im above politics both sides are dumb and having convictions is for losers that seems ever popular on reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is anyone else getting a bit burned out trying to avoid bigotry everywhere on reddit even smaller subs and very specific subs are becoming more bigoted it used to be easier to avoid the defaults and the racist subs but the bigotry has seeped into alot more subs its really annoying what do we think the future of reddit is will it just become another racist website or will the admins etc finally get some courage and purge the bigotry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,finally going home to new york for new years unrelated note ive started bingewatching on old cn shows currently on a knd marathon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so yeah serena williams got engaged to a reddit admin this is a thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember everybody political correctness is cancer but saying that someone is racist is just too mean and disrespectful

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i completely failed creating a xubuntu live usb thing it broke halfway through because there was no config file and now i cant fix my usb it seems to know it exists for example on my device manager thing it shows unknown device although it has pretty much no info not even capacity theres some stuff about device drivers though it doesnt appear with diskpart or on disk management and certainly not windows explorer some kind of code error ill try stuff tomorrow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh god i gotta make time to watch thatwell i will for carrie fisher but yeahthat mentality is shallowi mean i can understand not being fond of either side and distancing but these guys think they are in the right for being on neither sidewhen in reality most people i know who claim to be on neither side lean more towards the right defending conservatives and bashing liberals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,happy birthday
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,happy birthday d
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sadly i was in high school when knd started airing so i was too old to get invested in it but seeing some of it now i cant deny that it had a charm of its own

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is he a dramaloving admin or a freeze peachloving admin i need to if im happy about this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,should be played during trumps inauguration
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember everyone that politically correct jokes are freedom of speech but making jokes towards white people and heterosexual people is wrong and should not be done also apparently trump won because people were being nice to white people but maybe if white people treated poc the way they wanted to be treated poc would stop calling them racists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you need help let me know i do this kind of shit all the time youre going to need to reformat your usb and then id recommend using a live usb creator using something like httpsrufusakeoie i think rufus also takes care of formatting the drive for you best of luck and welcome to linux its an awesome world

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one is stopping him from making the white nationalist dating community he so desperately wants
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would also like to add that a student at my university recently had screenshots posted where he harassed black women on tinder calling them monkeys of a person telling them they will always be the property of white people and saying that he sleeps better at night because he is not our social justice coalition and antiracism coalition posted the screenshots on their page which they were originally posted by the woman he was harassing and the organization posted a letter to the administration letting them know that their response to racist situations has been lax basically if we dont talk about racist situations publicly they wont happen has been the administrations attitude and has created an environment for students like this one harassing this woman on tinder the posts with the screenshots were removed from their pages because they were deemed harassment of that student maybe black people would like a dating site where they dont get degraded and if you try to call out their abusers it is dismissed for being harassment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know what eats centipedes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate lab courses so very much

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit still believes quantityeffort validity i tried explaining i didnt want to spend an hour searching through journal at my uni library to find an article and got called wrong because the other person who had no source not even a wiki wrote more than i did im sorry but im not your fucking librarian i have a damn life outside of reddit so im not about to spend my day researching shit for reddit comment to some loser
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh boy now all the rnews and rthedonald posters are invading rosu and rcolumbus to jerk off about how the somalians in columbus need to be deported because of one crazy asshole these people have no relation at all to my university or the city of columbus hell half of them dont even have any posts that show they have any connection to ohio and are trying to use this tragedy to divide us

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a would let it fuck me up again its one of the few storyfocused games i actually played through twice and i started a third playthrough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i will never be over that game thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes enjoyed very much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its donnie darko meets a blue is the warmest color very good game
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit still believes quantityeffort validity i tried explaining i didnt want to spend an hour searching through journal at my uni library to find an article and got called wrong because the other person who had no source not even a wiki wrote more than i did there was some study showing that the dynamic on internet forums including reddit is highquality posts tend to get no more attention than middling posts lowquality posts attract attention which tends to be more lowquality posts and encourages the author to post more the only way to win is not to play
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,much better quality that brd isnt taking any shit from any centipede
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just like they only care about freeze peaches when a bigot or someone they agree with is speaking but when its someone disadvantaged they cease giving a fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well he said it under his breath i dont think he meant for me to hear him but still a shitty response
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive played it twice now and watched countless peoples lets plays but im trying to watch less so i can replay it again before the years up seriously one of the best games ive played in a long time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i played it over the summer for the first time and im still obsessed with it spent hours last night reading fanfic when i should have been sleeping idk what about it exactly is so powerful but this game has been a serious force of nature in my life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bigot or someone they agree with i think you just made a distinction without a difference boyo

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but earthlier happy is le meme unforced nbsp than that which withering within the lonely redditor nbsp grows lives and dies in mangry solitude nbsp to post or not to post that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of oh fuck this shit nbsp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,web comics are shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,too few propellers this comic pretty much denies the existence of attack helicopters at utc replied to too few propellers this comic pretty much denies the existence of attack helicopters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors sure have active imaginations
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and now everyone who already thinks this happens is like aha i knew it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so this is the new helicopter meme huh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but earthlier happy is le meme unforced nbsp than that which withering within the lonely redditor nbsp grows lives and dies in angry solitude nbsp respect is earned where has this redditor ever earned any forced memes are all it takes to get respect around here unfortunately nbsp worthwhile people dont become redditors like him this brand of posting is born out of being unwanted by society that is why they cling to it so hard they have nothing else what a curious thing redditor humor one might as well speak of compassionate conservatism or white humanity for all the sense these words make together reddit humor could be replaced by dangled keys and shouted slurs and theyd enjoy it all the same
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seems like were brigading ourselves again

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this time without that petty mask of otherkin hatejust pure transphobia fuck brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats how redditors work they see something that they think to be funny then they reuse it for the rest of their lives thinking that others find it funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its now at like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hello please allow me to use gendered slurs while telling you how you should feel
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trying to take girlfriend to a strip club okay i dont think strip clubs are really a good thing but i guess if she wants to calling a woman a bitch for not entertaining your every whim oh for fucks sake reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if he wants to see firemen and officers strip to their banana hammocks he should just go by himself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if i dont enjoy or like strip clubs and they make me uncomfortable does that automatically make me an uptight bslur edit to the person accusing me of being a swerf how does me not enjoying or consuming sex work imply that i dont support sex workers right to do what they do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my ex boyfriend used to act this way the second you didnt want to do something fun you were obviously an uptight bslur who couldnt let loose its super manipulative and i see it all the goddamn time from redditeurs ugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,strip clubs make me uncomfortable im not against them if a woman wants to strip thats her prerogative but being uncomfortable in one is my deal and someone who thinks that makes me uptight can go fuck himself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no the gathering place of uptight bitches is on to you tbh you need to be a real grand asshole to call someone a uptight bitch because she doesnt care about your every whim other people have their life too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as if a redditor would ever go to a male strip club at the risk of their heterosexuality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder how many of these redditors would be comfortable going with their girlfriends to a male strip club and watching more muscular scantly clad and attractive men grind all over their girlfriends maybe it would make them a little uptight too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how is this a good idea are men these days are that stupid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,taking your girlfriend to a strip club can be fun if shes not an uptight bitch in reply to on why the hell are you with your boyfriend at a strip club my gf told me one of her exes took her to one dont know if ill ever understand this at utc dirkforthree wrote it can be fun if your girlfriend isnt an uptight bitch
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just because a girl isnt into polyamory doesnt mean shes uptight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,apparently it does you know like how not responding to street harassment does
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes because you dare have opinions thoughts or desires that do not align with while being subservient to le good guy redditsir
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol you thought being my girlfriend meant i cared about how you felt stop being uptight and do what i want you to do which at this moment is to watch me ogle other women like they are pieces of meat and if you act jealous or protest you arent fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the worse part is the fact that this guy thinks he can give relationship advice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh yeah its super gross how they normalise manipulative behavior
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were such a good brigade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not even polyamory its a particular form of erotic entertainment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not what polyamory is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you cant spell manipulate without man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,particularly something this unhealthy to a relationship if both parties arent on board with it if both are it can indeed be fun if your significant other isnt into something you are sexual or otherwise find a compromise or realise they arent a good match dont emotionally guilt or manipulate them into doing something against their will
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are several subreddits specifically devoted to this its gross as hell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cannot understand why you were downvoted for essentially saying the red pill and a number of others are fucking shitty places
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,polyamory is about romantic relationships going to a strip club doesnt mean youre in a relationship with the employees there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the relationship is tenuous at best i think youre confusing polyamory with general nonmonogamy polyamory is specifically about romantic relationships whereas nonmonogamy just means youre not sexually exclusive to your romantic partner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everything on this sub is downvoted presumably by hardworking srsters boning up on their brigading
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for the correction you know for as hard as many straight white people say it is to accept it when people correct you this is fuckin easy like its barely even effort how lazy and whiny are my fellow straight white males
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think youre confusing polyamory with general nonmonogamy i think i am too im kind of new to a lot of this stuff oh yeah even though ive been corrected on this other subject before while im here is it correct to refer to trans people as transgender or transgendered im having trouble recalling the other correction
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its transgender its an adjective a transgender man not a noun a transgender or a verb he transgendered a transgendered man when in doubt trans is pretty much always a suitable substitute for transgender afaik
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks uh person i cant tell where on the gender spectrum you fall through your username so im not assuming anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats okay i cant tell either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a straight slightly out of shape but not morbidly so white man with a beard on his neck who lives with his parents and lives off of ssi money thanks to a professionally diagnosed condition of high functioning autism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if the child consents tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reminds me of those slavery apologists if it werent for slavery those black people will still be savages in africa and outlawing it would be the greater evil probably some straight white middle class guy giving his unpopular opinion about something that doesnt affect him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,outlawing capitalism would be the greater good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,outlawing it would be the greater evil capitalism not even once
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just your average opinionated firstworld redditor who doesnt have the slightest idea about how life is like for us people of the third world we arent more than labour in their eyes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh fuck right off with this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did this fucker just say that childhood is a very recent concept
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was going to sarcastically say that we should be ok with child sex tourism since a lot of kids would starve to death and therefore the money itd provide them would be the lesser evil but then i remembered this is reddit and a lot of people wouldve agreed with it unironically ffs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors failing to understand there is a fucking difference between culturessocieties where children are involved in their parents professions and children who are literally fucking abused and exploited
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pure ideology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,child labor bunch a fuckin wussies ledditeur sitting in his chair comfy on his infinite information machine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yay capitalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its too much effort to come up with solutions to problems that dont impact me personally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is why we need srs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who will build the future if we dont overwork our children into dumb uneducated future fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is something these countries will have to figure out for themselves over the generations the same as we did i dont even know what to say
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hoo boy thats some spicy liberalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,invisible fucking ineffectual hand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder how many sweatshops this person has worked in to have brought us such valuable insight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so many smart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,child labor necessity of life bruh they just have to accept what white supremacist imperialist countries did to them for our benefit and pull themselves up by their bootstraps reparations how dare you hold me responsible for what somebody else did for my benefit youre the real racists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if a dog speaks what if a fish plays the piano what if a redditor understands consent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yknow its just biology corporations are supposed to be attracted to children once theyve developed hands and feet and dont tell me all of those kids dont want it lots of those kids are fully developed employable beings shit i heard of this kid who used to wear employable clothes and try to lure mature corporations into hiring them just so they could report the company it happens all the time its just nature
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,slavery apologists i owe trump a great debt in reminding me there are many people out there like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had someone tell me this minutes ago that the genocide and slavery doesnt matter because they get to live in a western country today
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriouslyjust this i mean if you outlaw child labor without providing kids with adequate support then kids are definitely going to suffer but the remedy to that is simply providing adequate support to kids not legalizing child labor ffs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the top comment response is just as fucked when i was in cambodia i went to an area where all the children spent half the day in school and half working and would share jobs with siblings doing half a day each this seemed like a really good solution
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is your brain on libertarianism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre gazing into the abyss of pure ideology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lots of people misunderstand coming of age rituals like bar mitzvahs and think that back in the day you were an adult at thats just silly and even today we have lots of differences both legally and socially in how we treat people at different ages yes there are cutoffs like and yes children used to be a lot more included in their parents work but no childhood is not a modern hippie invention
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im actually gonna save this comment lol its good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure we benefited from an international community and exploiting weaker nations but these folks have to do it all by themselves the most annoying part of these rambles is the poisonous assumption that every country should and must become like the states if it wants to be worthy of respect its one of the biggest things killing this planet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wed like you to use forced labour and abuse children so westerners can buy their shitty shoes oh you dont want to well thats a problem for you to sort out whilst we fund and encourage businessmen in your country to keep doing it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its sad that social imagination towards a better world is so numbed and defeated that human beings can no longer imagine an alternative to brothel or sweatshop its a testament to how profoundly capitalist ideology destroyed and crushed ideological resistance we can no longer see anything greater than meek reform and cynicism masked as altruism fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when i was a kid i would have loved to have a full time job do you know how badly kids want to work and earn money to buy stuff they want now were going to punish corporations for letting kids do something they want
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fwiw the people ive asked about it so my close friends and i all agree that we got the better end of the stick being in a western country than being born in india my country is a shit hole but by comparison im probably a lot more well off than i would be if my ancestors werent uprooted as a replacement for emancipated slaves it sucked for them but its better for me is how i look at it not saying that the fact that slavery and whatnot dont matter but at a strictly individual level i think it was a good thing for me also i know this comment is a week old but im replying because this is something ive put a fair amount of thought into over the years before coming to this conclusion in the education system where im from we have multiple years of mandatory exposure to caribbean history including a detailed look at the inner workings of slavery so its not like im unfamiliar with what it entailed either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id say outlaw child labour after youve established an international welfare system that will provide for them not before but maybe im just a heartless grinch
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cheap microwaves affordable healthcare
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,silly peasants dont you know feudalism made your pitchforks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so did fire whats your eta on the point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpiimgurcomgocyhvupng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is your brain on right libertarianism libertarian socialism is awesome
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is just your brain on capitalism libertarianism is like bathsalts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,libertarianism capitalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,image of vomit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sniff
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i honestly cant even see where anyone would get the idea that childhood was recently invented
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he consented with his eyes that kid looked like he wanted to be exploited by the bourgeoisie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait is socialism not even free healtcare anymore now its affordable healthcare oh shit boy that one zizek comic is coming true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or you could build an economic model which does not force women into choosing between having their labor exploited in a sweat shop or in a brothel hows that for a fucking idea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a shame reactionary filth perverted that once honorable word
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even though what op said is wrong and fucked up it is true that childhood as its known today in most western countries is a relatively recent concept however it varies throughout many different cultures and time periods its pretty complicated honestly i had an entire course on just the concept of childhood and i didnt learn all there was to know on the subject
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one that i know of is the invention of adolescence if you search for it on google you will get a bunch of articles i read one a few years ago and one thing that i did take away from it is that sheltering children from all adult responsibilities or from normal contact with adults might not be good for them but really the idea of child labor as an abstract concept is pretty twisted here my father used to have to do work on the farm when he was quite young one might call it child labor but it really isnt my mother used to work hours a week in a bakery when she was which is also vaguely harmless what actually happens in bangladesh and so on is that the working conditions are inhumane dont offer any real opportunities to get anywhere in life and interfere with education and development in that context of hard factory or sweatshop work child labor is completely sick and should be eliminated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait is socialism not even free healtcare anymore now its affordable healthcare i can almost hear marx raging in the grave
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its particularly bad when its out of the selfish greed of multinationals in order to make things cheaper for the privileged i think some of the kind of work done by family farmhandscottage industry is still a little problematic but its not a practice that will ever go away at least not any time soon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that thing has been on a steady spin since
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shit its spinning so fast that ferrari is considering using it as an engine in the season
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,noodle is a good racer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry i dont get it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,noodle from gorillaz did a jaguar commercial recently part of the lead up to the bands resurgence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone in a discord chat posted ill take user has no knowledge of how rape culture forces rape survivors into silence for edit ill take user above me thinks we have a rape culture when even a totally baseless accusation of rape can totally ruin the entire rest of a mans life and we have many people saying we should just listen and believe when women make accusations of rape and that all men are potential rapists for some dude replied he also claimed that he is proequality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember that guy who blamed millennial for kinkshaming his age difference fetish i sexually identify as a used carsalesman ever since i was a little boy i dreamed of ripping people off by selling them cars that went hundreds of miles while presenting them as barely used people say i can do that without it being a sexual identity and to make it as such is insane but i dont care im having a plastic surgeon graft a tacky suit to my skin for now on i want you to call me auto dealer and respect my right to charge for a car that costs if you cant accept me youre a dealerphobe and need to check your customer privilege thank you for being so understandingnow how would you like to check out this ford pinto he can go shove a hot poker down his urethra
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive been on this shithole of a website for an entire year its been fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just popped into the daily chat thread to share this resource for anyone running into people claiming muslims fail to condemn terror attacks muslimscondemncom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so i was researching a topic for my writingi decided to research pregnancy but the first image i see is a fetus as i take my first bite of dinnerinstaregret i thought i was over my tokophobiabut i wish i did considering that even though i live in california the people seem to have an obsession with birthing babies like its nobodys business and years ago everyone and his mother tried to fix me including an ex boyfriend who harassed me with pictures of someone elses baby i just cant do it againwhy is tokophobia such an alien concept in california of all places
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really want to be able to like racademicbiblical it has some great people on the mod team like koine but it also has total blowhard dips like brojangles which really undermines the subreddit edit lol hes being a total dipshit elsewhere rn and saying that conceptual things dont exist and that saying conceptual things exist is like saying water is dry and this interaction happened ballersmartperson top kek notballerbrojangles i dont know what any of this means im old ballersmartperson well since conceptual things dont exist its going to be pretty hard for you to grasp fucking ethered hahaha
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well on another note i finally watched the salesman as requirement for a classthat was a sad ending and i didnt know children in iran knew who spongebob is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can totally ruin yeah can is it likely fucking look around look at fucking trump its incredibly rare in comparison to rape and sexual assault not to mention also totally illegal but mras arent going to let that stop them from silencing rape victims in general oh no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lots of rape victims for one reason or another dont report their abuser is it really surprising that seeing someone who raped you run for president might galvanize you into reporting them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,never mind slowly changing attitudes towards sexual assault from the time of the assault fear of a billionaires lawyers and connections or the sudden realisation that hes about to potentially become the leader of your nation leaving you feeling a moral duty to speak out nah they kept quiet because its all fake arseholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,professionalism i mean arahaa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a dream job
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,give em hell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hundreds of miles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even the dangerously explosive ford pinto doesnt deserve to be brought into this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hit years on my old account i dont feel good about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i tend to check td conservative and libertarian to see what theyre up to and its usually just really weird i dont understand them at all its like they all live in constant fear of made up threats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not hatesubs but i do hateread rdebatereligion and rchristianity actually rchristianity is hatesublite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember reactionaries only like statistics when they go in their favor otherwise its feels realz and look at all the men who get ruined by rape accusation its not about whether something is a problem or not its about fighting the biggest problem and that is rape ps if you look at countries where male entitlement is more pronounced manonwoman rape is almost commonplace though i bet if you bring that up all youll get in response is islamophobia im pretty sure discrimination is dead in the united states jontron
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its been at least years for me holy shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they will silence your voice with their political correctness forever unless you vote for our godemperor sad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if something like thedonald and pypass are hatesubs then yes lite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as an alaska native yes christianity is still a hatesub and the less said about rtruechristian the better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do these people ever consider that maybe fighting for the right to fuck teenagers is not a worthwhile cause
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even if we accepted your hairsplitting as you try to cast ephebophilia as distinct from pedophilia rather than a subset of it the same problems of consent and the abuse of power dynamics come into play and its still gross and still abuse so quit trying to draw your false distinction as if it matters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh ephebeebeeepophilia eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sweden is a pretty damn good country thats why i asked because i liked the law and wanted to make sure it was from somewhere i liked in reference to a law allowing adults to have sex with year olds the smile at the end makes it extra creepy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stop defending young people being preyed upon you creepy motherfuckers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was in that thread i got a shitton of downvotes and corrections for having the audacity to think pedophilia was bad whats next peaceful muslims and hardworking africanamericans ridiculous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins gamers are dead redditors have become their racist old uncles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i want to have sex with teenagers not children
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao does follow every single link posted on here to give his two cents what a sad sad man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they really want to find some kind of loophole so people wont call them a pedo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,illegal depending on where you are where i live its perfectly legal for year olds to have sex with anyone over ya but i feel like you arent saying this because you were born in a place with the age of consent at and thats just your norm i feel like you moved to a place where the age of consent was because you are an ephebohphiliac
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aaaaaaaaaaaand fuck all of that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but my dick it is not like i care that year old girls dont want to be hit on by year old men my dick wants what it wants
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pedophilia only applies to pre pubescent children so fucking a year old no matter how old you are wouldnt make you a pedophile in reply to epicblob on yeah but theres a line somewhere if youre or so but you fucked a year old thats pedophilia if youre and fuck a year old it isnt both times you and the other person are underage but its still pedophilia if theyre prepubescent at utc arebokert wrote pedophilia only applies to pre pubescent children so fucking a year old no matter how old you are wouldnt make you a pedophile
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,another manchild with a victim complex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,law of pedophilia that is all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reactionaries are amazing at dragging people into arguing about wordplay rather than the real issue at hand the biggest examples beingb race realists and im not racist because i hate islam theyll jerk themselves raw over semantics and dictionary definitions while ignoring the whole bigotry situation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man i wouldnt even give it that much acknowledgement the simple fact is that this person is working his damnedest to justify his attraction to year old girls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats all folks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i always read it as having the fe fi fo fanna song in it so something like ephebibannananophannafefifofannaphile i want to have sex with children
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh now sweden is a good country when its about immigration or left leaning policies its all cuck cuck cuck cuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey muhammad was a pedophile therefore fuck islam but also aint nothin wrong with pedophilia taa daaa reddit is magic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors think this is really important for some reason even if we were to imagine for a moment that every little niggle and nitpick was right or that every distinction was meaningful it would still be weird how much effort they put into this this shit clearly matters to them which is more than a little troubling the only way i can comfort myself is to imagine that most of these people defending it are really young themselves maybe it isnt much comfort but speaking as a year old dude who thinks is also pretty young and immature its a lot less concerning to imagine this stuff coming from a nervous year old with whacked out priorities than from a year old spending his precious internet time trying to rationalize creeping on his daughters friends
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thread is a mess you dont need to look far to see someone called whytelivesmatter telling people to educate themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this keeps getting better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey uredditisdisgusting reddit sure is fucking disgusting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre a kind person to call him a man someday maybe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youd let them take their balls home youre generous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is exactly it they play the well its not technically so therefore its not bad while flatly ignoring what theyre actually doingin ops case having sex with a minor or in your example hating an entire class of people its a really cheap way to pull the blanket over your head and say im not listening lalala
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how is disliking a bunch of ideas islam bigotry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get that hence the whole im an ephophile school of pedophile apologetics ugh justugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this video ever not relevant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i knew what this was even without watching it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im bookmarking this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol i wanted to mention that but i didnt want to start shit off topic everythings ok unless nonwhites do it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,law in there pretty much saying this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hivemind fallacy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im and i dont think its weird if i like a year old however there are people trying to tell me year olds liking year olds isnt weird either i dont get why they have to justify it its fucking weird pedophilia ephophilia whatever you wanna call it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the one thing i cling onto that is making me think this place isnt just the asshole of hell is that reddit is populated by teenage boys and these opinions might make more sense to them if not fuck this place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because disliking entire ideals and judging everyone who follows said ideals over a few bad apples is bigotry in the most general sense hating islam because a few groups use it as a reason for violence against others when millions upon millions around the world follow islam and are completely peaceful is bigotry thats like hating all white men because the ones who shoot up churches schools and other white people are mostly men and white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ｆｕｃｋｉｎｇ ｄｉｓｇｕｓｔｉｎｇ ｐｅｏｐｌｅ when i was a bit younger i saw this stuff as innocent people trying to justify an innocent attraction to younger kids i thought pedophilia was expected of people who had no real romance growing up or were perhaps socially outcast however now that i can see it from the perspective of an adult i see it so differently those of us who are older have the responsibility to ensure that the young have a world in which they can grow up as children should why is it so fucking hard for these people to understand that its not about being a pedophile its what you do when you push sex onto kids who are still learning the bare basics about their own bodies politics and the world around them how difficult is that to understand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i posted it every time i thought it was relevant i would be posting it like sixteen times a day resisting the urge to post it every time takes herculean effort
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rape no she just changed her mind afterwards oh the perp wasnt white rape epidemic all the brown people need to go away
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what people usually try to argue is that there isnt some magical switch that gets flipped on your birthday that makes you a mentally mature adult so therefore we should all get to fuck year olds no one ever takes this reasoning the other way and suggests that maybe and year olds fucking year olds is pretty goddamn gross too thats what i think is strange about all of this to clarify i dont like to be ageist there are a lot of people on reddit who will mention their age like theyre pulling rank on you and i dont think that my age means i have little or nothing to learn from younger people but i also dont think people my age are on an even playing field with teenagers romantically and that nearly any such relationship would amount to exploitation if we all stopped trying to rationalize our peens and tried to act like reasonable and compassionate human beings thered be nothing left to discuss i think and yet the debate rages on on reddit dot com
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not to mention that many islamophobes generalize all middle eastern and south asian people as muslims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this incels raid tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ｆｕｃｋｉｎｇ ｄｉｓｇｕｓｔｉｎｇ ｐｅｏｐｌｅ ftfy

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah shiet nvm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hi rshitredditsays says downvoters or maybe youre just being downvoted for being an angry negative asshole on rupliftingnews
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i kind of agree with the op in that difficult presidential election is not how one spells descent into theocratic fascism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,blame blm million illegals its their fault for making me racist

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anything good for rsrsmailbag or just mangry whinging
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think you have us confused with a httpswwwredditcomrthedonald httpswwwredditcomrkotakuinaction sweetie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they also believe removing of people from the country would somehow aid the economy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nothing good so far hes being really boring
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and he just deleted his account apparently wtf was that about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,survive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,translation i am incapable of seeing women as anything other than sexual objects and also feel creepily possessive towards my sisters body
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i survive with my hot sister because i dont view her in a sexual nature ever because shes my sister this really isnt difficult at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae control their sisters sex life sorry random bro but can we compare dicks first for healthy male reasons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how the fuck does this shit have up votes who the fuck sexualizes their family members like not their cousins but their own sisters not like it should matter anyway to the extent that it would be difficult not to be sexually interested in them this is one of the worst things ive seen on reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sometimes i feel lucky that object does not activate my peen i dont know how you broshits that have peen activating object survived without incest
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in whites the cispeen not the brain is the seat of cognition whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins if you go to family reunions to meet women you might be a redneck redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sometimes i feel lucky my sister is ugly as dog shit i dont know how you brothers of hot sisters survive at utc analinferno replied to sometimes i feel lucky my sister is ugly as dog shit i dont know how you brothers of hot sisters survive httpiimgurcomkjbapqlpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if their penis isnt fed a sacrifice every night it starts to eat the host instead dont you know basic biology s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but what if your homebros tell you they think shes hot are you just going to take that man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dear whitey this doesnt mean you know how to think because youve established long ago you cant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it begins by eating the frontal cortex then slowly devours the rest of the brain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why the fuck would you be attracted to your own sister nvm youre a shitlord get out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,facts arent racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white people arent really people but a subhuman animallike species you cant be racist to animals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,racism requires being at the lower end of a societal power dynamic in the united states whites are anything but on racial axes of privilege
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,best explanation of reddit ive ever heard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but you said having to deal with it like its something you have to work to manage i think thats whats putting everyone off my sister is very beautiful but im not attracted to her this has not been difficult and ive never heard of it as something you have deal with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look up the sociological definition of racism were talking about racism in the academic sense not what dictionarycom tells us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the racial barriers have been in place long before the founding of the united states founded on racial slavery and genocide im sorry its taken you so long to find them also i must admit thats better than the usual dictionary definition of racism white people love posting the part youre missing is where white people are distinguished as superior from the outset and everything that follows in society is based on that assumption
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,swedes used to be on the low end of the racial totem pole in the us its astonishing just to what a degree racism has been and continues to be an integral part of that country
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah that would require interacting with white people gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white people are so good at discrimination that we even discriminate against other white people on the basis of race
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the best argument ive heard for eugenics was a voluntary sterilization tax break people need money if they get a vasectomy tax breaks that way its peoples choice and still sorta does the trick sterilize poor people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my standard rule regarding eugenicists well think about it so long as you go first
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its so fucking weird how even when reddit was in its libertarian phase it still supported shit like eugenics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man i dunno maybe we could just have decent rehabilitation for drug addiction rather than punishment seems like that would be a lot easier than sterilizing people is it that hard to not be a vindictive person or what
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sterilize redditeurs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no u
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no looks like were brigading ourselves again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this shit makes me absolutely sick these type of people should be sterilized in reply to recycledpaper on we see a lot of cocaine preggos in our practice they have complicated pregnancies and its by sheer dumb luck and mostly tax payer funded intensive care that we get a healthy ish baby do they shape up and get on birth control and become model moms who dote on their newborns no they come back pregnant with cocaine again and the other baby in foster care maddening at utc mrsarigold wrote this shit makes me absolutely sick these type of people should be sterilized httpiimgurcomgricxripng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know like if they think sterilization is so great why dont they go first its not like theyre saints although im sure in their own minds they are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but im sure some of these assholes dont want kids so be careful with that one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but but but then i wouldnt get the pleasure of feeling like a better person than they are s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,eugenicists pretty much always assume theyll be unaffected by their breeding programs and herd cullingsbut i guarantee if such a thing ever returns as public policy more redditeurs than not will be first on the list to get their plumbing forcibly cut
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we take their full tackle not just the gametemaking bits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this ones a bit iffy hes clearly mocking trump
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seeing stuff like this makes me disappointed that i own any of their games this is hardly the first disgusting thing ive seen from the community
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on a little hands supporter living out his fantasy in a video game by pretending to be donald trump invading mexico my goals are gonna be great best you can imagine we are going to make america great again in reply to kellenderheide on very nice read short sentences easy to understand what are your goals push south further than mexico conquer china one world under trump at utc nuclearwarlordgandhi wrote my goals are gonna be great best you can imagine we are going to make america great again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feet higher
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this shit happens all the time on that sub every other week its someone doing an aar as nazi germany or the csa hes a trump supporter now leave
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how is it funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you look at the imgur post its pretty clear its a joke though he starts by proclaiming hell pick his cabinet through a reality tv show
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its funny too in an actual gamer way germany and the us in that game are literally easy mode you can lazily conquer countries as germany no problem as their hero hitler was incredibly dumb its not even fun its just boring
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and little hands supporters do nothing but vomit memes all day the context is there hes a trump supporter white supremacists love these games because they can live out their fantasies dont be obtuse its a trump fantasy scenario plain and simple
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae womens only purpose in dressing themselves is to advertise sexual availability
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those little black chokers are actually black belts in sucking dick in reply to youdontknowwhatimean on girls wearing chokers it seems to be everywhere suddenly at utc wrote a user sorry i forgot who posted this the other day those little black chokers are actually black belts in sucking dick httpiimgurcomccparfgpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that actually makes me mad my year old sister wears these i dont want assholes making shitty jokes like that about her
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i should get a choker seems like a useful skill to have
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in whites the cispeen not the brain is the seat of cognition a reddit account is actually fifth dan in being a worthless asshole
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well somebody needs to crank it less like i wear black chokers the fuck is this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae the world revolves around mah peen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im and tons of girls at my hs wear these theyre literally just popular because theyre easy to put on and wear everyday also goth nostalgia and stuff anyway whoever made that post needs to disassociate porn with reality like real goddamn quick
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was about to say the same thing though my little sister is slightly older still just a kid though that joke is fucking gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,triplecattebenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh word
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how many of these things are there even
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors you mean way too many
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i meant the benning images tru tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where did we originally get these
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they were made by srsters if you want to make any submit them to rsrsfartsandcrafts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,happy diwali everyone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a top comment in raustralia is saying aboriginal people arent human straight up century bullshit being upvoted i got called unscientific when replying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hello hows everyones day been
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just saw that thread once again the faux progressives on raustralia show their true colours when talking about aboriginals if its not the lock outs or rants about the baby boomers raustralia has no interest in it edit changed not to no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dammit australia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow srs is the real brigade rite guys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the chat topics get hit hard unfortunately a lack of activity from legitimate posters here tends to make that even worse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,approved by brds ministry of communication reports are futile madbros behold your crumbling image and despair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,make reddit great again by shutting down rthedonald ok reddit was never really great but at least itll be less shitty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im gobsmacked the admins said their primary reason for not taking action was wed have to do some work ie handle the several thousand accounts who would be smearing feces all over reddit for several days after shutting down the sub well boo fucking hoo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,prayer hands emoji let it die
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,facebook google and twitter spent the days following the election at least tried to do some soulsearching reddit has been conspicuously silent in shouldering blame for giving an audience and a recruitment center to this groundswell of bigotry despite harboring its most prominent community—one which openly mocks the leadership and rules of the very platform that allowed it to proliferate reddit needs to contend with its own shrieking tide of ignorance and hatred now and outgrow the notion that fewer rules is the shortest distance to greater authenticity this is so true and in the kerfuffle they seem to have absconded with less of the blame too oh fake news on facebook perpetrated by russian spies lost hillary the election so did a bunch of babies on reddit who were actually legitimized by trump himself in that ama somehow this whole outcome seems the culmination of what reddits been doing the whole time or at least as long as ive been here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its long past time to abandon ship for imzy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yesssssssssssss burn thedonald down brdnom music time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hopefully for good this time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre tearing me apart lisa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good gooooooooooood we are so close to ending the virus named free speech forever yessssssssss
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god theyre pathetic can you imagine sitting around all day organizing vote brigades theyre so low energy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol wut people are reporting this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seems a bit switched
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uspez is obviously some sort of white supremacist himself why else would the quarantined subs be subsidized adfree
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a voat sitting in the harbor ready to set sail for any donald user that wants to pack up and leave
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think its cowardice they still have this noble idea about free speech look how long it took to ban rjailbait it got to he point where they would alternate shifts checking every post there all day long so that cp wasnt posted because there went enough mods then it reached the news and they were bringing in a new ceo so they banned it at that point they dont believe in curating their own website dont break some of their noble rules and ideas doxxing brigading free speech is important dont be doing things at the same heinous level as cp and they will let you go about your business
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they know exactly what to expect from fph coontown it cant be that hard to tighten the reigns for a few days until the assholes walk away
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its totally doable any tantrum of sufficient size to be a challenge can also easily be infiltrated and headed off active moderation just isnt their style
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,👏🏽praise be brb👏🏽 👏🏿let it die👏🏾
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im trying to like imzy but it suffers from over design i need clean simple easy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imzy is so the opposite of reddit recently i saw a leader of a huge community forced to step down because they made an antitrans joke not full on hate speech but a sort of attack helicopter type of reference its just night and day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this place heaven
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is there a way of signing up without giving an email address or phone number
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who should i follow on imzy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would use imzy more if it had more people more content and an easier to use design if i stick to just a few subreddits i generally wont have a bad time its usually coming here or going to rall when im exposed to all the horrendous things redditors say
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyy young blud
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that it could only come out of a bad adaptation of the producers that would actually explain a lot wouldnt it considering that startups in tech love to burn other peoples money it makes a lot of sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if staff admins were in regular communication with lenazi mods im pretty sure they are there have been references to this in comments before like spez talking to mods in td and things like the chat coming up them not getting banned despite being worse than ctfph would suggest that too i dont have a tinfoil hat on but i bet td removes just enough stuff so that spez can say they are not completely bad or something that would be such a monmumentally foolish decision and such a huge waste of their investors money theres a lot of money catering to the altright this is one of the biggest such communities on the internet they spam social media heavily im pretty sure spez doesnt mind all the traffic hes getting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that would be such a monumentally foolish decision which is perfectly in line with the choices of reddits leadership were not talking captains of industry with experience in successful companies spezs only meaningful work experience is founding reddit straight out of college gobbling up vc money to keep it afloat for the last decade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you forgot we mods take care of those issues evilevilevil
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,source on this first im hearing of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but what about srs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ministry o truth lies this is fact dear pupper
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its already spreading over everything shutting down fph caused a weeklong tantrum on the site tantrums are inevitable not a reason to avoid what needs to be done
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,itll probably be like fph first they get angry and shit all over the website which they do now anyway and after a few days theyll lose interest and redditll go down to its regular level of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there have been stories published which confirm the reddit top brass are sympathetic to sexist racist white supremacy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know they never leave a few go to voat for the hardcore shit the rest stay on reddit to whine and dogwhistle everywhere they go
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,noble idea and like reallyexisting nobility its ultimately about nothing more than will to power and one persons right to tell others how to be so of course they cater to dominant forces
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think its cowardice they still have this noble idea about free speech they dont believe in curating their own website and thats the big lie isnt it free speech is the dressed up marketing story for the real philosophy at the heart of this website algorithmically controlled content delivery and curation it was never about you having a platform to say whatever you want it was about there being no profitable way to police a uniform standard of content and conduct the algorithm will keep things rolling the real lesson of the donald is one that the rest of the social media companies are struggling with algorithms are stupid and easy to manipulate and people will manipulate them facebook is being dominated by fake news because of this the horrifying lesson for the reddit admins though and why theyre so loathe to act among other things is that any firm action against td would be an admission of failure of that core philosophy the problem of thedonald is foundational to reddit and cannot be fixed without a change in the philosophy that a machine is a reliable curator and reddit cant remain solvent if the algorithm is broken reddit is looking death in the face
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is ridiculous of course people are handling this transition poorly because it literally places their lives in danger take your get off my lawn bullshit else wheres friendo mjbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what transition are you referring to out of curiosity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol you realize that thedonald is the biggest echo chamber on this site right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ brd take my energy ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cannot for the life of me figure out how to use it is it like facebook ie you post something people comment on the post and the whole thing is visible in your feed as opposed to reddit where you need to go one level in to read the comments
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,overdesign is a on my years old netbook reddit is about the only social site that doesnt load like crap because of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its a real shame i mean reddit is probably the only website i like the layout of i did like tumblrs but that got ruined regularly and the guy who fixed it was harassed of the site
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that sort of joke is against the imzy community guidelines so e its funny that this sort of thing will be accused of totalitarian censorship by bigots when its literally the same code of conduct that those of us in civilized society abide by every day if i made an attack helicopter joke at my job hr would be intervening immediately and rightly so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah yes the original and hilarious attack helicopter joke s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes and theyll ban hate speech no matter how weaselly or lawyery it is the words are the words no matter how they try to frame it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they just released a new update
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know but i expect not its more difficult to moderate a site if its trivial for scripts to create new accounts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i made some communities of my own like spoonies for people living with chronic illnesses or opshopping for garage sales and thrift shop finds or birbloaf so you can find fun stuff through me at least
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well imzy would have more people if people signed up and participated rather than waiting for others
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edgy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that part of the song gives me the shivers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is under pressure to grow once you let bigots take over everyone else starts to leave while the bigoted segment of the population continues to grow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think this is my favourite image now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it got made into a smiley highfive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shutting down fph caused a weeklong tantrum on the site yeah even less really it was around days but then everything went back to normal and there was indeed much less hatred and harassment of people based on their weights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder if mods could ban td users in preparation and then make temporary karma restrictions for posting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what was fph im fairly new to reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is your flair new because its really funny i should dye my kneebeards
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,basically that quarantined subs dont show ads its a pretty big indicator right there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,valuable conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even voat cant stand them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the most hopeful thing ive read today
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,damnit i was just getting started with that individual i was curious to see what his experience actually was he was starting to be interesting with his management and hr suppositions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i will not rest until we take back first place i kid i kid dont hurt me i love srs to death
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the posts show up styled like facebook but if you click on the comments chat bubble icon it takes you to something that looks like a reddit comment thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it feels clunky
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is of the reason the site is so popular its very very clean
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mildly autistic and as left as they come here but thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i expected as much reddits doubleedged sword that one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i tried playing it in osu it was so fuckin hard but doable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so the question spez is probably answering by letting td stay is is ti worth driving out the normal people in order to maintain the worlds premeir altright forum
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ask and ye shall receive brd is generous birb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a coordinated assault could get around that but i think its for the best they keep a sign up freeze in your back pocket in case
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fatpeoplehate a subreddit dedicated to bullying fat people people they thought were fat and women in general it was a thing and they eventually got so bad with the rule breaking and bringing negative attention to reddit that the admins had to shut it down
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rfatpeoplehate as the name suggests it was a subreddit dedicated to hating fat people it was banned from the site due to multiple rule violations vote manipulations bullying a suicidal girl probably more they pitched a fit and then left reddit for voat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive had it for a couple of weeks now i think its from an angry rant that was posted to srs a while back
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit was a mistake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats the one i was thinking about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like mad men but with poorly dressed nerds also later
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit look at those comments
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sure hell be happy to enlighten you in pm seems like the kind of person who likes to talk about their le important real life expeeeeeriunce
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive noticed young people tend to shut down when faced with these obstacles and they dont know a healthy way to react and overcome thats funny because i have noticed the exact same thing in older conservative white men when they find themselves working with or as subordinates to muslim female or lgbtq coworkers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,might i enquire a bit about the length and breadth of your work experience no corporate entities need to be expressed but industry and role would be interesting to know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oooh i love when they tell us what they think a safe space is some guy came to the feminist club at my schools meeting and had a similar idea in mind about what safe spaces are for the record as delightful as having a room with play doe and dogs sounds thats not really what a safe space is everything from thedonald to aa meetings could be classified as safe spaces not sure where these ridiculous notions come from edit he came back again tonight and we had to have the same discussion he feels personally affronted by safe spaces apparently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but we can and should call people bigots and misogynists if thats how theyre acting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know most people dont actually want their lives to suck right like being emotionally stable and having the resources to talk about your problems available to you are good things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the difference being that the two subs you mentioned have no rules that state no dissent and do not ban people the moment they disagree
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh cool cheers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,too bad the vermin that populate it are anything but
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im glad that you didnt turn out to be an oblivious techbro
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a lot of their users also moved to fatlogic and fatpeoplestories
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a redditor accusing anyone of tinfoil hattery hilarious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we should purge the site and all its users only way to be sure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol maybe i will finally get a mudflap pm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,life is very affronting when you cant mind your own business
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was being kind of rhetorical but the point still stands that yeah by not banning td hes already showing us what matters more ironically i think if hed let reddit grow without trash then it would have appealed to a broader audience that doesnt want peen pun threads on every link but what do i know im not ceo of a neonazi website
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats probably true for vc funding because venture capitalists are not well known for their strong moral sensibilities and have a particular blind spot when it comes to the relationship between a company eventually being profitable and not being a trashfire advertisers on the other hand care a lot about what content their brand is going to be associated with the more established and potentially lucrative the advertiser the more they care institutional buyers have similar issues as was demonstrated by twitters failure the other month to find a company willing to rescue it reddits goal for advertising is to convince buyers its a premium brand worth spending top dollar for a textad because of the opportunity for community engagement it cant do that if those ads are attached to a pool of toxic waste
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love this birb but may i ask what the centerpede is in ref to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the hilarious thing is that once youve been here a while that wont even be a little bit surprising any more
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah and you will frequently see former uses of that sub claim it was all about motivation this is of course not how to motivate someone to get healthy because it doesnt work and it was complete bullshit they made up after the fact you also used to be able to get verified on there by sending the mods a picture of yourself to prove you werent overweight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,absolutely thedonald users call themselves centipedes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whaaaaat centipedes are not bros not at all true facts about your humble mod i lived for a while in an area with gargantuous centipedes that were poisonous and was known for killing them no quarter given many a time was i called into a friends room dispatch a hideous buggo normally i love bugs and always catch and release but these guys are bastards
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh is it an unexpected bout of selfawareness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its from some weird youtube trump mashup video its why they call themselves nimble navigators too despite its impressive length its a nimble navigator and some can be highly venomous just like the tarantula its killing the centipede has two curved hollow fangs which inject paralyzing venom the centipede is a predator theyre pretty much human centipedes with trump at the head so i guess it works
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all centipedes are poisonous just the smaller ones arent able to bite humans theyre not pleasant things at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats the difference between a sexual predator and a sexual redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whatt the difference between a us election and a bunch of sly midgets one is a bunch of cunning runts and the other is a bunch of running cunts at utc fullymeasured replied to whatt the difference between a us election and a bunch of sly midgets one is a bunch of cunning runts and the other is a bunch of running cunts httpiimgurcomgborxpgpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is there one though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of them has a p sound at the beginning of the second word other than that i cant think of a difference
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats why im asking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sexual predators have a chance of making jokes that are actually funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres another comment from op in holy shit the over reaction in this thread is psychotic he gave her a smack he didnt knock her the fuck out dont you want that girl to grow up and be a proper member of society unlike you fat lonely bitches on this sub forum who drown out truth with down votes and up vote anything that makes you feel better about being an abomination that no one wants to marry or procreate with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont somebody think of the poor poor domestic abuser i am suuuuuure that female did something to deserve it cause you know im a horrible misogynist piece of utter human trash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes yes its always the female to blame
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder how these same people reacted to ray rice beating his wife
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine how theyd react if an arab muslim was released for a repeated history of domestic abuse savages barbarians glass the middle east
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually it pretty much always is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,football player is released for repeated history of domestic abuse you folks sitting in your cubicles need to chill the fuck out relationships are often times fucked up and the man isnt always fully to blame at utc randymarshbroncos replied to reddit is so fucking annoying every year theres a new bandwagon issue that legit no one can have an opinion on the giants and every other organization are a business and not the court of law theyre not investigators or judges you folks sitting in your cubicles need to chill the fuck out relationships are often times fucked up and the man isnt always fully to blame lets jump off your single till the age of high horse and find the next issue to silence every opinion on every response in this thread is the same robotic bullshit do you folks even enjoy hearing yourselves all day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,based on the username how few posts hes made and the overthetop tone of almost all his posts i tried to convince myself that this is a novelty account but i dont think it is in any case that wouldnt explain the hundreds of upvotes and gilding anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,innocent until proven the victim didnt deserve it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sometimes people beat their wives therefore its okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look at braggy miss braggerson holed up in her sheltered privileged relationship where she doesnt constantly fear her spouse might endanger their family and doesnt have to deal with the intricacies of pushing through last minute resistance in bed for most of us its a warzone out there s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well he is inherently more violent here is a list of bullshit made up reasons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but lets give it up to the true heroes everyone single dads
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,op is redpilian btw wouldnt expect anything less from a member of deranged cult
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we can laugh all the day at this but try just for a moment to follow the logic here found single moms on tinder assume single moms want him to pay for their kids college leave tinder find yourself in the tinder subreddit suggest single moms to send kids to the military
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,new tinder profile if youre a single mom i already hate you for being after my money and ive already decided i would rather you send your children overseas to maybedie than help them succeed what a timesaver now ladies will know never to contact this person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why even hate a single woman with a kid do they hate widows too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,plenty of reasons to not date single parents their lack of free time not wanting kids around obligationsresponsibilities dealing with the other parent etc nope reddits gotta jump straight to every feeeeeeeeeemale just wants my vidya game money and slurs good thing women dont want to let single white men around their children in the first place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im surprised these kids are even old enough to work let alone date
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tinder didnt immediately gratify my penis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this dude left tinder because no one wanted to go out with his creepy ass
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the first sentence is okay and then like it sinks with each subsequent sentence the breed of people who grew up with absolutely no checks and balances on the kind of things they were allowed to say
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do tinder dates usually involve paying for your dates kids college education that seems like a big leap
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how much you want to bet that guy has never and never will be in the armed forces
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,speaking as a veteran i would much rather we spent money on people here than on another pointless war the whole just join the army hurf durf doesnt really hold water for me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the world needs cannon fodder too agreed i recommend all the basement dwelling racist white redditors for operation human shield
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,then what are you doing on rtinder edit just kidding we all of course know that the answer is screaming about women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors dont realize most of them are cannon fodder
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the works needs cannon fodder too how republican of you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but how can an unemployable neet even of think himself as an atm we have to make so many assumptions in order to perceive this guy as capable of producing anything of value to society and you know what they say about making assumptions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so then would this person be okay with legislation to neuter any man that doesnt take the responsibilities of creating new life seriously ran off and left your wife with the kids youre effin neutered mate that would actually probably be very effective can we do that on a more serious note theres a very toxic underlying idea there that a single mother couldnt be well off and employed in the first place that someone is a single mother doesnt mean that they cant ever be employed its like paid carers and housekeepers dont exist in their world and really if youre very much into someone does money matter ive always put having someone to connect with over money i mean right now im fighting the newly hyperracist uk for my partners right to immigrate which is costing a lot of money and shes putting in a lot of money too because having a lot of cash isnt as important as being together weve been together for six years on the internet and weve spent a year together in person and its all been bloody fantastic theres a special quality to meeting someone who actually understands you whom you could trust with anything i dont think that these kinds of guys really understand the value of that it goes well beyond money so what can i say here really hes just a very wrongfaced guy on all counts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im surprised these guys have yet to admit the real problem they have with single moms the hard evidence that god forbid there was another guy before them theyd rather jump to an absurdly far fetched conclusion before the first date i dont doubt they truly believe that conclusion though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only acceptable to the question what is wrong with tinder is fuckboys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh darn he found me out also wanna take bets on if le redditor was actually in the military
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i stopped using tinder back in january of the skanks on there are single moms i hate single moms do i look like an atm to you no im not paying for your kids college let them join the military the world needs cannon fodder too at utc doofuscpa replied to i stopped using tinder back in january of the skanks on there are single moms i hate single moms do i look like an atm to you no im not paying for your kids college let them join the military the world needs cannon fodder too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a bunch of beta cucks reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey thats going too far dont you know that theyre very sympathetic towards pedophiles rapists fascists and gsmphobes only applies if said pedophilerapistgsmphobe is white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that would explain the tryhard edginess that makes him sound like a belligerent uncle who only gets invited to holiday meals because people feel sorry for him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats like half of rtinder
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id at least expect the mods to remove this sort of crap but hey its rtinder if the community is any indication the mods are assholes who condone misogyny and revel in the attention it gives then fucking pricks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,having a girlfriend both disqualifies you from rtheredpill and rtinder so this makes sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,op is redpilian btw i think its no coincidence i read op is reptilian btw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that implies they already do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they hate women plain and simple theyll disguise it as some other sort of hatred but thats it they just hate women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,red pill two x chromosomes what are you some kind of freak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i admire single parents but for many reasons id prefer not to pursue one one being that id feel less privacy around nonlovers in the same residence or vehicle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just feel bad when i match with someone who is a single mom but doesnt specify in her profile and i end up having to unmatch
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly starting out on this comment i was like umm this isnt so bad then i got towards the end and went completely nope i have personally nothing against women who are single mothers sometime life gets dealt a bad hand and such and i could still be friends with them but many in their early might not want to jump into that complexity many activities just wouldnt be as feasible because of the kid let alone but to have your sole reason as she is after my money is unbelievably silly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i have my own rules for not dating single moms and none of them are because they want my money most are because im way too immature and selfish to handle that sort of commitment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trump dodged the draft lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,make the gamergoobers break out the notyourshield sockpuppets again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lets not do that for good or bad everyone has an impact on the world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and you know what they say about making assumptions they make you more likely to vote trump
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly that sounds so sweet best of luck to you both and dont let the racists let you down
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree with you about money while i dont believe that myth that everyone only has one possible true love i do believe that if youre connecting so well to someone else a lot of things shouldnt matter especially money unless youll both starve thats no good kids might be another issue altogether though a lot of people recognize they just plain arent ready to be a parent or step parent and part of their choice may be focused on not messing up that childs life by being a little too immature to properly raise them but anyway this guys reason is pure hatred rather than anything romantic logical mature or anything else oh and congratulations d sounds like you found someone very special
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey im somewhat new round these parts whats gsm i tried googling it but that wasnt much help
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think its called sympathy when theyre just accepting themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont worry those women just dodged a bullet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pretty sure you were serious go away
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think that is backwards since the internet has gained popularity and use by more than just a privileged few social justice activism of various kinds seems to have increased with it plus given how segregated most places still are just knowing your neighbors probably wont help much with getting to know about diverse kinds of folks and lifestyles and families speaking for myself without the internet i would probably still be an edgelord asshole and its not like the nazis needed internet to spread their hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,k
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sure its in the upper range
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly all the sexist assholes on dating websites really lower the bar for us nondouchebag guys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if theres one thing they hate more than women its disenfranchised women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,single dad brave and hardworking single mom obviously should have just kept her legs closed and are golddiggerss
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny thingthe fact you are selfaware enough to decide you are too immature to handle childrearing that puts yout orders of magnitude ahead of most redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone has an impact on the world i see what you did there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,definitely that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its difficult to explain its not necessarily a one true love situation but i suppose my perspective is skewed due to neurodiversity the issue for me is that my potential compatibility is severely dropped as im prone to making people uncomfortable by being generally weird its in part how i can talk matteroffactly about strange things with an uncommon desire for depth its overloaded a lot of people ive met and they havent really wanted to talk much with me for that reason so even finding friends has been something of an ordeal as i said thats kind of skewed my perspective in regards to compatibility as you can imagine there are few people whod want to sit and listen to me drone on about things unless theyre also passionate and especially interested and thats what i have with my partner we can just talk for hours and hours sometimes well talk and wonder where the day has gone and were very good at listening to one another i dont encounter that much maybe ive just been really unlucky or perhaps this is a thing where im an autistic introvert and the people around me all tend to be more extroverted really there are lots of things i could blame but ultimately it falls squarely at my feet for being me its not anyone elses fault that theyre them either i dont blame anyone for finding me a lot to deal with even right now im writing up a wall of text because with a lot of subjects being succinct is an alien concept to me even about minor things i can still write a lot so ultimately i apologise if my perspective is skewed it can be a little difficult to put into perspective how a relationship works without people whose brains arent like mine what connects them what the basis for the foundations of their relationship is and ultimately the things theyre passionate about that might keep them together ive tried relationships many times in the past but its broken down because ultimately all of my prior attempts have ultimately been with people whove wanted somewhat more extroverted partners not even an extrovert per se but a person who can at least do smalltalk i cant smalltalk i could sooner breach the einsteinrosen bridge
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gender andor sexual minorities terminology that is considered by many including me to be more inclusive than the acronym lgbt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah im with you internet has done wonders to open my eyes on many things including social justice it has eroded my racism made me a staunch feminist cured my homohobia and opened my eyes regarding the poverty trap and how much harder the poor have to work just to keep their heads above water
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of women sleep with the upper of men namely the ones who arent giant douchebags and biotroof
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes saying you hate single moms not parents and then blatantly saying theyre looking to take all your money is misogynistic this is some basic shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some black women too and muslim women they probably really hate disenfranchised black muslim women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a weird difference in perceived agency a single mother is seen as being directly or indirectly responsible for her position she should have kept her legs closed andor chose a better man to be the father of her children a single father is perceived as being the unwitting but brave victim of either tragedy eg death of his spouse or the failure of a woman to be a good mother and so he just had to step in so no matter what sex you are as a single parent the general perception is that a woman caused it its bizarre
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me too thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no this is srs were always totally serious about our hatred of the white man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe if you looked outside youd find out all you needed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did i make a reference or something because i was being serious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i can relate to that in a lot of ways i am awful at small talk very introverted and also have a need for my partner my husband to be on the same kind of level mentallysocially so that we can connect that way while i know its impossible for me or anyone to know how you truly feel inside your own mind i think i can relate to a lot of what youre saying i apologize though if it sounded like i was saying anything against your relationship or against you when i said one true love i meant like thats a thing i hear in the outside world i personally think theres some different possibilities for everyone but some more than others i was just agreeing that money shouldnt be a thing if people are connecting so well and so deeply it really does sound like youve found someone so special and thats wonderful good luck with her immigration it can be tough and a very long process sounds like its fully worth it and youll be so glad im sure when it all goes through in the end
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you i think i like it better too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am a fan of this i will update my vocabulary to include it instead of lgbt it really is a much smarter and more inclusive term lovely that my compliments to whomever coined it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,damn thats a good acronym using that thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey this is a new one to me but i like it too its short and to the point but its still inclusive nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh man i was worried that people loved cdma as opposed to the cell service used throughout the world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the same i used to feel quite sorry for myself as a disabled person i mean sure i have a lot to deal with but the truth is is that anyone whos ever suffered a harsh situation due to equality and prejudice is kindred in my book a person whom i wont turn away from or turn around and hate upon its important to me its why im always ready to learn and update my vocabulary i actually care about not hurting people its an interesting division i think that offensiveness isnt important because everyones going to be offended by something and theyll kick up a fuss about nothing most of the time but when something hurts when its actually dehumanising when it undermines you if its debilitating and it impacts your ability to have a happy and full life that kind of thing is when you sit up and take notice one person may think that one comment isnt harmful even if it is hrtful but when you add that to the millions of other comments which are all doing the same thing thats when it becomes bullying and thats when its going to make people suffer the person will never really weigh how damaging the collective insult is if one person says it it hurts but you can get past it if a million people are saying it then you cant get away from it and its going to eat away at you itll erode you from the inside and it can even turn cancerous it can become a whispered suicidal intent i recall that i used to call redheads gingers not trying to be horrible person or anything but i simply didnt know better i was always sensitive to their plight and what theyve gone through its really sickened me but i didnt know that ginger had been weaponised against them as something hurtful a word that had become synonymous with ugliness i was very upset to learn that so i quickly updated my vocabulary to use redhead instead and i think thats important its basic human decency to just not hurt people thats how it should be right if everyone were willing to actually take the time to understand whats hurtful and to resist any urge to engage in it for whatever reason understanding the powerfully negative effect it can have on another human being well then wed probably all be liir web search time or the pkunk depending on how quirky you are and really wed be better i think thats the important effort to make anyway and its one that we all make and that can always be a point of pride
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,praise to the mods they removed this pissbabys comments what was he saying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,truly the stars of bigotry have aligned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not a racistsexist i hate everyone equally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibettyshabazz
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats a self aware pupper
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was the cannon fodder thing then impact i think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i tend to not discard terminology based on the fact that some terrible people might use it for their own twisted needs there are more than a few lesbian gay bi trans and intersex and ace people who prefer gsm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre welcome im glad you liked it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so much this im mentally applauding here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that he was just being kinda mean and whys it always gotta be sexist the usual
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a man and a woman have a child together the woman develops a drug addiction childrens services gets involved the man ends up a single parent the common perception is that hes brave doing his best against nearinsurmountable odds to keep his little family together reverse the sexes the common perception now is that shes reaping what she sowed and she should have been more careful about who she slept with interestingly theres also a big difference in how society views the parent who left a woman leaves her husband and child behind shes a literal monster a man does it at worst hed be considered a bit of a loser but often not even that society in general sees the highest calling for a woman is to be a mother if she fucks that up then shes seen as an utter failure and bordering on evil if a man fucks up at being a father then its ok some woman will bail him out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a tiny little self aware doggo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh i get it now wow i am so clever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i heard that kinksters have eyes that glow on full moons and that theyre taking jobs away from hard working nonkinksters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no rule x
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh of course the usual apologia fucking pissbabies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uff makemexicopays comment made me throw up in my mouth a little
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quickly the antibrigade spell brigadus cancelus
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,considering about of dudes pee in alleyways on the way home from a bar its amazing how rare these stories of registered sex offenders are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these are the same people that stereotype countries like india and china for the same thing and make remarks like lol that country is a literal toilet but itd be perfectly okay if a pedophile were to hypothetically go outside and piss in public because uh reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,public urination and indecent exposure are two different things in most states public urination usually results in a fine indecent exposure is usually requires the person to have intentions of sexually offendingarousing the victim however there are some rare cases where the prosecutors try to charge the public urinator with public lewdness or indecency which can end you up on the sex offender registry now im not sure how often that happens but im sure its rare i think that most prosecutors will just prosecute a public urinator with public urination and leave it at that and i also think that most sex offenders just use the pissing in public as an excuse to cover up what they really done
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he frequents the league of legends subreddit shocker
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no really officer i wasnt masturbating i was just peeing when you gotta go you gotta go right haha whats that children over there oh my goodness i didnt even notice those little tykes silly me what an embarrassing gaffe whats that erection my penis erect well i suppose if you look at it from that angle it could appear well i assure you its only a coincidence as i said before i was absolutely not masturbating to those children but merely urinating in this bush
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh brd its been awhile since this favorite reddit myth has been posted to trivialize the sex offender registry reddit rapists and apologists love to unite under the public urination flag ucakevodka had and check out any states sex offender registry nary a pee offender in sight nope its all rape this and sexual assault of a minor that ──────── unjerk below i was going to put the below in srsd but it seems to be roped off at the moment okay i got curious how many people are on sex offender registries for the crime of public urination googlefu comes up with only one name and i say name because as these are public registries and all convictions are a matter of public record it should be dead easy to find not just how many but exactly who is on the states registries for which crimes note that public urination doesnt seem to ever have itself as a crime but rather often falls under a lewd conduct sort of thing i tracked down a page describing one states sex offender registry rules and the penal codes listed requiring it were all pretty serioussounding the page even concludes by pointing out that people arrested only for public urination can easily be charged under laws that do not place them on the registry that one name juan matamoros hes literally the source for every single public urination sex offender registry story youve ever heard it all started in when the story spread over the interwebs like wildfire after a local report from daytona beach was picked up on msnbccom it even made it to fark which some of you older folks who wear onions on your belts may recall was the reddit of its day heres a tidbit a deltona sex offender was told he needed to move monday after being found in violation of a may city ordinance though he said the offense was urinating in public after drinking alcohol to celebrate his daughters birth years ago the took the stand before volusia county judge peter marshall in deland on monday to say he never molested anyone back in but just got drunk and urinated at the side of a car along a massachusetts street when three people passed by and saw him the only information in the national sex registry states that matamoros is guilty of two counts of open and gross lewd and lascivious behavior details of the original case in essex mass were not immediately available the story goes on to talk about his two young kids and his wife and how he pleads to not have to move to a neighborhood with a high concentration of actual sex offenders cause of his kids the article really is kind of heartstringtugging so i can see why people got caught up in it does anyone know how public urination could lead to two counts but heres the thing theres no information no factual information the only fact anyone has is that he was convicted of two counts of open and gross lewd and lascivious behavior its only matamoros claim that it was merely public urination no ones publicized any further details of the essex ma case one might be inclined to sympathize with matamoros except five years later he gets booked for still not registering as a sex offender in volusia county volusia county public records may county jail docket the following people were booked into the volusia county branch jail on felony charges yet to be proven in court juan hernandez matamoros orange city failure to properly register as a sexual offender so my sympathy shrinks a bit anyway thats the only case i could find and im good at finding things i think it unlikely i missed anything since every website that talks about public urination sex offender registry and mentions any cases mentions that specific one and that one only one site also mentions this case from in which a man james birch convicted of engaging in lewd and dissolute conduct in a public place exposed himself outside a bar where he said he was urinating petitioned the ca supreme court and got his conviction overturned for many reasons including the fact that the state did not properly inform him of his right to legal counsel which he waived or that if he were convicted hed have to register as a sex offender but thats it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can this meme die already i was irritated when they trotted it out on ointb this season not really a spoiler
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what about all those registered sex offenders who were just out peeing in some bushes in reply to on if the intent isnt sexual it isnt a sex offence thats not at all how that works yes i was jerking it while groping the blonde on the train but my thoughts were pure you cant arrest me also its definitely illegal to expose yourself in public in britain at utc kalayo wrote prude what about all those registered sex offenders who were just out peeing in some bushes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was about to go i didnt know runexpected had so many assholes but then i remembered this is reddit and im getting used to going i didnt know rinsert totally innocuous subject here had so many assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this but ironically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at first i thought that this was going to be related to transpeople perhaps not then i reread his message and suspected that bushes was a euphemism for something that some women have but perhaps thats just my mind in the gutter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a progressive who is against the us sex offender registry the public urination thing is a bad umbrella to unite under its a pretty rare thing to get convicted over a much better example would be how like ‰ of people on the registry were on there for things they did as a minor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look at his comment history or dont its pretty fucking awful hmm its a fairly new accounti wonder
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how shocking i wouldve expected nothing but quality posting from a username like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,flair checks out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thing i miss after moving to portland no alleys anywhere in the inner city
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they arent rare they dont even exist so far not a single person has been charged for this when peeing in public
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no no every redditor is an individual theres definitely no overlap of shitty opinions s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its funny i used to do this thing where id pm the person talking about all those poor innocent men who just needed to take a leak and ask them for a zip code any zip code didnt have to be theirs just any one then id look up the sex offender registry for that zip code and copypaste the results of that search for them i have never once found a single person who was convicted of a public urination charge on there lots of sexual assault but nobody peeing in the bushes seriously try it look up your zip code of youre in the us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the sex offender registry is posted online i defy you to find someone let alone many people who are on there for pissing in public
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah his username is already nauseating why wouldnt any other expression from him be anything but gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i forgot reddit totally isnt a hive mind s its not like this site has an upvote system that just coincidentally happens to be used to push bigoted comments to the top or that the people who make these shitty upvoted comments always happen to be regulars at the same subs also totally by coincidence btw or have similar comment histories or anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh wow that makes me sick just to know there so many perverts in my area i did skim through and i found one for indecent exposure and he lives on my street now that could be for pissing in public but idk edit did some googling nope he wasnt pissing in public he was masturbating in his car that being said im sure there might have been very few cases of someone urinating in public getting put on the sex registry because some court systems are backwards and corrupt but it isnt a common thing at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where do i check the registry i need to know what im dealing with areawise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,er that seems a bit harsh to put someone on the sex offender list for masturbating in their caraside from whatever circumstances
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats crazy is you didnt know before these people should be made way more visible and accountable for the things theyve done if youre not going to be in prison we might as well know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can do a google search for your states registry or go to one of these sites the department of justices sexual offender registry the fbis list httpsmfbigovhttpswwwfbigovscamssafetyregistry or pm me the zipcode you want searched and ill search it and send it to you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i sorta agree idk what the guys intentions were dude was masturbating in his car where people could see him if the dude was homeless and really needed to beat his meat he could have found somewhere to pull over thats way more private
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pmd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the absolute fuckin height of comedy right here folks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are only two genders excuse me get your science out of our subreddit thats not science you dolts aaaaarrrrrrrrrrggggg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spam scattered around personalityless gamers are the reason i rarely i tell anyone that i play dota or csgo and at least half the reason i cant be bothered to play them anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i miss the days when humor was about being funny and not about being as offensive as possible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,transphobia is funny upvotes to the left
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now we just need another attack helicopter then ill have reddit bingo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just so boring at this point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hahaha im laughing so hard at this joak xd😂😂😂😂😂😎😎😎😎
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where did this meme even come from i dont remember any gradual growth it was just there one day when i woke up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youd think that sub would be low hanging fruit like even gamers look down on cs players as being trash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shitposter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh yeah this is why i quit playing that shitty game
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit that joke was so funny i almost choked on my tongue from laughing so hard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did they just assume his gender triggered at utc vnovahd replied to did they just assume his gender
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black people are stupid because phrenology and homosexuality is a mental illness excuse me get your science out of our subreddit s obviously reddit in a nutshell its science if it agrees with me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,obligatory reality check this happens irl feels bad man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but its the sjws who are misusing it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair its far too easy to make fun of people who say things like its literally something something something just a shame that altrighties are using the joke the most
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i remember when it wasnt endless repetition of said shock humor people dont even bother being witty or creative anymore and yet they still get social approval
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae people with trauma are stupid and it went on from there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i run into so many people online who believe that its cool to joke about shit like this because no one would ever really make fun of someone whos just been through trauma to their face its just jokes were just laughing about it but no really people will take this to the real world people will be entertained by bullying a child whos been raped and those people are worthless shitdicks not fun provocative edgelords
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but the good ol nonpc days thats why we make fun of oppressed people being upset instead of just the oppressed people directly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean middle school
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its so hard to distinguish the two as of right now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they say until they want to say that their country trying to do something decent for the world or false rape accusations make them feel vulnerable and exploited as white men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so the old lonely guy who is shelling out a year to cover her tuition and living expenses in exchange for a few hours a month of companionship is he the bad guy﻿ yes you fuckwit hes abusing someone whos vulnerable for his own benefit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,apparently being a well educated adult attending an elite school means you cant be vulnerable and exploited as well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they are not going for the bootstraps tactic here or feeeeeeemale privilege
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae women cant be exploited
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember the episode of community where pierce was paying for annies rent and then threatening to humiliate her in front of the study group if she didnt do his bidding this isnt much different
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how the article paint these women who are adults well educated and attending elite schools as vulnerable and exploited at utc camberiu replied to i love how the article paint these women who are adults well educated and attending elite schools as vulnerable and exploited so the old lonely guy who is shelling out a year to cover her tuition and living expenses in exchange for a few hours a month of companionship is he the bad guy﻿ edit no it is not the high cost of tuition that is driving women into prostitution the girl on this article attends columbia which costs in tuition right next door to it there is cuny a fine university that charges in tuition so prostitution hardly seems like the only choice to get a college degree yes cuny is not columbia but it is a fine university with a very accessible price tag columbia is and always was an elite school and as the title implies it was never meant to be accessible to most of us there is no god given right to go to columbia but hey if you are willing to prostitute yourself in order to attend an elite school knock yourself out just dont blame society capitalism the patriarchy or whatever for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but hes being so noble
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and now you know the mentality behind the people who dont care about the rampant cases of rape on college campuses
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only straight white men can be victims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its simple take the definition of a word and carefully create a slightly askew definition by analogy claim that the dictionary supports your interpretation more accurately than your opponent an then proceed to browbreat them with the argument until they quit and go do something more important than debating smug smartypantses
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is fine with basically owning people lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brigading ourselves again it seems
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is not the usual racism sexism etc but i feel like making a joke about the death of such an amazing person is revolting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on the topic of steve irwin he should have worn his sunscreen that blocks harmful rays in reply to goatofmendes on he should have been more afraid of sting rays at utc supersmith wrote he should have worn his sunscreen that blocks harmful rays
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mcfarlane is a shitty writer i remember a few years back family guy was coming out with an episode about trans people and he was swearing up and down that they handled the issue with dignity and respect and people will be impressed httpsbitchmediaorgpostfamilyguyreachingnewtransmysogyniclows and single handily made me stop watching it i wasnt even big into social justice issues then and i felt gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,looking at the thread now posted hours ago this effort post is hours old currently i have to say im impressed how everything ended up top comments are critical of the scene and of seth macfarlane across the board i had to scroll down pretty far before i saw anyone defending it reddit youve done an okay job with your votes this one time on the other hand the first defense i saw of le joak was also the only gilded comment i saw in the thread the phrase a fool and his money are soon parted comes to mind lmao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is my first effort post if i did anything incorrectly please just let me know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mother of godi didnt even know this scene existed mcfarlane has a supremely fucked up mind i stopped watching family guy years ago and knowing this exists has fully convinced me to never watch anything mcfarlane produces againnot that that would be particularly difficult i am glad though that the top comments are calling him out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mein gott awful shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rape is funny guis xd xd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the most recent episode i watched was also rife with rape jokes and the entire stewybrian subplot was mocking autism the show hasnt improved even a little bit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy fuck so glad i only watched a couple of episodes years ago
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thatll do pig thatll do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny how you are complaining about people coming into thedonald and downvoting but you feel the need to come into srs after stalking my profile to comment on a months old post enjoy the ben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry i feel strongly i guess yeah these comments made me mad yeah i commented a lot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and youre the guy who said this mcfarlanes rationale for the joke wasnt justified imo but id hate to be so shallow to judge someones morality based off what cartoons they like for fucks sake about a cartoon that made a rape joke so say hi to ben for me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what does calling out the op for something they said have anything to do with the content of this post do you actually have anything to contribute besides being a dick
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont notice race but do you know that black people do the most crimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats actually the opposite of the truth studies show kids have developed negative stereotypes about minority groups by the time theyre years old
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,typical redditors making an innocent gif about race
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fun fact try being that naive when it comes to hiring someone marrying them or having kids together it magically starts becoming a problem for lots of people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly this dude has never lived in kentucky
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont care about your race i just pretend you are white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so my parents take in foster children because of that i have a little sister from kongo when i was going for a walk with her she saw a few horses most of them white and one was brown she pointed at the brown one and yelled look it is just like meeee the idea that children dont see color and how society treats them different based on that is bullshit straight taken from south climate change aint real park
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre a trump voter because of course they are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if only it were so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and theyre all active td posters what a surprise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow uh no this is scarily ignorant the doll test instrumental for brown v boe proved that this is not the case and paved the way for civil rights in the first place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most people are ignorant point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,notice how kids dont notice color or race as a problem fun fact most people dont in reply to beyondstellar on notice how kids dont notice color or race as a problem at utc iamnotdrunk wrote fun fact most people dont
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh my gosh i live in indiana and we had a family in our neighborhood that was latino as well as another that was black my sister would watch them like a hawk and report any actions she could to us it was not a bad area no more evidence of them being a criminal than any of the other families in the neighborhood but she would come back to us with oh they pulled out of their garage oh they are heading this direction on the street the kids are playing basketball my parents were finally like child this is kind of racist no idea where she learned it from
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pssh who needs studies when redditors have their opinions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,since were just telling anecdotes in this thread i remember growing up i actually wasnt exposed to much racism i specifically remember my parents telling me several times that judging people on the skin color was bad but as i got older turns out my parents are actually racist as fuccckk just in the sociallyacceptable bill cosby was right dogwhistle sort of way you should really get my dad going on blm its fun for the whole family
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i worked in a kindergarten for a while a group of girls said they didnt want to hang out with a black girl cos she isnt like us this was a year old saying that to me pretty awful stuff im not even in the us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt it at least true that those are learned and not natural though i can take some hope from that i think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,innocent gif as if this isnt just more propaganda to hide the fact that the police are an oppressive force used to control working class minorities
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit lets take totally innocent things and make them about race or sex reddit hey lets not bring race into this obviously racial situation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but my education in stem tells me social issues go away as long as you ignore them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or browsed rall even once
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not racist i hate everyone equally can confirm am hermit veteran
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre all so damn bad at this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep i lived in minny my entire life and in grade i was friends with this kid who was biracial one day one of my friends comes up and says marksuperduper why are you friends with hes black it was super weird because hes family is pretty progressive i dont think he knew it was racist but he says he regrets and did end up becoming pretty good friends with him so i dont hold it against him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder what its like to have to confront your childs racism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,put five kids in a room by the end of an hour one of them is going to get punched for being different by the end of a week its full on gang warfare kids are kids they do stupid shit if you spend enough time around kids you discover all the horrible stupid things adults do occurring entirely organically it puts a lot of things in perspective the difference between kids and adults is supposed to be that adults recognize often through trial and error also through education from ones elders that shortsighted illconsidered and badly executed behaviors end up doing you more harm than good but some people never grow the fuck up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,facts change but opinions are forever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i specifically remember my parents telling me several times that judging people on the skin color was bad but as i got older turns out my parents are actually racist as fuccckk and this is how we got a whole generation of millennials who insist racism is bad but also that racism is over and are actually racist as fuck we taught kids that racism is bad but not what racism actually is same goes for sexism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had the same experience i hate that it took me as late as my early twenties to realize all the different faces of racism outside of the most blatantobvious i dont hate black people i just hate ns haha my dad haha yeah i agree and also this is a totally ok way to think teenage me and also the seemingly vocal majority of people ns are the black people who act differently than the way i think they should if i wasnt being clear i dont hate black people i want to reiterate that and also im smart my dad yes indeed i agree and i am also very smart teenage me and also the seemingly vocal majority of people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for putting it into words its the worst kind of feeling to realize how much of a shithead youve been for most of your life and how you thought things you saw or did or said were totally okay and totally not racist because just because they werent obviously plastered with swastikas and burning crosses like jesus i remember when i was a small child one of my black friends father passed away my mom and i were extended an invitation to the funeral my friends dad was involved in the hiphop music scene and a lot of his musician friends attended the funeral of course they all dressed well and acted appropriately like you do at a funeral but my mom got all uncomfortable because they were hood types and she didnt feel safe with them there of course i was like so i didnt really understand it and just went along with what she wanted to do told my friend sorry and we headed out i never even thought about it until recently its almost mindblowingly abhorrent when i think about it it was a funeral for a little girls father what ridiculous situation did she construct in her head where that could have possibly been unsafe what could these guys possibly have done they were all in mourning same as the rest of us if the musicians who attended the funeral had been more urbane or whatnot and not black we probably would have stuck around so i could spend the rest of the day with my friend the kicker is that my moms not even a whitebread american shes white but she immigrated from mexico when she was a teenager and shes always been very vocal about being a liberal type she supports civil rights and has friends from all kinds of backgrounds she tried to teach me not to be judgmentaland yet shes still pulled stuff like this every so often where did i learn it from where did she learn it from its so deeply rooted and pervasive and so subtle that half the time when you grow up with this stuff racism doesnt even register with you im still in the process of trying to be selfaware and critical and call things out when they arent okay at least i have a good understanding of why people with a similar upbringing to me get so defensive when theyre called out on racist stuff they legitimately dont see theres an issue because theyve been taught throughout their life that racism is over it doesnt exist they think that other people are oversensitive when in reality theyre just conditioned to be blind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yah theye learned the research also shows us the fix diversity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,probably learned since white and black children are biased against black people its a little hard to say for certain since racist messages are everywhere in the us it would be very difficult to find a control group that hadnt been taught racist things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit eats up fresh copaganda like candy expect this one to be on a typical repost cycle like the breakdancers like the riot cop that jokes with the blm activist like the one saving the cat and whatever else
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,damn srs is woke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess that engineering degree does teach reddit how to dig the best hole to bury your head in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,since i am a muttminimum different breeds it really is confusing to me that people have a problem with race hell there are some great videos on youtube showing people get their genealogy test done that are fantastic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,itsinteresting my girls just about to turn and weve had to explain what racism is before explaining why its wrong of course its an incredibly delicate and nuanced subject and were talking to someone who lacks a fundamental understanding of what race is never mind discrimination based on race its kind of impossible to explain in a single go
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im stealing this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i didnt mean to gloss over what racism actually is how pervasive those messages are im sure i was still exposed to racism just in our white small town is just wasnt something that came up much irl edit oh and yeah sexism my dad is always like im not sexist i dont think women are inherently inferior or anything i just think men are better than women at most things also you need my permission to marry my property daughter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone at my church in high school said this to a black woman to her face she was so shocked that she asked him to repeat it thinking she must have misheard and he said it again i didnt say anything because me being white boy it made sense to me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like fenton or god damn bootleg fireworks

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,make it your flair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not yet but i want to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rabble rabble rabble businesses should have freedoms such as to discriminate in the hiring and service towards certain groups of people business doesnt stock a few books this is practically nazism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,choosing not to carry some books in your non governmentrun business is get out your notebooks you infantile little shits freedom of speech
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its ironic considering that it was the nazi government that burned books not a private entity and amazon is not selling books that advocate for the complete destruction of free speech in the name of the glorious aryan master racetm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if this thing was something else entirely wouldnt it be terrible really makes you think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i see a lot of folks in that thread saying that holocaust denialists should be debated ahem clears throat youre wrong you are really fucking wrong that isnt me saying that its everybody who has publically debated holocaust denialists in public discourse it just elevates the denialists gives them another platform to spread their shit and fills their wallets theres a reason that these debates dont happen anymore and that is because this issue was settled twenty years ago im not an expert on the holocaust and i dont claim to be one but when they unanimously say dont debate denialists im not too highlythinking of myself that i wont listen to them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we should never go back to that terrible time in any way oh the irony
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit on bookstores not selling nazi books reddit on christian bookstores second link is just one comment but the whole comment section is pretty much good we cant have this being propagated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy slippery slope batman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre about one or two steps away from saying what if the child consents tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah yes because no businesses with terrible and exploitative and sometimes downright abusive policies ever survive in actual marketplaces s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,american freedumb in action
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its a free market that also means that amazon can do whatever the fuck they want to isnt that what le libertarian redditeurs are so supportive of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that lack of awareness in the reply is massive folks call up fermilab weve found the missing dark matter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are worse things than burning books such as not reading them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every single person on earth not buying or selling holocaust denial books is literally a book burner who knew 😂
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on not selling holocaust denial and neonazi books why its a marketplace should amazon start vetting every single book for what is ok and what isnt banning books thats getting awfully close to burning books we should never go back to that terrible time in any way at utc atwalol replied to why its a marketplace should amazon start vetting every single book for what is ok and what isnt its not their responsibility
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors dont support freedom of speech just freedom of hate speech all other speech must bend at the knee to make sure hate speech goes uninterrupted unimpeded and unrestrained
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean a bookseller isnt keen on spreading the message of people who want to burn books thats completely illogical s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you replace the words in a sentence it takes on a different meaning ancient reddit proverb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if theres one thing ive learned from donald trump its that you cant reason racists out of their racism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its pointless to debate them because there is literally no standard of evidence that will satisfy them the only thing that happens is a lunatic conspiracy theorist gets to rant about bad evidence and impressionable people watching who dont understand the difference between conclusive evidence and absolute proof end up thinking that maybe the idiot has a point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit has this naive misconception that when presented with the facts everyone will immediately change their misinformedhateful opinions the ironic thing is that reddit is a pretty good example of why that isnt true selling holocaust denial books cant do anything but validate and popularize holocaust denialism i dont understand how anyone could possibly believe otherwise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit logic x is bad y is like x in some way therefore y is bad without caring about how the things that make x bad has nothing to do with y
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what line should amazon draw for banning books from its virtual shelves where it says this book only offends these groups so its ok but this group offends these groups so were going to remove it regardless of sales etc literally the greatest evil in the recorded history of mankind is a good place to start further some folks deserve to be offended offended an actual nazi good be proud of that it means you stand in opposition to what few values they have which are all evil and who should be making this decision for amazon ideally the consciences of those in charge but what effects their wallets will matter too nazis dont have value of honesty or decency so they dont see anything wrong with piracy so its not really financially viable to cater to them when it catches you some heat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol yeah the manifesto of the man who orchestrated the holocaust is merely just offensive to people like a gross bug or saying fuck in public and who should be making this decision for amazon amazon amazon makes it for amazon wtf even is that question did you expect me to say the deepstate lmfao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit and the weedbro libertarians who care about free speech only care because they want to be able to say offensive things and get away with it i dont think ive ever seen any of them stick up for a minoritys right to speak out like say blm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,different things are different apparently a mindblowing revelation for most redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you cant use reason to debate an unreasonable person it just doesnt happen that isnt to say that they cant change its just that you wont be able to do it with rational discourse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,true sometimes its not about swaying the ideals of who you are debating but trying to get this information to the audience viewing the debate to sway theirs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just words on paper or a screen lol yes just words obviously just words and nothing else words on paper do nothing thats why contracts are all unenforceable and when an order is signed by the president nothing happens because words on paper dont matter if you people honestly believed that then there wouldnt be so much push back when private entities dont want to associate with the material clearly its not just words to you and im sick of you fucks using that disingenuous defense when the vile nature of the material is called out like people have used for all sorts of other books that we liberals cant live without lel dat false equivalence obviously conservatives whining about harry potter and liberals being concerned about mein kampf are le same what word would you use dangerous sure so liberal of you to run to the defense of mein kampf btw fucking lmfao amazon is an organization of nearly people all of them are going to make that decision for fucks sake i dont know why im bothering with someone being intentionally obtuse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you dont sway audience members with facts you sway audience members with presentation public debates arent small secluded areas of rational discourse theyre boxing arenas for bookworms you have two people duking it out while onlookers cheer for the person whose personality they like the most
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,amazon is an organization of nearly people all of them are going to make that decision do they not know how companies work

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we have a serious issue that we cant talk about because people are too fucking fragile youre talking about it right now people have blared the selfsame shit you have at every single opportunity literally every time a suspect is a minority the reason people are treating you as racist is because a terrible tragedy happens and you assholes feel the need to use it as an excuse to bring up the tired but what about x culture cant we talk about how its x thing i dislike while you fail to understand that every culture has shit elements including your own also good job shitting on people for not being le empathyless starkly logical redditurd how dare people be bothered by your racist whataboutism if you arent thankful trump is president you will soon thats the kind of thing my neonazi uncle would say and then be surprised when i laugh its funny how convinced they are that it will be great and it likely will for them while completely ignoring how shitty its going to be for literally everyone else
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck everything im a student here at osu we had a uptick of hate crimes against poc and muslims after the election and im afraid that that uptick will now turn pedaltothemetal i was locked in a dark classroom for an hour and a half today fearing for my life im not going to be fucking afraid of a fellow buckeye in a hijab
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre quoting orwell in the child comments ay yi yi

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of the students ive talked to in ohio have said that theres been upticks and ive personally seen it at my school its a load of garbage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,after the election some white supremacist posters were hung in the student lounge for my major at osu and i have heard they were across campus as well its fucking disgusting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae getting banned from a platform for being a racist shitstain means that the people you are being racist against run the platform
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,twitter has been banning many people promoting this petition watch out saudi based twitter has been imposing the twisharialaw ban hammer at utc salafiabortion replied to twitter has been banning many people promoting this petition watch out saudi based twitter has been imposing the twisharialaw ban hammer not a surprise since twitter has a good portion owned by saudi wahhabis imposing their restrictions of free speech i know most of my accounts get shadow banned and theyre always critical of the saudis and qataris

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,caring about things is bad and youre uncool for doing so a guide to web activism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people care about white australians this is gonna sound classist and i dont mean it to be but are we sure these people are trustworthy theyre descended from criminals after all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and its hardly like this is going to be a top headline i cant even find another australian news outlet who cares now it comes and goes like a fart in a gale without even getting a screening edit the herald sun has a minor opinion piece about it but thats a murdochowned tabloid it doesnt really count as news

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kinda like the sarkeesian effect movie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just adding this for factual sake only a small number of immigrants were criminals and only colonies were penal most of australias immigration took place in the
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that was a massive scam it still makes me lol how it even raised any money at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well yeah but i have to give white australians shit union thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes but the new immigrants mated with the penal descendants so they would have some descent from criminals in the penal colonies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what did he spend it on anyway fifty thousand skulls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,plastic surgery to look like a literal dickhead

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dear redditeur you are a sack of dog shit sincerely everyone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pedophile culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ray romano at a golf tournament the att at pebble i think made a remark on camera about not wanting to go home because his wife was there later he excused himself by saying it was just a joke this is what they all think that these things are just jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that whole thread is awful not only do they gild his comment but they go on to post his past comments about his wife as if hes some kind of hero
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i refuse to believe that this cheetolord somehow found someone that didnt think he was a sack of dog shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lady run
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,torn between wanting the wife to find that comment and leaving him for someone who actually will say nice things about her and hoping she never knows what a horrible thing this man has said behind her back what a heartbreaking comment that would be to find edit apparently all his comments are like that hopefully hes literally like a year old
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow your wife lucked out when she married such a kind and empathic man like yous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you are a sack of dog shit anonymous redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,never can tell with those latino girls i dated one and freaked when told me she was only looked all day long ugh this thread is a sack of dog shit

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate when they talk about human beings like some weird prehistoric creatures like this like holy cow we are a little more advanced than basic rules of nature by this point people like this also tend to toss around words like mate and value and shit we are people you weird dullard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nice butts is a trait that men have um source please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when i got married a coworker of mine said the best part about being married is all the great jokes you get to make i have literally never found humor in the old ball and chain or cracking wise about my wife spending money or something besides it being hacky and unfunny its gross and offensive and sexist and makes you seem like a dumb and awful person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they dont have wives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a lot of the positive response to this joke is from the troll mentality not everyone is laughing at the offensive joke but rather at the people who they know will be offended by it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its because the safest most basic form of humor men have been joking about their wives for literally thousands of years literally the ancient sumerians told fart jokes about wives sitting on their laps its one of if not the oldest joke weve ever discovered a wife joke is a sure way to win the crowd and anybody at your local bar not saying i enjoy them they are old and worn out im just stating as to why i think they are so popular
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its about ethics in being a dangerous creep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy male sexuality s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a novelty account but its still ridiculous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to redditors hating women is a heroic act
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the internet chances of him lying for karma especially when hes being a pedoy weirdo are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think ive missed the reference on this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant imagine ever marrying someone i felt such a huge amount of resentment for like maybe if you feel the need to treat your wife like shes a piece of shit thats holding you back you shouldnt be married but its obviously gay people ruining the sanctity of marriage s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same but apparently theyre the normal ones lmao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have you not seen a dude with a nice ass
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,besides it being hacky and unfunny its gross and offensive and sexist and makes you seem like a dumb and awful person its starting to make sense that reddit has greeted this guy as a hero
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the same for damn got to look after the kids joaks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just think its boring and dumb its like it wasnt even funny when al bundy did it years ago these people have such vivid imaginations for a group of people who cant seem to figure out humor the whole le triggering thing has turned into this sprawling mythology with all kinds of recurring archetypes the free market of ideas or whatever really is a complete pile of useless shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bingo came here as soon as i saw the comment was not disappointed keep it classy boys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just satire bro
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can you imagine a novelty account that was a woman making comments like that about an imaginary husband it would be the most hated novelty on reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a gross and unfunny novelty account
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im guessing it has to do with the fact that ducks and dolphins reproduce a lot mostly through rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trust me i have but its weird to point that out as a trait men have evolved to their advantage over women and id like to know if there was any scientific basis behind the statement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they already complain about the dumb husband trope in ads but when feminists criticize the portrayal of women theyre just making shit up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its srs counterculture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i kind of wish i hadnt learned that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought it was ducks that have corkscrewed vaginas specifically to prevent rape and so she gets a say in whom she wants to mate for life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would be extremely skeptical even from a primal place which is where this argument originates a nice butt is wayyyy less important than say a talented hunter or fisher or smith or whatever else this aesthetic obsession is relatively new for people outside the highest classes not to mention evolution doesnt much matter in humans currently we dont select our partners because of their amazing reflexes or nice ass at least i didnt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well simple logic would suffice no women like nice asses men work out to get nice asses bam
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,using fancy words lolwat your solipsistic views on comedy lol what am i judith butler the rest of you understand what im saying right if this is what you got out of what i said then we might need to go back to go dog go or some shit triggering isnt a new concept no its a term used to refer to shit that causes ptsd victims distress its mostly spoiled children and their technicallyadult counterparts that think ptsd is funny to poke fun at something dates back long before online anonymity removed any downside of agitate humor no way the free market of opinions really disagrees with you the free market of anything ever is dogshit just saying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not that theyre making shit up its that they complain about it more than males complain about the dumb husband trope
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,then you will be happy to know that the rituals surrounding dolphin sex are not as tender as human sex but they
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont ask about ducks and at least that will help
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes that developed as a response to constant rape from male ducks iirc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you these comments were just weird in general
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe because negative representations of women are much more common than those of men dickhead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hrm there were some really good points in that article but i fail to see how surrounding a female and not letting her hunt go home play whatever until she sleeps with one or more of them isnt at least coercion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the corckscrew boogaloo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought of that too when i read it whats significant is that the author and the interviewee take care not to anthropomorphize their behavior dolphin mating rituals arise from dolphin cognition so to apply human emotion to cognition that isnt human isnt congruent with the inquiry being made
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre soft like a piece of shit cause your a poopyhead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but kaepernick is implying that the country is racist which it isnt the president is fucking black an actual comment in that thread i shouldnt be surprised that redditors are this stupid and ignorant but here i am surprised that someone typed this out looked at it thought yes this makes complete sense and posted it incredible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but men are oppressed because women are allowed to accuse us of rape amirite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but kaepernick is implying that the country is racist which it isnt the president is fucking black lmfao ive always thought thats a le strawman but here it is in the wild someone said to himself hey this is an argument that i should make and its a good argument
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a big fan and was really glad to hear kap say this the rnfl thread was overall less bad than i feared going in mostly people just pulling their collars awkwardly going oh boy what a controversial thing to say am i right but of course there were bound to be some shit like this upvoted too pro tip if youre white youre really not in any position to say racism isnt a big deal same goes with any other oppression itd be like a millionaire saying oh yeah being poor is soooo hard im pretty sure poor people are legally allowed to have jobs right so what are you whining about theres nothing thats harder about being poor nothing that i notice anyways equally ridiculous reddit is generally more critical of greedy rich people like that shkrelli guy but when it comes to race since most people on that sub and reddit in general are white they dont know what theyre talking about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how long ago did redlining officially stop maybe to years ago and thats not including being done unofficially well into the and even today how about discrimination in voting oh we just had the gop going after black voters in nc last year and this year racism in government oh the maine governor said black and hispanics should be shot because they are more likely to be caught selling drugs and yet you would be hard pressed to find someone in a majority white area who doesnt know the local white drug dealer oh a black mayor won over a temporarily appointed white lady and she called her a n on facebook how many times has the president be considered a muslim a monkey including his the first lady a liar and unamerican simply because he is black trump retwitting storm front memes yeah racism is dead edit autocorrections
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,facebook convo with family friend cop of years who has never witnessed racism his point of view is ignorant scary
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unarmed black people being shot at a rate six times that of whites is just black culturestm fault why cant they be more white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive always been pretty neutral towards kaep but i gained a lot of respect for him after this unsurprisingly friends on facebook dont share the same feeling
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thankfully that comment got downvoted a bit and the comments below it are calling him out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whew im so glad that kaep has the privilege to destroy his body and turn his brain into mush all for a nonguaranteed contract not to mention helping make his college make all that money anyway fuck the niners on account of the techbro stadium that wasted unfathomable amount of money being built but big ups on kaep throwing in on this blm can be ignored since it isnt something that can be fucked or sold but athletes can be sold and this is a hell of a wedge to keep the door open for the whole black people should be treated like humans discussion thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats hilarious about this is the whole i hate the way everything is now so pc crowd is up in arms about this selfreflection
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow it seems like most of those cishet sports guys actually called that shit out and didnt stand for it i would have never expected that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,still has a more likely chance of being shot by a police officer there have been cases where rich black people are shot where a white person wouldnt have been the president is black but parts of the senate tried to discredit him with born in kenya and secretly a muslim
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,colin kaeperknick has made millions of dollars off his own talent all the usa did was provide him with an exploitative frame work in which to make his money in which he still doesnt earn a fraction of what people at the top do its mind boggling that this has to be explained but here we are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank goodness rnfl wasnt putting up with that shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah yes as long as youre nominally permitted to do something that means theres cant be any obstruction or coercion preventing you from doing it social influence never stops anyone from doing anything duh s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some restrictions apply
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,poor black people why dont you just play in the nfl its so simple
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sometimes i feel like reddit is just a test to see who shouldnt be allowed to vote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes colin the black men and women of this country are so oppressed cant vote own property get an education or hey play professional football for millions of dollars at utc replied to yes colin the black men and women of this country are so oppressed cant vote own property get an education or hey play professional football for millions of dollars
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nobody ever talks about the fryer houston study i dont really understand why because its probably one of the most important race studies done in a while basic point is that previous white with offenders are more likely to be shot compared to their black counterpart blacks however are more like to beaten or tazed than their white counterpart honestly im not entirely sure what to do with this information but it does suggest some extremely interesting ideas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can we honestly expect well thought out political opinions to come from rnfl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,racism is over because theres a black president meanwhile thousands of white men being presidents congressmen and governors and white men are still the most oppressed group
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so by his logic as soon as barrys second term is up america becomes racist again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the ultimate as a black man if you really think about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i accused a man of rape and videogames are banned forever now makes u think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant be racist i have a black friend president
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pro tip if youre white youre really not in any position to say racism isnt a big deal same goes with any other oppression running with that notion ive always found the youre too easily offended response to be strange let me get this right a straight white dude is telling a non white gay andor woman to not be offended thats like kicking someone in the proverbial balls and telling their target theyre too easily offended and shouldnt be upset why is the person demographic throwing the punches and holding a foot on anothers neck think its perfectly fine to dictate their victims response
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they actually like shkreli now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if youre white youre really not in any position to say racism isnt a big deal but how something be a big deal if it doesnt personally affect me anyway now allow me to explain to you how ethics in games journalism and people who are against racism are somehow the downfall of society
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now if only he could go back to form
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its way downvoted now and most of the comments on this topic in multiple subs seemed to be relatively levelheaded compared to defaults
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and now those redlined districts are getting gentrified
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,very very seriously fuck the police
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,average cops facebook feed from around here too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i used to hate him because im a packers fan but ive gained a lot of respect for him after this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes by rnfl readers to boot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nobody ever talks about the fryer houston study there is also as you know one study isnt much scientifically speaking especially if the findings are disputed in other studies its a beginning and not conclusive yet thats why it is rather pointless to talk about it in the meantime people are being shot and killed should people wait until things are conclusive to act either way you slice it excessive use of force is not acceptable and police should be held accountable for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those whites were also more likely to be actively shooting at and trying to kill officers hell the numbers even play it out that whites try to kill cops more than any other group yet blm and black people get all the hate for people trying to kill cops also from what i can remember his study only accounts for major cities in states police shootings happens all over the country
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,our nations capital continues to be represented by an offensive slur and they defend it with more vigor than reddit on the fappening tried so many times to explain the problem but i am shouted down immediately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought racism was over when mlk was born and taught the uppity blacks™ to sit down nicely and listen to massa obey the laws
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe but at least sexism will be over since well prob have a womz president cant wait
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i long for brdtopia where we accuse men of vidya and rape is b
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre too easily offended why not just ignore the things that bother you say the people who have never actually experienced any kind of widespread oppression or abuse and yet feel themselves fully qualified to tell people how they should feel about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,really just when i think the bar cant get any lower
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know what definition of they youre using but seems to be a fringe minority who just want to be seen as knowing the truth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kill the heretic bears fan here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats sort of the point of the study it was to shoe that excessive force is happening but people dismiss any studies that dont follow their preconceived beliefs and wont even discuss them must alllll be related to race right i completely agree that there are numerous studies in the area but this one in particular was one of the biggest of its kind with information that normally isnt public
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes you are absolutely correct there is numerous issues with the study i fully agree and anyone who doesnt either hasnt read it or dropped out after elementary school another issue is that it was only for previously arrested people but still this is one of the biggest studies of its kind and people like to dismiss it because it doesnt fall in line with their beliefs thats the entire point i am making its never brought up and most of the time people just have random opinions based on their own fallacies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no no texas just updated the text books racism ended when the kindly white man offered jobs and housing and free travel to the economic migrants of africa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or if heavens forbid trump wins then the oompaloompas will be freed from their capitalist slavemaster
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,check out his twitter or dont if you dont want to contract eye cancer hes trying so hard to be an altright icon and to get noticed by milosenpai its a bunch of reactionary edge because he styles himself as a troll or we
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess all that wallstreetbets fame has gotten to his head and hes made the leap from irl troll to twitter roll
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i see i misunderstood what you were saying my apologies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because hell be too busy being president
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre right but im
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do tell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would literally not believe that academic erasure this blatant was happening if i werent staring right at it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,millions of workers christ and people complain about being pc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was like a year ago very upsetting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the south also has massively represented white people in power most politicians business owners etc are all white conservtaives its usually the people in charge who cause problems apparently a near white gop government is irrelevant but too many poor black people are the problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the south is also the black belt it has of americas african american population gee i wonder why that is was there something that happened in the south historically i mean theyre trump supporters so they probably dont realize that the places with large african american populations also just happened to be slave states hey can anyone remind me what happened when those slave states were told they could no longer own a human being or what they did for the next years after that or why they keep outing kkk members on police forces from the south white people a race best known for never taking responsibility for their actions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit once again proving itself an oasis of nuanced and intelligent treatment of valuable discussion topics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whole comment chain nuked the skeleton cabal successfully thaws more peaches
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol yes its not because of the souths history of white supremacy or anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the guys on the comment section beeing like member fph lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for an ideology based on socalled personal responsibility its truly staggering how far conservatives will bend the facts to avoid attributing even one drop of blame to themselves for anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some great valuable conversation here at reddit dot com the front page of the internet thanks uspez for this great contribution to mankind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i see people spout off ridiculous hateful shit like this every single day even when im not looking for it and my simple question can never be answered why why does preserving the white race matter even though race is a social construct why do white people have any claim over north america even though they didnt integrate with the existing population why do jewish people have a secret conspiracy to control all media and money and whats their end goal anyway what do the jewish people have to do with gayness why is being gay immoral why would the media try to influence an increase in queerness and to what end why does it matter if people behave in a way normally associated with another gender if gender roles are artificial why is iq the only measure of a persons worth but of course these tiny little goofballs arent capable of answering these questions if you keep asking okay but why eventually theyll explode because all their beliefs are irrational and fearbased
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the most disgusting phrase in this quote is get their cummies also all the slurs too i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey uspez hope you like reddit being a base of operations for literal nazis you fucking moron
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit a safe space against safe spaces reddit where fat angry white men complain about how fat angry black women need to get their shit together reddit where the united states of america is more diverse than entire continents reddit where the privileges of the first world are never enough reddit where america gathers to laugh at the world reddit where homophobic white men jerk each other off because thats what real men do reddit where people discuss how the fact that i am a genetically inferior human being makes them the victim
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am sure if you headed over to stormfront they would be happy to answer all your questions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that doesnt stop the modern liberal movement from imposing traditional values on things like the gaming industry the poor gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dudes have low cut shirts already theyre called v necks that comic is bad and they should feel bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,full matriarchy when
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rfunny no wonder rmeirl became all memes and shitposts its all the poor users who wanted actually humorous content
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why is it that when men think of equality between the sexes the first thing that comes to mind is either something to do with public nudity or the right to hit women it scares me honestly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,teh fummynazhees want an evil social justice infested matriarchy where people who constantly sprout offensive slurs will be ostracised
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i actually kinda liked the comic then reddit has to immediately turn it into an argument about feminism like jfc it feels like this gets done in every thread in default subs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,slurs wear shirts so whyyyyyyyy cant the poor oppressed man walk around showing his pubic hair with his zipper half way undone basically the same exact thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh look law showed up to squeeze out a deuce on the turdpile too feminism is advocacy for women like oil lobbyists are advocates for the oil industry ask yourself do oil lobbyists want equal treatment for oil solar natural gas wind ethanol etc or do they want the people paying them to get the best deal possible now that our feminist lobbying scheme has been found out will i stop receiving my monthly checks from the womz this white enamel on my plate mail aint gonna keep itself shiny if i cant buy cuckshine brand armor polish
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think feminists want this much equality though youre right they dont want any in reply to thatsmyhoverboard on i dont think feminists want this much equality though at utc pelikahn wrote youre right they dont want any httpiimgurcombyffamnpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its very telling that redditors always use the word equality as an insult or a threat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if anyone wants an invite to imzy i have also i want a shirt soooo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whys this on here theyre right i literally want to kill all men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think feminists want this much equality though i dont understand what feminism means youre right they dont want any me neither
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,traditional values like not making every protagonist a straight white male gruff mcsoldierpants
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but also feminists keep shoving progressive politics down gamers throats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,smoking and eating chocolates while playing cards never have i seen such debauchery
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how these are all presented as like the worst thing ever men raising kids insanity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny how for men being treated like they treat women constitutes an unspeakable cruelty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course they portray it as men doing everything as if sharing the burden is doing everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that would require knowing about a piece of clothing thats in style cargo shorts and graphic tees ahoy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,didnt you know that the vneck is part of an evil feminist plot to emasculate men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it already happened these poor saps just havent realized it yet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,careful with those public announcements my community got two trolls since spamming slurs isnt real trolling within hours of my adding the community to uranchounicornos list in the daily chat thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you still doing this id love to find a better place to hang out in than reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only thing they deserve is to be put on the moon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they targeted gamers gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because gamers literally cant tell the difference between allowing a woman to be depicted as sexually open and sexualizing them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh they know about v necks they think that theyre another sign that a man is a beta cuck this is not a lie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but i was promised gulags
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even funnier because they completely ignored how many women either celebrated that women can be drafted or showed the opposition to drafting in general for men and women by women as proof that feminists dont want equality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a private inviteonly reddit replacement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pm me your emailwell an email address
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i got one out of nowhere months after i signed up youll probably get it eventually
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah pm me an email address and ill send an invite your way

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,first they came for the gamers but i did not speak out because i was not a gamer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,first they came for the racists but i did not speak because i was not openly racist then they came for the homophobes but i did not speak because i was not openly homophobic then they came for the sexists but there was no one left to speak for me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,guylags

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought you didnt speak out because they were already dead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok foucalt easy there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah thats what i mean they ignored that the opposition to the draft is opposing anyone being drafted and portrayed it as women just not wanting women to be drafted and proof that feminists hate equality ugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder if somebody already produced a latin translation of this if not i may have to do it—with others help
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i didnt speak out because gamer culture is toxic and disgusting i like my vidya but i stay away from the culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sure you could find one if you browse the history or linguistics subreddits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i found presumably its good but i cant say for sure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its been a while since i saw the religious people r dumb sentiment outside of an edgelord sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on a jewish custom and the stupidity is lost on them an omnipotent god just missing their obvious breaking of its supposed rules i didnt see anything i was helping flies hatch out of african babies eyes no foul logic and religion dont really go hand in hand in reply to whitcwa on its called an httpsenwikipediaorgwikieruv the eruv allows those religious jews to carry among other things house keys tissues medication or babies with them and to use strollers and canes its literally a giant loophole i hope god has a sense of humor at utc wrote and the stupidity is lost on them an omnipotent god just missing their obvious breaking of its supposed rules i didnt see anything i was helping flies hatch out of african babies eyes no foul
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just saw it on srs lol edit not a concern troll i love this sub but that thread seemed like oldschool rathiesm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre not wrong maybe im more tilted because i grew up in a super religious home and ive seen what the guilt of the bible can do to people but we cant just complain about any religion bashing some of my extremely christian family members are the most hateful people ive ever met and theyre that way because they use the bible as a way to judge the world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a world of difference between ratheism and that thread you linked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill take tone argument and shes a shrill harpy for alex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can complain about societal oppression but do it in a way that i can easily ignore if i think youre being uppity ill side with the reactionaries against you love me im a liberal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and yet theyll defend gamergaters who a are so whiny and annoying no one can fucking stand and b dont have a valid point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they targeted gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but hey at least they admit our grievances are valid so thats a step in the right direction
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ff is just a bunch of bad con artists trying to remain relevant for money i wouldnt be surprised if more than half their revenue came from people who watch their videos to disagree with their points can women in gaming be treated better i doubt theres anyone who would say no but i dont know many people that are knowledgable about the topics that takes ff seriously there was even that feminist talk show host who lambasted them christina hoff sommers is not a feminist talk show host and omg just this whole comment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok i read the comment thread and im honestly just confused theres comment after comment saying like i dont hate ff but they take things too far and are too polarizing and similar bullshit and i just dont get it ive watched the videos amd theyre all presented in a way that doesnt blame any individuals or target anyone specifically they contain some entrylevel feminism and theyre spoken in a very calm way i dont even understand how someone can be so sensitive that they take gentle criticism of something they like to be this polarizing personal attack and how so many people do this i am experiencing one of the rare times in my life where i just cannot understand another person and i really dont get it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in all fairness nicks joke wasnt probably the most immediate issue that femfreq couldve made a statement about i mean yes krystal is a character whose agency is taken away and is positioned as a sex appeal character but as far as misogyny in games go this hot take seems absolutely nitpicky compared to commentary on any other figure in gaming although femfreq probably criticized nick instead of anybody significantly more deserving because nick and polygon are much friendlier to them and anita politically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wed be happy to have more women in the workplace as long as theyre hot these types of people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who gives a shit if you dont like their tone if they have valid points they ought to be addressed this shitty tone argument is just an easy excuse to watch and listen to le rational gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the thing with these feminist twitters or what have you they absolutely have valid complaints but they do it in such an accusatory and irritating manner that nobody can fucking stand them in reply to bugsbunnyindrag on probably because theyre tired of male gamers constantly dominating video game talk with references to what does and doesnt please their penises this is like a welldocumented issue with the gaming community until the past few years at utc wrote this is the thing with these feminist twitters or what have you they absolutely have valid complaints but they do it in such an accusatory and irritating manner that nobody can fucking stand them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait i thought people were too sensitive these days and that le freedom of speech trumps common courtesy oh i get it its ok to harass someone in order to try to get them to kill themselves but its not ok to complain too loudly that youre being harassed got it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god sarkeesian isnt even correct about this one either nick robinson and polygon are one of the best most inclusive gaming sites on the internet if not the best but i do understand where she was coming from but god forbid she makes a complaint about a tweet she misunderstood god forbid she jump to that conclusion in a culture that consistently abuses women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,harpies get shit done
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youll take youll take like fuck you will woman get back in place and beg for me to give n i c e g u ybecause white men eg me are so benevolentn i c e g u y s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont have a valid point actually its about ethics in gaming journalism s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gamers were a group of people who will sit for hours days even weeks on end performing some of the hardest most mentally demanding tasks over and over and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did well punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture because we think its fun well spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second many of us have made careers out of doing just these things slogging through the grind all day the same quests over and over hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed systems over heated disks and carts destroyed frustration all to latter be referred to as bragging rights these people honestly think this is a battle they can win they take our media were already building a new one without them they take our devs gamers arent shy about throwing their money else where or even making the games our selves they think calling us racist mysoginistic rape apologists is going to change us weve been called worse things by prepubescent year olds with a shitty head set they picked a fight against a group thats already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods who enjoy the battle of attrition theyve threatened us with who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter our obsession with proving we can after being told we cant is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brotherssisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need a honed reflex gamers are competative hard core by nature we love a challange the worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us youre not special youre not original youre not the first this is just another boss fight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,christina hoff sommers isnt even a feminist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously i got into it because i had heard it was some firespitting radical tearing apart the ugly base of video game narratives instead its like listening to my mom talk about movies where is the blood
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tweet tweet motherclucker brd harpy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure manufacturing consent applies to entertainment journalism too but gg attacked the one person anita sarkeesian who was the least corrupt her crowdfunding made her relatively independent of the developers and she openly criticized them two things gg claims to want but her being a woman outweighed all of that to them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean there are a lot of legitimate complains that can be had against videogame journalism at this point i think gamergate was conjured up by the industry to keep people from looking into the actual ethical problems with the industry by attacking the very kinds of people who would put up with the corruption less ie ladies and social justiceyleftleaning types in general
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know shes an mra pretending to be a feminist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well it was some gamergator rant now its delicious copypasta
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a famous copypasta that was originally from rkotakuinaction its pretty great imo shows how these rational redditors see themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder if we could get anyone to do the reverse to undo the damage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao sounds fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think that would amount to saying feminist stuff but adding slurs so nobody notices
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like me about four years ago when i was still learnin the basics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well at least we found something that can convince white europeans to procreate at utc girodidante replied to well at least we found something that can convince white europeans to procreate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white boys are outraged at everything hearing any of them calling things fake outrage is hilarious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look out people the de facto authority on outrage legitimacy is here to set the record straight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shouldnt these people be leaping at the opportunity to call people who arent white racists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i find it hilarious that the american majority of reddit will non stop judge and criticize muslims countries for their cultural practices but when people point out china can be very racist towards black people they demand we leave them alone and we cant possibly understand their cultural constructs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow this dude has the answer for everything doesnt he
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this about the doggos again yes we all know the chinese eat dogs in a certain celebration in a certain area the problem isnt with the eating of the dogs it is the preparation of the food which involves virtually torturing the animals there are some things that people can unanimously agree are wrong it was the same thing with the bearbile farms in china theres nothing objectively wrong about harvesting bear bile as you can easily breed and farm bears and humane harvesting techniques exist its just that some organizations would use inhumane fatal techniques to get the bile resulting in great suffering its not like chinsese people turn a blind eye to it either its just that in a nation of billions the actions of a few are diluted edit grammar
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is asking yourself questions a trite rhetorical device yes does it make me look silly of course will i continue to do it because i want to feel like a man who has all the answers you better believe it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like i dont even think there is any significant population outraged at the commercial i think it probably just got a bunch of wow thats really racist not omgomgomgogmg thats so racist im guessing the pc crowd isnt the outraged party here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not even a fact of racismin the end western culture is looking at the world saying we wouldnt do that so why would you and its stupid is the commercial morally questionable by us standards yes chinese standards no is it fake outrage yes in reply to on the black guy from the chinese laundry detergent why is everyone so flabbergasted over this commercial but commercials like these are socially justifiable httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdntfodcbo racism exists for every nationality and shouldnt be under subjugation of one ethnic group if you want everyone to be perceived as equals then you should yourself defend every nationality from bigotry equally of course some ethnic groups are more more underrepresented than other but bridging inequality by justifying discrimination of another race only leads to more segregation and not unity both these commercials should be put at equal disdain at utc xanza wrote its not even a fact of racism or a fact of two entirely different cultures in the end western culture is looking at the world saying we wouldnt do that so why would you and its stupid is the commercial morally questionable by us standards yes chinese standards no is it fake outrage yes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nothing faker than white culture

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are people so upset about a commercial for a product saying their skin color is unclean why would anyone be upset by that i mean we call all just change colors whenever we want right fellow reptilians
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this about the doggos again no its about a commercial in china where theres a black person in the commercial who is thrown into a washing machine to cleanse the black off of him and he emerged a chinese person which is as best a racist commercial saying black skin is not good looking because its not chinese at worst a metaphor for ethnic cleansing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the problem isnt with the eating of the dogs it is the preparation of the food which involves virtually torturing the animals lol you think factory farms are better and no its not wrong whats wrong is giving puppies special attention when animals higher on the conscious awareness hierarchy are treated as food pigs thats completely whimsical and a sign of cultural intolerance
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is funny whomever downvoted you is a reptillian
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this point is there any white culture besides getting outraged at other cultures and then trying to steal from them

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on rthedonald where else within the post is a comic purporting to show different reactions to white and nonwhite refugees from the left the comic is clearly bullshit for a number of reasons which im sure i dont have to outline it ends by claiming that diversity is about getting rid of whites a wellknown white nationalist slogan the capitalisation of whites is also straight out of the stormfront playbook in the comments more shit from the man with the very subtle username that post is followed by one that restates the white nationalist slogan from the comic saying before launching into some nonsense rhetoric about how orwellian the left are in his mind throwing antisemitism into the stew of hate that is this thread another wellknown white nationalist talking point is trotted out i could probably link almost every comment in the thread to be honest but thatll do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it actually starts out promising with an article saying we need to actually treat this as rape and not just sex and then quickly devolves into people defending the rapists saying the victims want it saying that statutory rape shouldnt exist even a im going to get downvoted but making sure we know that its actually about ephebipitybopophilia

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres been some persuasive disinformation spread about how sweden is now a third world hell hole where muslins are throwing grenades all the time and no one can do anything about it its a lot like that time the us was overrun with satanic childrape cults
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is what happens when you live a sheltered life and think with your penis there is a vast difference between fantasy and reality and people need to realize that btw please i need you now more than ever uhm was this sentence meant for me

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quite a bit actually i was just in seattle the other week for the international was a great experience
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so everybodys always caught up in the drama is what youre saying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a shame maybe the next new genre will be more interesting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is a huge crazy possibility i dont think that means what le reddituer thinks it means
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah dude you sound like youve interacted with thousands of women totally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spermjacking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that whole thread is a shitfest as well as the orginial meme demands divorce out of nowhere just lmao glad we know eerything about their brakeup time to circlejerk about scary women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one last sex who the fuck talks like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tell me again why these dudes are so interested in having sex with women when there is clearly such an enormous risk to them of spermjacking rape accusations and child support trapping
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good thing the local spermjacking expert browses redditcom or we never would have gotten this life pro tip tm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in a way im glad of the existence these insane talking points about scary females being out to get men hopefully means fewer mysoginists will reproduce because they will all be inexplicably terrified of evil mysandry babies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not having sex with a spouse youre divorcing is sensible advice but the reasoning here is absurd besides im pretty sure the state automatically declares the husband as the father if the pregnancy happened while the marriage was still technically ongoing no matter what the wife says
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,paternity test proof psh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lpt youre already going to divorce her so do not do that one last sex before the divorce because there is a huge crazy possibility that she will purposely get pregnant with another guy behind your back and tell court shes pregnant with your baby at utc knightingale replied to lpt youre already going to divorce her so do not do that one last sex before the divorce because there is a huge crazy possibility that she will purposely get pregnant with another guy behind your back and tell court shes pregnant with your baby
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every person ive met who referred to an ex as crazy has had serious personality flaws
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fluids
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok stop me if this sounds ridiculous but heres an idea if your afraid that a person intends to deceive and take advantage of you in such a serious way why are you still trusting them enough to have sex with them actually never kind that means you dont get to have sex wouldnt that be a tragedy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this stuff has to be a joke it has to be theres no other way im just scared that its serious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck white people at utc reaglebegal replied to fuck white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i sexually identify as an unoriginal joke ever since i was a boy i dreamed of surfing reddit dropping shitposts and derailing actual conversation people say to me that this has been really going on for far too long and and it trivialises gender identity but i dont care im a massive asshole im having a plastic surgeon install a mountain dew dispenser a catheter and and a poop shoot on my body from now on i want you guys to call me logical gamer and respect my right to freeze peach if you cant accept me youre a god damn tumblirina sjw cultural marxist liberal and you triggered lol thank you for being so understanding
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,adding glitter to a shitty joke will not improve your shitty joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they went out of their way to spice up this joak and yet it still mistakes sexuality for gender identity oh id forgotten—its totally about otherkin never mind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do these people always say i sexually identify as when they make these jokes it sounds awkward and just shows how uninformed they are reminds me of when folks say transgendered like being trans is just some life event that smacks you in the face welp i got transgendered yesterday guess this is my life now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sigh these thunderblunces will be sitting in their nursing homes at age ninety chuckling to themselves as they recount thisjokehalf a century from now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no looks like srs is doing that thing where srs downvote brigades itself whoopsies when you brigade as much as srs does its bound to happen sometimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so i just checked out the context of this and it literally has absolutely zero relevance to anything the parent comment did anyone else get hard and somewhat painful nipples how the fuck does this joke come out of that question
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and i sexually identify as someone who is really really fucking tired of this socalled joak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,today on reddit i either get to be a joke or a fetish i guess thats the same as every other day though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre an insult to comedy i wish lewis black would kick you in the nuts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is this specifically in response to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh who even finds this funny anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,original
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,joaks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nsfw thread i sexually identify as a general dynamics fighting falcon in reply to mpmmuirhead on did anyone else get hard and somewhat painful nipples at utc wrote male or female i wouldnt know i sexually identify as a general dynamics fighting falcon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i sexually identify as a ungroomed man child who dreams of being loved my hobbies include making fun of people who dont view the world as i do and posting unoriginal comments on the internet i usually spend my days on reddit making unoriginal jokes collecting upvotes that wont help me in any way im a nice guy but girls dont want to be with me i think that i actually identify more with the average redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just shows how uninformed they are i think you already have your answer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because that is the formula of the joke and if you dont properly reproduce the formula how will other redditers know to laugh and upvote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now im imagining that last part like the grand theft auto wasted screen but with transgendered as the character collapses in slowmo blackandwhite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i still dont understand how people get the word transgendered maybe because my english is shitty but i cant find a way to realize how does someone come up with it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh god reddit is getting to me i read chuckling as cucking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey guys remember that time when pete was doing the attack helicopter joke but then he said he identified as an instead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least when theyre in a nursing home theyll be the old and mostly harmless kind of bigot wait shit i forgot when theyre most old people will know how to use the internet

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love it except the ablest insult there it insults the mentally handicapped to include these assholes in their number
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,asking if some weird habit is done by men and women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,controversy dagger on the bot but srs is the real brigade amirite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jokes are how bigotry becomes normal think of the casual use of things like he gypped me or no father hes black reinforcing negative stereotypes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me i just despise the douchiness that has infested peoples attitudes encapsulated with this meme
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one actually laughs they are devoid of humor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre giving them too much credit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly thats how the dysphoria feels some days
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,probably the same way we go about describing something as gendered meaning divided or limited in some way by relation to one or more genders by particular elements of an object or the object as a whole i can see how the term transgendered might share similar etymology there in the sense of someone who has gone from one gender category to a different one we can describe people and animals in general as genderedgiven that it doesnt seem like much of a leap to then be more precise in that particular usage and in the same way refer to someone as transgendered personally i use transgender but thats just because its whats been indicated to me as being preferable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i chuckle while i cuckhold
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,found the beta

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tfw theres another baryonyx on this sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,by the time theyre reddit will have been long dead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ha high five
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every single time its the same few things where men have piled up enough snare words to make it look like they have anything to say false rape accusations child custody and child support are one of many areas of society where men have given themselves a raw deal by depersonalizing women but they still cant understand how this and its perpetuation remains their own witless fault edit to clarify not saying any of those is what theyre made out to be theyre only problemsand only exist in that theyre quasimythical bogeymen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was banned from there when i asked if discussing the harm the duluth model has done to abused men would go against their never question feminism policy i guess thats the answer supporting feminism trumps any consideration for male victims in reply to on sorry but rmenslib is bad look rmenslib is a feminist subreddit you cant really go on there and say feminism is wrong about something but feminism while not the cause of all things hurting men often exacerbates those things or at least goes along with them such that you cant discuss the thing without criticizing feminism in other words the whole we discuss mens issues but were not against feminism thing turns into but we dont criticize feminism which turns into a feminist subreddit but with a little more focus on male issues since feminism is such a large force in online gender discussions this is kneecapping the shit out of any possible conversation a few responses to specific things this very us versus them or youre with us or youre against us mentality this is not true most people on rmensrights are protrump i shit on trump on there all the time and get pissed responses but never banned i disagreed with people at rmenslib and was banned its true people on rmensrights are more openly hostile but calling you the bad guy while being all hey buddy arent we all nice people here is still us vs them and this entire interview is us vs them in that it defines rmenslib in opposition to some monolithic other group lets talk about the substance of those issues what are the biggest problems that mens advocacy is trying to address whats the analysis of what the causes and solutions might be heres the thing sometimes there is a clash of interests between groups including men and women an obvious example is rape claims on college campuses making it easier to find a man guilty helps women who are raped hurts innocent men on some level theres a tradeoff which cant be avoided another example is child custory child support feminists understand this and are not shy about the fact that men will lose some things if they get what they want they just think that it would be justified but rmenslib just elides that whole thing notice the problems he listed in response to the above question and solutions when given none ever require anyone to do anything other than for men to change their own behavior i doubt youre really helping men when your solution to every problem is in essence fix it yourself notice how unlike any proposed solutions for womens issues this is and when he gets to a topic where there is an obvious undeniable clash of interests divorces that whole issue is such a bugaboo without pointing fingers i think that different groups will cherrypick the numbers that best support the argument theyre trying to make ive ended up reading a lot about this issue — and the more you read the less you know that just means we need more studies if we take for granted that men get screwed in custody court settlements which i dont its a tiny proportion of the custody issue and when asked about mens and womens issues being oppositional in our space we just dont do it well then i guess it just went away edit one thing i missed the first time is emblematic of this but whether or not its palatable it helps to try not to put men on the defensive to talk about issues in the abstract and i know what some of my social justice activist friends would say about that that you dont back down from speaking truth to power or institutional privilege if you just see men as the privileged ones or the power then you wont ever call on society to meaningfully change to address their problems personally i think that even if men have it better on net than women its more than privilegedoppressed or powerpowerless but if thats your dichotomy you dont just ignore the clash between men and womens interests you take the side of the womens interests and only help men to the extent its a collateral benefit and if theres a clash you go against mens interests at utc wrote i was banned from there when i asked if discussing the harm the duluth model has done to abused men would go against their never question feminism policy i guess thats the answer supporting feminism trumps any consideration for male victims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,weird that feminists would ban some guy shouting what about men at the top of their lungs and who also isnt interested in speaking about womens issues weird weird weird edit this comment immediately upset did you know in men are rapists juststatingfacts™
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like shouting at someone who walks by your clubhouse then ducking and pulling up the ladder in terror of they look back at you wat sick burn dude lmbo this is your brain on altright and loneliness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how hard life is for the white on the continent he stole in the nation he built on the blood and suffering of others where all laws and customs favor him by weight of violence slavery and exploitation the white adhering fanatically to his barbaric religions of conservatism capitalism and christianity is in dire need of civilizing worthwhile people dont become redditors like you this brand of posting is born out of being unwanted by society that is why you cling to it so hard you have nothing else white men are so fragile they could use pixie wings as armor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,weird that feminists would ban some guy shouting what about men at the top of their lungs and who also isnt interested in speaking about womens issues weird wasnt this actually about a sub for mens issues though granted law is a notorious antifeminist so its pretty clear hes not arguing in good faith
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aww hes so adorable wait no the other thing pathetic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,besides all the complaints in this vein there were also a lot and i mean a lot of pedophile joaks yes but sometimes they have issues coming with you in these instances i would recommend letting the child know that you have free candy for him its in the van come on lil buddy and it gets so bad following that line that its probably illegal for me to even copy and paste it in my country why are all men called creepy pedos heres all the best pedo jokes i know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey you might be a creepy fucker but dont tar me with that brush
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,male here this has never happened to me nor my male friends how could be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not men sweetie thats just people like you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not every man is assumed to be a pervert and a paedo youre just a creep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pretty sure this is a reflection of your behavior because nobody has ever assumed me to be a pervert and possible pedophile maybe you should stop being so creepy sounds like victim blaming so if women are treated as less competent in stem fields obviously its because theyre coming across as incompetent and they need to work on that yes if they were really competent they would be seen as competent its simple they cant even tell when their comrades are being sarcastic or not fuck sports i want these people and their mental gymnastics on tv fighting over whos more delusional
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just done get it anymore its not a priledge and it isnt brought up with all guys what is this person complaining about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every male is assumed a pervert and possible pedophile every time a redditor makes a pedo joke and expects them to laugh and upvote you how about that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seems strange how automatically assumed to be a pervert and possible pedophile never comes up on the list of male privileges at utc replied to thats why i try not to get involved let a woman to help seems strange how automatically assumed to be a pervert and possible pedophile never comes up on the list of male privileges httpiimgurcomzdjaocmpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not saying it doesnt happen but its not a systemic problem by any means its probably like shark attacks yeah maybe once a year it happens out of the blue with no reasoning but most of the time you should just not have been poking the shark
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre using the wrong template you need to start out with as a white privileged male like the rest of you which makes my opinion factual and valid cause reasons i
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,right white men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that was a hilarious find nicely done
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think hes saying i dont like it that people think im creepy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they hear words used by sjws and they feel they can just redefine them however they want and use them to the same effect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,speak of the devil a lost little boy right here in this thread well get you back home safe and sound to daddy as you all like to call trump now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive been reading this sub trying to understand some of the concepts that are more foreign to me but i fail to see how a view like this isnt victim blaming ive seen basically this exact same argument regarding rape can you explain how the situations are different
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive met good white men just not many on reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well my analogy was pretty shitty using the exact terms of my analogy it is absolutely victim blaming from one point of view that i didnt directly intend my point was more the overall fear many many people fear shark attacks and are terrified of sharks thing is sharks just dont attack people when a shark does attack a person the person generally attacked first saying oh the one thing they dont tell you about people in the ocean is they get attacked by sharks is true but a stupid statement however its presented as an epidemic like something every man has to deal with which its not most people who say i get accused of being a kidnapper or child rapist are overselling a story they heard i do not deny that it does happen and when it happens its bad finally im very much a words with out actions dont really mean that much for example with the pervert angle if you cat call a girl and get called a pervert and then both of you move on with your lives than thats provoking the shark you got called a pervert now get on with your life with no real consequence if you cat call a girl and she goes to the police and says you tried to rape her than thats a different matter entirely and your actions in no way were deserving of the result if that makes any sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why should everyone have be forced to give up options such as these just because some people dont manage their weight at utc cassiuz replied to while im all for tackling the obesity crisis i hate this idea why should everyone have be forced to give up options such as these just because some people dont manage their weight for example i take care of what i eat and make sure to exercise decently when i go for lunch i quite enjoy a sugary drink such as these now i will have to pay more because of other peoples actions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the ops comment history shows them doubling down on the whole personal responsibility and suffering for the poor choices of others shtick the purpose of the law is primarily aimed towards nipping health issues in the bud for children so im sure theyd yell at children for drinking soda too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh i thought the op was a woman no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it implies it in a relative sense if an average woman who works out is stronger than you as a guy then youre weak for a guy this is bad to people who go to gyms which is why they go to gyms no shit the whole point is that the baseline is the prototypical masculine guy so close yet so far to selfawareness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and the people that say this are almost always skinny nerds that dont leave the house and are weaker than the average female so use this fact in a sad attempt to feel better about themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course you can find that fact printed in any biology textbook right after the chapter on photosynthesis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this sentiment is so annoying because yesthe average the mathematical number shows that men are physically stronger than women but who the fuck is an average
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the average male is considerably stronger than the average female this isnt sexism but biology in reply to thefranster on someone has to say it its actually a little offensive to women this implies that it should be emasculating that a woman is stronger than a man at utc swaggerbucks wrote the average male is considerably stronger than the average female this isnt sexism but biology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men generally weigh more need to eat more and consequently require more effort and resources to keep alive than women do really makes u think hey its not misandry its biology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not even how that works
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not fair i can lift up a bong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,here this might explain it better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think were all okay with this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is grip strength which is completely different women have weaker grip because their skin is different
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uh yeah but do you see all the outliers my point is not every single man will be stronger than every single woman people differ from averages different genes and what not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as youll see from the survey nih has concluded that grip strength strongly correlates with upper body strength in general their skin is different is the kind of biotruth that doesnt account for the average significantly large difference between malefemale grip strength btw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women have weaker grip because their skin is different uhhhhhhh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no clearly every man will not be stronger than every woman thats a given but the strongest man will be stronger than the strongest woman and of men according to that study will be stronger than of women thats just how humans are set up it seems
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,then wheres the graph for upper body strength also b i o t r o o t h
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i woman hope i am in the top percentile my goal is to get buff enough to pole vault people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not sure you understand what strongly correlates means grip strength was used because its easier to measure in a shorter span of time and because it is representative of differences in upper body strength due to grip strength and general upper body strength being equivalent in other studies im uncertain why anyone would choose this hill to die on to be frank males are stronger than females most men are stronger than most women its not sociological its not a product of the patriarchy its a product of biology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the strongest man is strongest that the strongest woman for sure but we talking averages
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and averages make it clear that the average male is stronger than the average female i mean equality and diversity are great but theres a reason the us womens national soccer team loses to high school boys when they scrimmage them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it ought to be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in reply to a comment about the age of consent saying anything under is bad enough care to explain why in reply to ishouldbesolucke on ew yemen i mean anything under is bad enough but seriously what the fuck also i always thought it was across the us at utc hulahoopsmafia wrote anything under is bad enough care to explain why httpiimgurcomeenwbynpng

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy hell either this person is just fishing or has no idea about global history and culture mixed with just trying to make black people look bad a if you are going to say well what about those jews who are heads of hollywood and such then sure you can say that about just about every black million in the entertainment sports business industry just because a few make it big doesnt mean there are still underlying problems for the large percentage in an area b just because you dont hear it in your small circle doesnt mean it doesnt exist asian culture still has tons of bad blood among each of the countries over this stuff that surprises me how many people in useurope seemingly think just disappeared china japan korea arent just some buddybuddy group that perfectly gets along
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do people still say pull up by the bootstraps with a straight face
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people who arent role playing as century robber barons unironically use the phrase pull themselves up by their bootstraps why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,too hard a question im stumped if only there was a word for why itd have to be an ism and maybe start with race raceism racism yeah i should go let him know or something poor guy probably feels bad that he doesnt know why

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is it just that every other race in the country can pull themselves up by their boot straps amd make something of themselves except for black people at utc drbling replied to so in this discussion of black people are the only race in america where bad things have happened to them even though there has never ever been any reason for a bad thing to happen to them are we acting like black people are the only race to come from slavery has everyone been brainwashed to the point that now only african americans have ever been a slave and are the only race to have bad things happen to them in one example jews were never slaves and they never worked their way out of slavery and are now the heads of hollywood jewelry banks and many other very profitable businesses or asians asians have been slaves for thousands of years and they dont have the big bad white man who only hates everyone who doesnt look like them syndromeis it just that every other race in the country can pull themselves up by their boot straps amd make something of themselves except for black people they have to have their hand held and get jobs they are less qualified for because they are the only race to face oppression in the history of not only the united states but also the world give me a break i know that not a lot of trailer trash cousin fucking rednecks get ceo jobs at fortune companies where is the outrage for them no protests or facts saying how inbreed hillbillies have the education but dont get the jobs because nonhillbillies are on the board of directors thinkharder read more spend less time on the streets and more time reading books and make something of yourself and the jobs will follow make money and get hired spend all your time blaming everyone else but yourself and stay in the same place leave the excuses home no one takes them when i dont get a job httpiimgurcomqhlkgdnpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,implying that there was a difference in the first place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who invented peanut butter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bateman disguised his tendencies better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well at least stormfront doesnt allow slurs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,george washington carver wasnt it he did damn near everything else peanutrelated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stormfront would totally allow slurs if they realized they would be as effective at recruitment as reddit is even with slurs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well womens bodily autonomy is part of equality so you dont actually believe in equality for all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean its the fucking womens issues sub you cant go there and wonder why everyone cares about women thats like going to rpeloton and wondering why they dont talk about swimming very much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hope that the terms pro choice and anti choice would start to stick because claiming to be pro life just shows that you dont think womens lives have value because at least the baby could grow up to be a boy right fucking shits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is the dumbest sub ever a subreddit for women who wants things explained to them by mra
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,greetings fellow females here is why you are wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who wants to bet that they support the death penalty support the production of meat and support war
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pro life i believe in equality for all not just people who agree with you edit woops i forgot people on this sub only care about women who agree with them my mistake in reply to sunfirepassionapple on so its a hatecrime and domestic terrorism when it happens to their clinic but when it happens to an abortion clinic its a lone wolf go kindly fuck yourself prolife at utc firstdimensionfilms wrote im pro life and i believe both to be acts of terrorism i believe in equality for all not just people who agree with you edit woops i forgot people on this sub only care about women who agree with them my mistake httpiimgurcomwkeaxiapng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,woops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its bizarre nobody is fighting for compulsory abortions across the board nobody how can you misconstrue fighting for a right with somehow being against equality you cant be oppressed by gaining autonomy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the ability to not be pregnant is the biggest factor in equality between men and women but pro lifers arent concerned about equality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like going to rvegan and wondering why nobodys worried about the financial wellbeing of the chicken farmers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because the baby could grow up to be dead soldiers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it became a default sub probably with the best of intentions if you arent aware trollxc is much better in my opinion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like the other comment said it definitely wasnt always this way at all all the women ive talked to in other womens subs tend to have unsubbed quite a while ago after it defaulted it just got ridiculous and toxic unsurprisingly we tried to get it undefaulted when it became overwhelmingly clear the intention had failed but it was probably too late at that point anyway if youre looking for other actual womens subs theyre all smaller and more niche but theyre pretty decent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i always found the title misleading because httpenwikipediaorgwikitemplatechromosomalabnormalities i might just be nitpicking though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they prioritize the autonomy of the fetus over the autonomy of the woman the fetus is inside funny how agency is all well and good when its in the hands of an entity with no ability to express or act on their desires
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i meant farming animals then killing them for their meat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and its funny that because those same people dont believe in forced organ and body donation after death because fetuses and dead people deserve more rights than women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant believe the amount of people supporting russia over their own president when it comes to the sanctions these people see themselves as america loving patriots but in reality theyre just a treasonous bunch
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hello period cramps my old friend
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just got my hands on from my childhood and wow its still fun as hell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hi im new brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine having stuck in your head for two weeks welcome to my life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unpopular opinion all but two good people left the cast of law order svu and now it sucks if we could get john munch elliot stabler and don cragen back thatd be nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im new here whats up with downvotes here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where did the bird logo come from anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the cult of personality is what rules these people now reality has a well known liberal bias so its important for them to ignore reality i see a lot of people saying that president obama is doing all of this last minute so if trump tries to change it it will give demos political capital to call trump out on it but i dont know why they are saying that after witnessing a yearandahalf long election cycle where trump literally lied and contradicted himself almost every day and never lost support for it these people are not worth saving they will not plug holes in the ship they will continue to open new ones all for the pleasure of seeing liberals sink with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have my own ideas as to how americans should respond to russias hacking but since i dont want to end up on a list for incitement im going to keep my trap shut
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i remember that game did you find a download of it or a disc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i spent way too much time on this game
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the top arrow downvotes the bottom arrow upvotes and every count is preceded by a so they all look negative
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i found a disc for an older version which wasnt the one i played so i went and downloaded that one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not yet ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,years ago is too far back removed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is that a rule
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not specifically to be honest it just felt wrong to me i guess try for posts not old enough to be archived yet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think you should remove everything that feels wrong to you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cunts just a word make it what you want i say things are gay but in no way do i mean gays or any term of insult now stop being a gay cunt and get the fuck back to work at utc replied to cunts just a word make it what you want i say things are gay but in no way do i mean gays or any term of insult now stop being a gay cunt and get the fuck back to work httpiimgurcomvrearbypng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lhf removed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i made a comment suggesting we kill all hispanics asians and black people and the freaks banned me fucking cucks i am a race realist and think that the only real humans are white anglosaxons in reply to lsdoughnut on how does rthedonald have sjw censorship at utc patroclusthelost wrote i made a comment suggesting we kill all hispanics asians and black people and the freaks banned me fucking cucks i am a race realist and think that the only real humans are white anglosaxons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to think these are the people that may be choosing americas next president anne franks sister wasnt wrong when she said trump reminded her of hitler
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no i would not please go back to stormfront now and by the way freedom of speech does not include the right to say you want to mass murder muslims or japanese people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its ironic because the partition of india empowered the hindu nationalists which make life worse for indian christians abrahamics are all in the same boat in india
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just shows how ignorant op is any history book tells you how the western invaders caused all the problems and tricked muslim and hindus to fight one another so they would ignore what the invaders were doing pathetic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive never understood how people think the trick to moderating islam and transforming it into a relatively harmless religion like modern day christianity judaism etc is to respect it and enable it crusades never happened then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muslims are a gangrene that must be amputated just a redditor expressing their view but god forbid we bash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fun fact there are only ten million less muslims in india than in pakistan about million so i dont really know what this person is on about so on redditcom calling million people a vicious gangrene which should be amputated totally okay im not mad the real nazis all say bash the fash anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as an indian christian albeit nonpractising i cannot be more thankful for the partition of india it was a painful process and cost a lot of lives but my country got rid of a vicious gangrene that would have eaten us up if the amputation didnt happen at utc maushichigaaand replied to as an indian christian albeit nonpractising i cannot be more thankful for the partition of india it was a painful process and cost a lot of lives but my country got rid of a vicious gangrene that would have eaten us up if the amputation didnt happen httpiimgurcomtahfawlpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know if id say the same boat i think discrimination and violence against muslims is significantly worse than against christians but generally i agree with where youre coming from
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hindu nationalists dont make life worse for indian christians only the foreign evangelists who are trying mass conversion in rural india normal christians are doing just fine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a relatively harmless religion like modern day christianity judaism etc now if you dont mind im going to mutilate my sons dick drag my lesbian daughter to death from the back of my truck and reinstitute chattel slavery for anyone tanner than a frenchman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,organized religion is reactionary to the extreme spirituality like any other dimension of the self tends to mold itself to the material conditions of the time and locus
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and reinstitute chattel slavery for anyone tanner than a frenchman this only happened after the columbian exchange
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,chattel slavery predates the century
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes and it was largely ran by nonchristian romans and greeks the type of chattel slavery you are talking about where race was the determining factor was created as part of the columbian exchange
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes and it was largely ran by nonchristian romans and greeks christianity was adopted by constantine precisely because it sanctioned slavery and pacified territory the religion of the slaves became the tool of their oppression islam was employed in a similar fashion justifying the captivity and conquest of infidels as a moral imperative the type of chattel slavery you are talking about has existed for thousands of years around the globe under a host of governments and religions the colombian exchange industrialized the process certainly but it wasnt a significant departure from the general treatment of women warcaptives or landed serfs elsewhere the only real change was the moral excuse for abhorrent treatment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,christianity was adopted by constantine precisely because it sanctioned slavery and pacified territory except that christianity wasnt adopted by constantine as the religion of the empire that was theodosius i all constantine did was end the persecution of christians which was no longer politically possible because there were so many of us the colombian exchange industrialized the process certainly but it wasnt a significant departure from the general treatment of women warcaptives or landed serfs elsewhere the only real change was the moral excuse for abhorrent treatment the columbian exchange made it racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit why must you ruin everything theres a gif of a cheerleader welcoming home her brother from the military its sweet the girl jumphugs the guy and he catches her and its allaround heartwarming the comments are exactly what youd expect its as though redditeurs cant fathom people being close without the relationship being sexual leave your goddamn incrst fetish out of this pls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck i caved and did the mew glitch on blue im not going to use it for the main story or anything its just nice to have one there were some serious oversights in the programming of that game
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,got banned from politics for calling a white supremacist an idiot whoops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im tempted to try and correlate stemlords and dunningkruger
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bought witcher and doom doom isnt really for me but god damn is witcher good i do dislike the way the controls work on a
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,daily statistics for joaks concerning ptsd specifically triggered for school saint peters college location auckland new zealand before school english rephilosophy interval economics study lunch physics biology total edit got a mention on rsrssucks moving up in the world i guess edit edit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i admitted to my doctor that ive been using weed to treat the nausea caused by my undiagnosed illness suspected gastroparesis and she spent a good portion of the meeting telling me i need to smoke less then prescribed me an antiemetic antinausea medication that i just saw has lethal interactions with both my antidepressants that she didnt even mention feeling weed oppressed this is a joke but also seriously that was neglectful as hell of my doctor wtf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah your names ben judging by your post history
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edit should be children but they just scary ghost scary ghost scary ghost fixed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no it just makes me mad the magic community is dealing with an issue right now and kia is up in arms about it no the guy sexually harrased a trans woman im glad he seems genuinely remorseful and wants to educate himself but his actions were serious and do have serious consequences shut up kia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love using that thing as an hm dumping ground fun fact if you have the patience you can use a slightly modified version of the glitch to get every pokemon in the game plus all variants of missingno plus horrifying glitch pokemon with horrifying glitch moves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone down voted you for that lol two weekends ago i was up in chicago with family from to about midnight we all hung out in my cousins back yard drinkin wine and bullshittin at a comfortable mid it was beautiful this past weekend back in tennessee it was almost degrees at oclock saturday night its downright depressing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,busses are like greenhouses on wheels during the summer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol someone spent half of last night trying to convince me to by witcher i didnt actually need that much convincing i just want to beat first lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how the fuck do people make this joke everyday god
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow sounds like it was funny times for real though sorry you have to deal with that garbage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow your doctor is shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre proud of saying something shitty im now curious what you think srs worthy means cause i see nothing really offensive and you also asked how one might become reddit famous posting to srs isnt going to make you reddit famous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it seems in poor taste almost like youre showing off how terrible you were
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh child no go away
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its srs people complain about the brigading we apparently do then come here and downvote everything to really show us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i envy you i got after years of owning and but not playing them it and now i cant go back its like trying to play after playing inquisition i got spoiled by the open world and the jumping
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i used to be one of these people and i still dont know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least its the last term of the last year also last year i was one of these people ugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i tried to think of some clever comment to make but im honestly too disgusted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wasnt intentionally scaring my classmates to foster racism thats pretty great in comparison in reply to blalien on the real story is that a bunch of redditors had an obsessive hateboner over a year old boy who will never affect their lives in any way what were you doing when you were that was so great at utc wrote i wasnt intentionally scaring my classmates to foster racism thats pretty great in comparison httpiimgurcomvnxwijipng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant reddit is seriously defending the government crushing someones hopes and dreams
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,racist dog whistle and rape jokes classy stuff rnews
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a straight white dude fuck you no it isnt its a crime shitbag
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh i get it bc undocumented immigrants haw haw haw hilarious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,＾◡＾っ✂╰⋃╯
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,must have been a redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like i appreciate that this comment is entirely composed of buzzwords but what is he trying to say exactly i honestly dont know what hes getting at all rape was actually consensual but the consent was undocumented so like all rape accusations are therefore false where exactly does the racial component come in like whats the point of that i think people are just upvoting it because they assume its offensive but i cant even wrap my head around it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,murdering redditors is just undocumented capital punishment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditry is just undocumented sociopathy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can joke about rape but touch our vidya games and youre crossing the line
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we can just think ourselves lucky there was no did you just assume joke i think this is actually progress one step at a time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae is horny as i am right now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but hey rape culture does exist right jesus christ
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is extremely creepy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rape is just undocumented consent in reply to on thats undocumented rapist sir at utc nanoelite wrote rape is just undocumented consent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive found that the those who bring up male rape during discussions of female rape are often the same people who mock male rape victims and downplay the harm of male rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,high quality insight into the average rediteurs mind you got the rambling selfcontradiction just right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a bi white guy fuck him too not that i would ever contemplate it edited to avoid ambiguity my apologies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one cares about your sexuality or race
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh wow this joak was like a shit onion it just kept getting worse the more i bit into it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,steals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i should have perhaps added more context in the title not that any explanation for posting something like this would make it more logical its after a slew of asshat jokes about illegalundocumented immigrants who commit rape racism and trivializing sexual assault all in one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sadly its quite welldocumented
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh its the reddit version of the found the vegan meme why do i even come here this is depressing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yet 🤦‍♂️
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how is that an at least they make racist rape jokes rather than transphobic jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean no one liberal or conservative should ever feel that they are allowed to say this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if we uhh dont wish rape upon folks maybe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uhhh bye beenbadben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that would really solve a lot of problems have you thought of taking that to kickstarter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the real truth behind what about the men is that they dont even care about the men its not even an attempt to shift focus its an attempt to stop focus
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and why do they think that the people who care about rape victims dont care about male rape victims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if your counterpoint is something even you dont take seriously like people who bring up male rape as a counterpoint to female rape but dont even view the issue of male rape as all that legitimate that actually makes it better at distracting from the topic at hand than it would be if it were something you actually gave a shit about life hack
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or make that super funny where was that teacher when i was in highschool xd lucky guy joak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hahaha not funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why dont you make like a hundred dollar bill and get benned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i should clarify that i wasnt aware of the racial component at the time of writing it seemed like he was making one of reddits asinine rape justifying jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who bites into an onion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its only got two layers though rape jokes and racism and neither of those layers can even manage to be funny if youre gonna tell a fucked up joke at least be funny goddamn reddit is just like that one creepy guy at work who doesnt know how to act like an adult and who bothers you with his weird creepy nerd shit because some asshole told him you have a steam account sarah thank you sarah for telling the weird nerd manbaby i play games brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who bites into shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no i copyrighted it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as opposed to both calm down ffs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they cannot conceive of empathy for anyone but someone like yourself so obviously when feminists talk about rape victims they are only talking about women and thats just wrong not that theyre gonna do anything about it just use it to stop you being loud about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey that vitriol wasnt directed at you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,masochists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people who need to wash the taste of onions out of their mouths
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youll have to forgive me the level of nazism on the internet has caused irony to explode so ive ended up taking most things seriously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,onions are delicious your palate needs work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wise decision im afraid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i bet theres a lot of poc people who wish they could just get over it but when you get shit like that nonstop its pretty hard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he should be banned period but well take what we can get
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny i thought redditors were all about the pc master race
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people get really irrational when someone they like gets caught doing bad things when jeremy clarkson was fired from the bbc for punching a producer for not having a good dinner for him it was like half the british public were excusing it saying that it should be ok to do hes the star treat him right that the bbc was making a terrible mistake he assaulted someone get over it should have been arrested this kid was being a racist prick inciting hatred dont let him off easily i mean boo hoo he cant play a game for a year and a half
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are white men so mad at not being able to say the n word like they remind me of year olds who run around saying fuck because they think its funny and it gets them attention
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh ffs almost everybody has some online presence now lets not pretend the internet is a super exclusive club its now just another way for people irl to communicate i was hoping that by this point offline social mores would have influenced online behaviour but it seems more and more like the opposites happened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the internet they say as if that excuses this sort of behavior as if it makes it not matter as if it doesnt have an effect on people and their lives yeah its the internet and the internet is a powerful communication tool it easily gives a megaphone to people who would be unable to influence anyone without it we can reach more people as common citizens than pretty much any time in the past with that comes responsibility its about time to take it seriously and stop writing it off as a playground apart from reality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its csgo what did you guys expect lol online competitive gaming communities are straight garbage ive learned especially csgo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,til its ok to be a racist in the name of unpc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he should get banned for max a week for saying its the internet get over it i cant stand pc people in reply to tuataratim on few referenced post by i submitted a ticket to get a kid banned for the same thing and all tim said was we dont police what kids say its literally impossible to police it all nbsp by buckets united states esea black accounttim hello we do not police what users say over the internet and instead have a mute and block system this means you never have to hear people like that and as soon as someone starts insulting you use one of the commands i listed above this faq httpsplayeseanetindexphpssuppor explains the system in detail thank you for using the esea support system so i cant get banned for saying the nword in a pug nice to know but esea can just randomly select people to ban for days i agree he should be banned but you should be consistent with your policies the latter quote is the response to someone who submitted a ticket to esea complaining about racial slurs in a pug i think days is excessive ibp got a year getting very tired of esea and especially the way they enact rules when its convenient for them eu premier denial roster this edit formatting at utc wrote he should get banned for max a week for saying it its the internet get over it i cant stand pc people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay take this kid pump him full of anger hormones sit him in front of a game where you kill people remove all opportunity to physically lash out get upset when he verbally lashes out hes get over yourself clearly its the punishment not the game and lifestyle thats an issue
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its such an easy rule to follow not saying the n word is so easy like so easy i just went three sentences without saying it now four they make it sound like its a useful word they really need to say
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,little brat will have forgotten in a week because hell sulk then go back to playing other games or make a new account and be obnoxious some other way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they even pulled off a fully automated luxury gay space communism chain later on in the thread so its like at least not wasteland the rest is still probably wasteland tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its interesting because when i woke up it was at karma with gold and then about hours later it was sitting at karma with gold
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bonus points the person in this story is years old hes not even a white man hes one of those boys saying a naughty word for attention days is practically forever to someone that only has years of memory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats probably exactly what it is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its csgo what did you guys expect lol for people to act like decent human beings for a change i understand the exasperation but come the fuck on its really irritating when someone says what did you guys expect when youre trying to criticize shitty behavior
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,try lol or dota
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man i love that meme
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,an oasis in a waste land of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just quit lol because of the community was playing since uninstalled last week
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dota is weird youll see garbage voted up to the top in a thread but youll also see a reasonable counter response as the top response cant speak for lol of csgo i remember recently when sing sing got temp banned from twitch for using a racist bot there were people defending him but also people saying well its a racist bot so what did you expect tbh i blame meme streamers that cater to the antisjw crowd who have no sense of filter people look at those streamers and think yeah i can say stuff like that too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rocker league is the worst kill yourself is a greeting there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh and then you have subs like rpublichealthwatch and others popping up all over reddit such a shame
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly the answer is to deport all the illegals theyll be happier in europe where they belong anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every reddit admin can go fuck themselves for letting this shit happen constantly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh we have the best babes makes my stomach churn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god it fucking terrifies me that these people are out there its easy to say dont worry they never leave their basements haha or theyd never do any of the stuff they say they would in real life and thats probably true for of cases but even that is enough to make me feel scared to leave my own house
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre doing the brds work if only the admins were as dedicated as you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you okay friend reading this kind of shit daily cant be good for you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny when people say stuff about trans people in are bathrooms they dont say anything about ftm people raping young boys i guess they dont exist so rape children all you want trans men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but somehow transgender people who want to fit in so badly would vote for trump sad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no because then theyll complain that they have to coexist with the of people there that are muslims these people will always find a marginalized group of people to complain about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how long did it take for the fattening to die down why dont they just play whacamole with shit subs until the toxic folks get bored
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were supposed to fuck them to get rid of bastions of freeze peaches such as rfatpeoplehate remember ill volunteer to sleep with the admins on this one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont worry they got milo so obviously theyre pro lgbt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,banning fatpeoplehate is useless if you dont change the culture of the site by being watchful for replacement subs and fphesque brigades in other subs like how worldnews always has a few topics about islam hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae women only have worth when they please my cispeen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same deal here i feel so unsafe and vulnerable theres just too many transphobes like this well at least i have srs at least not everyone is hateful and some actually call these trumpets out on their shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,since when has reddit ever seen men who rape as a problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kombatbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,valuable conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think many of them are mras and racists themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do alt right wingers talk like theyre in a fantasy novel
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where do i even start with this the awkward choice of vocab annihilate all civilized interactions presumably to sound like le enlightened logickal redditortm the fact that a fascist is the one preaching about misinformation and self esteem fueled opinions so many options to choose from
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this redditor is the definition of the most disgusting part of the altright cesspool developing now a pure concoction of misinformation and self esteem fueled opinions that annihilate all civilized interactions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,op misspelled reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a big boy u must be to know such big boy words
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does anyone know wtf this person means by that last sentence annihilation

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is no free speech for leftists on reddit the silence of all the freeze peach nazis is deafening
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not an anarchist but any committed leftist is a friend of mine the idea that such calls to violence should in any way be the top priority of reddit admins shows exactly how much they love being at the center of altright sexist transphobic homophobic and neonazi action its disgusting

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is no free speech for leftists on reddit what have you not been to any of the countless left leaning political subs that hit the front page of rall constantly rpolitics is a default and it doesnt have a problem with censorship same with the countless stupid communism subreddits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dindu nuffin ah yes starting your post with a white supremacist meme always a good way to begin another valuable conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black person does bad thing yesyesyes think of all the racism i can get away with for this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all of the justice subreddits are horrifying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit should automatically ban anyone who uses that dogwhistle term
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they should just exterminate the entire family theres no good that can come from those people breeding and they deserve to be taken out of the gene pool courtesy of uhippopotato getting tired of shit like this how is this not a threat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it makes me feel a little better that he was caught not long after and sent to a supermax facility where he was forced to spend hours a day in a cell the size of a small parking space with one hour of recreation per day what the actual fuck is wrong with people on this website its like theyre not even trying to not say niers and the only reason they cant do it is because their mother is behind them dont be judgmental by assuming something being said is racist or used in a racist way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lives in a country built by black people on stolen land black people didnt do nothing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,genocide

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its interesting that when a video is posted of a white guy doing the same thing in the same thread the comments are about how he was playacting and recommending therapy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree whites males should be removed from society
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that thread is horrifying these people should not be given any power
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you hear that uspez lots of valuable conversation going on here at reddit dot com
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are some threads and some entire subreddits that so clearly exist for this exact purpose whether its bashing women muslims black people whoever outrage bait for conservative white men ive thought many times of creating a subreddit for white crime or something similar but then i remember that i would have to surround myself with terrible shit all the time its just not worth it despite how many laughs i think it would generate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for an extra dose of irony top comment saying that she probably has dementia because if youre white its probably just a mental illness not like those entitled black folks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,minorities can also be shitty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the word justice doesnt even have positive connotations anymore it just means losing your shit when someone makes a mistake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,definitely i used to enjoy some of the videos especially the sports related ones but the comments are so incredibly toxic they seem to think that over the top retribution justice false rape accusation you should be charged with attempted murder gloated at a football game literally hitler execute him woman slapped a man fucking dropkick her thatll show those feminazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dogwhistle more like megaphone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit doing something to combat hate speech
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that would require uspez to grow a spine or to hire another minority to make the change for him to use as a scapegoat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant even think of a way to well actually justify that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hereyou dropped your plate of tendies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that comment was about a white teen who shot people at school someone posted video in comments
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually the phrase the linked poster used originated because after one of the far too many black man shot by white man for nebulous reasons incidents a grieving relative said something like he didnt do nothing he was a good kid its spelled the way it is because making fun of aave accents passes as funny on the poop side of reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the whites are worthless yes but the ableism is horrible thanks for fixing the ableism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i personally agree that people should need licences to procreate but only white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that feel when you realize privilege power
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbh he probably agrees with this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rblackcrimematters in particular is probably the most depressing example of poorlydisguised internet hate ive ever seen the thing that infuriates me the most about that is that crime definitely is a problem in certain innercity black communities but the people who frequent these subs could never ever conceivably give a shit about actually trying to improve those environments that lead to people becoming criminals it is all about trying to find opportunities to go on their cathartic bigot tirades i encourage your idea it would serve as a good countermeasure to those hate groups so they see how disgusting their opportunist racism is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kind of like free speech
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a lot of dogwhistles give some form of plausible deniability there is no context to use this and not be racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh freeze peach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pupbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but thats what makes this joak sound doubly shitty to me theyre arguing about whether or not a black man did something to justify being murdered but if we zoom out we see that black people did everything they built this country and had it stolen from them the us doesnt merely owe black people it is owed to them and to native americans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fixed sorry im out of the loop i thought that was supposed to be laughter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just a heads up i think people are interpreting this as black people are worthless not the intended white supremacists are worthless
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow they actually call them nggers and baboons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it used to be the banner for rcoontown
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ex dee
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what kind of pupper is that it kinda looks lke a shiba

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a tiny doggo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,comparing her to a pedophile or a molester or someone who maliciously harms children is fucking insulting to people who were actually molested in reply to angelnursery on lena dunham molested her little sister and i still think she should be thrown in jail edit honestly the people trying to say that putting rocks into a toddlers vagina and continuing to molest a child until youre are fucking creepy i hope you either grow up or get therapy at utc slomsh wrote the witchhunt against her is just ridiculous she did not molest her sister she wrote about completely normal childhood experimentation when she was seven years old and in the same book she wrote about masturbating in the same bed as her sister when she was a teenager we all masturbate in strange places those were literally the only two incidents that were used to stir this drama about her and it was all started by a conservative news site research it i understand not liking lena dunham but every time her name comes up these vitriolic lies are perpetuated and it is really insulting to everyone who has had completely normal childhood experiences like she has its also insulting to her sister to claim that she is wrong for not feeling like a victim her sister stands with lena hell she was even on her show girls and did not feel as if she was molested because she wasnt i have literally seen people argue that she was groomed which is ridiculous there is literally no proof that she molested her sister at all the passages of her book that were taken out of context were completely innocuous a bit bizarre to share with the world but that is what her book was about baring the most private gross weird parts of herself if you read the rest of the book or knew her humorwriting at all you would understand the exaggerativecandid way she writes things yes she used the term sexual predator as a joke and that was uncalled for but it was a joke and that is obvious when you read the excerpts i know ill get downvoted to hell for this but i dont give a fuck heres an op ed from someone with my perspective that may clear up the matter a little more she cites a child development expert who states the obvious weird experimentation at years old is completely normal the comments in every thread about her disgust me every time i have said this all before but in rsex once there was a man who genuinely admitted to molesting someone when he was young when he didnt realize what he was doing because he was a child what he did was far far worse than what lena did because it was sexual the pebble thing lena describes was not really sexual it seems like pure curiosity and he was older and knew the other party wasnt consenting in a way people showed him the utmost compassion and shared their stories of experiencing similar things because most of us understand that when were little kids we can fuck up and experiment in weird ways that dont make sense to us yet yet when a celebrity fucks up in the public eye a lynchmob forms immediately and people will not listen to reason this myth will never die because people literally get off on foaming at the mouth of lena dunham it is all over reddit you cannot be a child molester when you are fucking years old and beyond that what she did was not molestation it was completely harmless if her sister didnt feel violated at all by it why is the public so up in arms about it about a seven year old would we do this to anyone other than lena and as for masturbating in the same bed as her sisteryou can get off your high horseyes its weird but nothing she did was malicious and she did not harm her sister in any way we all got endlessly entertained by weird masturbation stories on reddit but when it comes to lena we act all righteous how dare someone masturbate in the same bed as their sleeping sibling when theyre a horny teenager its just stupid we all do stupid weird shit sometimes it wasnt evil comparing her to a pedophile or a molester or someone who maliciously harms children is fucking insulting to people who were actually molested endrant edit i understand if you got caught up in the hatefrenzy and do not want to see my perspectivebut just read this article with an open mind this article interviews child sexual abuse experts about lena and they all conclude similar things this is not molestation a quote sharon lamb author of several research papers on child sexual abuse including normal childhood sexual play and games differentiating play from abuse says of dunham this is really within the norms of childhood sexual behavior she says is another decent article and also explains and sources how this controversy started on conservative antifeminist blog sites a quote from that article from a writer at the kinsey institute dunhams story is not one of sexual exploration and she doesnt describe any sexual acts the story she tells is one of bodily exploration sex is not a part of it her story also includes her sisters own exploration in that it turns out her sister had been putting pebbles inside her own vagina some small girls put things in their vaginas—toys pebbles legos etc—there is a case study of a year old girl who put a bratz doll in her vagina a quote from the article worth pondering none of this lena dunham abused her sister narrative seems to be rooted in concern for her sister who is decidedly fine and the last sentence sums it up well lena dunham isnt the epitome of feminism shes also not a child molester step away from your keyboards look around find the real enemy edit more great articles to read copying from a reply i made to a guy who took issue to me linking a salon article which is understandable though as i mentioned this topic is complex and subjective sorry for all the edits but i just found this from a guy who was put on the sex offender registry for exploring as a child directed to lena dunham on the center for sexual justice siteits worth a read the point again is children should not be demonized and unduly punished for these behaviors a quote i hope that you too can agree that children like you should not be labeled as sex offenders i urge you to look into this further and learn more about the harmful effects of sex offender registries on children and families and here is a great article from rewire with the title when people use the term child molestation to describe dunhams account of something she did when she was seven years old or later as a teenager theyre applying adult standards of criminality and intent to a childs behavior yes children can be creepy and inappropriate thats why adults work to teach them to do better thats why we dont generally hold adults legally or morally responsible for things they do as children its a sound practice one that the accumulated weight of medical and scientific evidence supports strengthening and affirming edit hey this is the first time ive been featured on srs or srsucks not sure of the difference because they seem to act the same hey guys d httpiimgurcombxjrqmvpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hitting a nazi bad assault is bad violence is bad youre bad if you hit a nazi hitting a woman she deserved it this is good do this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit just loves the needless escalation of force doesnt it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres the thing the reason these selfdefense revenge fantasies exist is because men like this really really want an excuse to hit women thats pretty much it like sure if someone is attacking you defend yourself but dont get a hardon at the idea of slapping a woman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah stupid bitch deserved it honestly its one thing to completely beat up a woman its another completely separate thing to merely slap her back if she slaps you its not like her life was in danger in reply to yummygumdrops on yeah but in the guidelines they sign for the show the host isnt allowed to touch the contestant thats why he hits he back and says how can she slap at utc trashdiver wrote yeah stupid bitch deserved it honestly its one thing to completely beat up a woman its another completely separate thing to merely slap her back if she slaps you its not like her life was in danger
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being slapped doesnt justify immediately and with full force slapping someones face theyre both idiots why does reddit feel like it needs to defend the dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good thing violence is always the answer except to nazis listen to what the have to say reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,very good point never thought of it this way thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i got dogpiled in that thread for pointing out that subtle nuance of rampant sexism in india it was like a testosteronefilled mosh pit of boys screaming we are not violent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unless its nazis thenmuh free speech
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well you see the other person was a feeeeemale
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and well punch you in the nose if you suggest otherwise yeah i know the type
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well because when you punch a nazi youre punching them for their beliefs which is always wrong even when they love genocide when you punch a woman its just because shes a woman so that makes it ok i want to not have to add the s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol they literally told me to kill myself so yeah a little bit more than just we will punch you but what can you expect from men edit annnd i got from their shitty sub for metalink participation lol i commented in their sub before this submission even got submitted but they havent touched the two users who have told me that i should kill myself what absolute shitsticks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anyone who talks about le logic like this obviously doesnt know the first thing about actual formal logic also you can be certain theyre a fullblown idiot see le amazing le atheist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good for that guy he used his logic to cleverly deduce that when trying to appeal to potential sex partners people generally select a flattering photo of themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,logic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,logic tells me she probably shops her pictures or cleverly takes them to look more attractive in reply to handsupamazing on id like to know the story of rule get on it op at utc dstaller wrote logic tells me she probably shops her pictures or cleverly takes them to look more attractive guy swipes right guy asks girl on a date guy pulls up guy sees girl that is either much larger than pictures suggest or much uglieror both guy drives away without hesitation tldr dont give people false hope
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,see le amazing le atheist id prefer not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a former pedophile uhhuh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but its jokes about amy schumers vagina that make them lose their minds
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh yea pedophilia joak very funny totally not tired shite that nobody with a functioning sense of humor wants to hear any more
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow comedy is really easy i fuck kids hahahahahahahah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,former
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,drink edit this thread is totes getting brigaded damn srs why are you brigading yourself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,while i think pedophilia is bad as much as the next guy hmm i wonder if thats true i guess it depends what the next guy actually says try and tell people about the fact that pedophilia is not illegal and should not be illegal and theres a difference between thoughts in your head and raping children and see how fast it takes for dumbasses to put their dumb on show and the next one pedophilia isnt illegal nor should it be negative bonus irony edit two of those guys i quoted above have recently argued all muslims are terrorists it seemsits fair to tar all muslims with one brush but remember not to be so prejudiced towards your friendly neighbourhood pedophile folks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how the fuck does someone even know where to get child porn to stick on you i suppose i could search for it and download it and then get arrested myself maybe if i use proxies and tor and a computer at the library while wearing a disguise then how do i get it onto your computer in a way that looks like you downloaded it this whole argument is fucking stupid im sure intelligence agencies can and do do this sort of thing but a normal person probably couldnt without making it obvious it was planted or getting into trouble
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres my take on this yeah sure pedophilia is clearly some kind of mental illness and im sure that there are plenty of people out there with those kinds of urges who havent done anything to harm a child and instead repress those feelings this fucking priest wasnt one of them he possessed enough cp to be charged with counts thats images he got off to where a child was being harmed in grotesque and inhumane ways more reasons for a sociopath to kidnap a child and force the child into cp reddit has an unhealthy obsession with defending pedophiles and child molesters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jesus ive forgotten how many pedophilia apologists there were on this website until i read that damn thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,woah jfc just write a book already
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shit theyre onto us sissssters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dammit wont someone please think of the pedophiles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a person who doesnt actively think about framing people for crimes i feel like it would be easier to frame someone using other things and the person doing the framing would be less likely to have moral issues than they would with cp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i actually commented a few times in this thread and got downvoted for not being a pedo basically i came here thinking someone wouldve posted it and im fucking glad you did because i was getting far too vexed at a shitty website
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is mens rea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone is racist now eh alright here we go white people are fucking trash having fun nazlypuffs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,except thats not true computer experts get people off with this when hackers have used their computers to put kiddy porn on it he was found with the least amount under british law to be charged which is images youre arrested for less than that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i now know to be fucking careful if anyone really wanted to frame you for anything they could just stick cp on you in reply to darthgiggitygig on louisiana has some of the toughest child porn laws in the country each picture equals years in prison priests get no breaks in louisiana over this child sex shit anymore he will do hard time will probably plead to enough years so that he will never be released from prison he will probably end up at dixon or angola and stands a very good chance of being attacked and killed in prison the inmates hate sex crimes and really hate sex crimes involving children so boo fucking hoo at utc alexander wrote while i think pedophilia is bad as much as the next guy i cant help but feel this mentality is potentially dangerous someone i know accused of something i dont like get murdered in prison you fuck i mean seriously does everyone else not see how kinda wtf this mentality is and anyone that dares say anything pointing this stuff out gets demolished by the community as if ever saying anything related to the topic other than they should be ripped limb from limb in prison is immediate taboo i now know to be fucking careful if anyone really wanted to frame you for anything they could just stick cp on you and as soon as youre caught with it youll be dead to everyone apparently cp is like the new burn the witch mob mentality and i understand theres damn good reason for the hate behind it but cant help feel its dangerous and vulnerable to abuse and really what ever happened to being humane its funny reddit is all about human rights and being humane until certain issues come up then theyre suddenly fine with murder and rape in prisons and dont care if someone is violently tortured to death i think theres a lot of people that need to realize that they cant act like they stand on a moral high ground while wishing those sorts of things on any kind of person even the most horrible ones times like this im glad the founding fathers addressed cruel and unusual punishment in the constitution clearly many people lose their humanity when certain topics popup edit i understand this guy might be guilty and if he does he deserves prison he hasnt even gone to trial yet but just that prison not a cruel and unusual punishment just because for some reason people find sexual crimes more heinous than bloody murder no im not a cp apologist ffs i understand how serious this is and that we do need to have laws against the consumer base in this case this isnt like drugs where arresting the individuals for possession is stupid though i think we need to do a damn good job verifying it was them and not planted being damn careful not to have kneejerk outraged reactions thatll lead to us believing theyre guilty immediately otherwise seriously slippery slope here folks we do wanna keep possession illegal in this case but ffs please be careful about it dont let it become the modern witch hunts but i just find it incredible and weird that a lot of the time people are gonna hate you more for having pictures and videos like those than they would if you were a mass murderer i see more violent and cruel things said about this kinda guy than i do about the terrorist attacks it just seems wrong and scary not to mention how people just lose everything that makes them human at the drop of a hat once the wrong topic comes up its really scary to me tbh being a humane person means being against cruel and unusual punishment even for the very worst of people even for the mass shooters even for hitler or stalin or bin laden even for obviously sick fucks like ian watkins probably the worst cp case i can think of and i hate it because lostprophets was a band i actually liked before if theyre in my prison theyd be serving their time like everyone else and theyre gonna be kept from killing each other because prisons shouldnt be a fucking zoo contrary to what theyve actually become in the us i wouldnt be able to see myself as morally correct if give anyone different punishment and treatment just because i find their crimes especially nasty but i suppose some people would just call me a pussy for that viewpoint and proceed to torture and kill them i suppose what im trying to say is something like being human means being humane even to people that have long thrown their humanity away themselves being humane to even them because were supposed to be better than them but yeah like i said i guess some people will just call that a pussy and move along to them id usually say something like well sorry that me being unable to turn myself into a barbarian makes me a pussy but thats the honest attitude ive gotten several times when discussing different crimes and me getting uncomfortable when they start talking about all kinds of horrible things they wanna do the person or hoping theyre violently raped and killed in prison and so on and so forth i dunno just seems like a slippery slope and it all makes me sick to my stomach too youd think people would learn this is the kinda thing that becomes a big focal point to just about every fantasy story ever especially ones with heroes if you start treating anyone even the bad guys that way then youll no longer be good yourself batman will never kill the joker because hes better than that ya get me tons and tons and tons of examples of that and yet here we are still talking about it but yeah as i said im damn glad the founding fathers put cruel and unusual punishment into the constitution from discussions like these i can see plain as day why we needed the amendment edit ive replied to most replies to this comment which has led to me bringing up more and more points my god i swear that one could write a book on the philosophy of justice and how we define things being right or wrong as a society and how we enforce those views and how we seem more hellbent on revenge than anyone actually being better off thats really where my mind falls into i guess that being said folks ive got other things to do now life calls and all that might be back later but i think ill let others carry on without me now i think ive said what i have to say at the end of the day its just basically that stuffs generally messed up and it breaks my heart for everyone involved really i guess at the end of the day its just another wishy washy comment from some emotional overlysentimental dude im just glad im not one of these guys and i hope nobody ever tries to pin anything like it on me i guess scary stuff some of you have valid points against it too of course my dad always said im blinded by sentimentality and will end up dead if i approach life that way still i guess thats been a risk im willing to take this stuff just doesnt settle with me i still wanna save everyone i can i guess i can make myself cold when i really need to but thats always been a very last resort seems a lot of people get straight to it though httpiimgurcomqjltdnwpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol as if anyone needs to actually plant anything with such convincing defense of pedophiles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but let me tell you why its bad when spooky scary brown people do it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,filed away under what is consent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh my fucking god ive had it with this website those creeps will do anything to justify it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this would be a much better srs post than the op edit sorry my point is that this comment is much more offensive than what is portrayed in the op it was not my intention to insult the srster
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a friend of mine works for the county police and sometimes the fbi on cyber crimes thats simply not how this sort of investigation happens with cyber crime the most important thing is chain of custody an investigator will never access your hard drive in a readwrite state furthermore the way they find these guys is in child porn trading communities and on areas of the web where predators are actively targeting children because surprise surprise they dont actually want to imprison innocent people or waste their time and resources on someone who hasnt done anything wrong i mean i guess if you were an enemy of the state they could plant it on you be a lot easier to just plant drugs on you though even agencies like the fbi have protocols they follow to preserve evidence this guy is just paranoid because he has child porn on his computer edit oh and by the way the whole he was accused not convicted line while in general i agree with it cp is pretty straightforward this guy will plead guilty because theres virtually zero wiggle room when they find images of children in sexually explicit positions on your hard drive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but but but my ebil beech gf hates me and put this on my computer its almost as bad as her spermjacking me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i downloaded some anime and who knew it had cp in it must be a plant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a computer security professional and i could probably do this effectively without getting caught it would take years of knowledge to do this and the amount of people who can do it are small and the people who would do it are like of those people these people are just paranoid what do they suggest removing laws against cp the only reason to do this over drugs or planting guns would be the cost but it cp is legal then thats what people would do instead what idiotic logic is this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,voatco it used to be redditcom but the admins clamped down
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah there is no way to make it look convincing without either implicating yourself or having a lot of access to their computer that they wouldnt extend to you if you hated them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah because the actual act of owning cp is abusing children like this is not just being caught with risque porn fuck this dismissive attitudes to this shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this meme is colin powells greatest achievement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,itd be easier for me to frame somebody for setting up a terroristic plot than possession of child pornography
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,intent to commit a crime
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of these days im going to have to actually figure out how ducks and dolphins reproduce but this cracks me up every time i read it cause holy shit how have white people survived this long
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a feminasty social juicetasty idea to feminize men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously planting drugs is way easier and way more common
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same story from my friends who are prosecutors they dont bother going after the guy unless its gigs and gigs of cp over months and months browser history filesharing history etc no way is someone getting put away over le risky click one time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly dont know why i got downvoted so hard im saying that the linked comment is shit because hes acting like its not as bad as molesting a kid not realizing that kids were abused to get the images the priest had
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or just put a bunch of drugs in their house plenty of things really but reddit loves cp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry i meant that along the lines of whats rape culture or whats consent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you really want to know google it you dont want to know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre being upvoted here the arrows are reversed and downvoting is upvoting actual downvoted stuff has in front of it the minus sign is just a css script
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,constructs of the matriarchy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hahaha that makes sense on mobile i had like and then hopped on my desktop and was at and then again later i was so confused
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ofc my b
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how the fuck is reddit still on about the fucking clock boy holy fucking shit when did it happen how fucking long have they been hating him for jesus fucking christ just fucking stop you stupid fucking pieces of shit sorry had to get that out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can we have someone steal all the pens in the white house after his racist immigration order today fucknugget von kinderhands signed another delightful executive order demanding that for every new federal regulation proposed by a department they must find two to repeal furthermore for the total budget change of implementing and repealing must equal zero i dread to think what regulations will be on the chopping board even worse is according to the new civil rights movement and josh rogin theres a draft bill floating around to rollback the federal protections for lgbt employees obama introduced just try and stay safe out there american srsters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did the admins finally grow a spine adn chose a side that new blog post from alexis is actually pretty cool maybe a bit too patriotic for my taste and its not like theyre banning racist shitholes like thecheeto or raltreich and is like the first time i see at least one of the admins declare himself against trump
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im looking forward to oceans eight cause i loved those movies at least and but i am not looking forward to the hissyfits over the allwoman casting for it just the thread in rmovies for the movie poster today was pretty bad i bet when the trailer comes out theyll all be crying about how its all vagina jokes just because one scene vaguely referenced sex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does anybody find trump always calling everything and everybody he hates low energy rather creepy i mean thats not the only creepy thing about him but still it sounds to me as if he were some cults initiate and now that cults lingo is slipping into his speech just a wild guess of course
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just got approved mod rights for an old creepy candid photo subreddit what should i turn it into
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its because they cant believe that a minority a muslim no less can receive a scholarship from the president theyre super smart lol so they should also be entitled to receive a scholarship they honestly believe that somehow ahmed had anticipated the response from the president and fabricated the whole thing as a means of getting a scholarship
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,teach me your secrets
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im really a little fascinated about how my own views towards republicans are changing the common enemy etc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he literally said all lives matter and then asked people to share stories to ignore the reality of the situation so no business as usual at reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think alexis is going rogue tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,safecracking is an evolutionary trait of men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on the bright side at least more than just romantic comedies are pandering to women now i mean theyre steal artistically decrepit cash grabs but at least movie execs acknowledge we like movies now baby steps also whenever i get mad at the movie industry i just think about fury road and it seems more okay all of a sudden
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on the bright side their overreaction does provide us with hours of laughter ill heat up the popcorn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,perfect lol but in seriousness a former wizards of the coast employee just did a massive magicthemed silent auction to raise money for the aclu and wizards has recently been majorly pushing for diversity and inclusivity including somewhat recently releasing a very well recieved trans character alesha who smiles at death so while the community is still problematic the company behind magic has been trying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cats there arent enough cats on reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,make it pictures of cans dressed up as things with little stories attached like a can dressed in overalls with captions like this can did all the renovations in the house get it can did candid thanks ill show myself out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,things in real life that remind you of voltaires candide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,um hardiman is cancer he has a history of defending white home owners every time housing and urban development tried to build houses defending landlords who were discriminatory against africanamericans looking for apartments and defending evangelists who want to display the ten commandments in a courthouse he is a amendment advocate with no interest in curtailing those rights he loves freeze peach he shut down a federal law that criminalized videos of animal cruelty unless its about breast cancer awareness then hes against it the biggest bit of him being cancer hes a republican what happened to no passing o nominees for the former host of the apprentice trump is illegitimate senator mitch mcturtle refused to do his job to even meet on obamas nominee who was a moderate republican unless trumps nominee swings the court to a leftleaning none of his nominees should be approved
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i remember that part of the constitution it was the real battleground for whether west newcombria would join the union or not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,vdare yet another white supremacist media outlet for those not in the know is already throwing a tizzy about him so he wont be nominated i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a strict constitutionalist which is what scaly proposed himself to be is better than a feels christian terrorist judge i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i can live with that since hes replacing scalia now if rbg and company can hang on thatd be nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funnily enough he never got a scholarship from any us based university or government that was made up on reddit and spread everywhere
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god i hope he starts banning every racist shithole on this website
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah i cant wait for the day an mra says but its unrealistic for women to be criminals and invalidate everything theyve ever said about men being oppressed because muh prison population
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes alesha was amazing perfectly got across the idea that you choose who you are if it wasnt stupidly expensive and the same company pushing inclusivity wasnt also making really bad money grubbing decisions id still be playing now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dogs cats have got other platforms and dogs are underrepresented now fite me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,candid cats and dogs photos i have a lot of pictures of my dog sleeping is that creepy you be the judge p

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reyebleach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,interesting i couldve sworn that he received some sort of scholarship from obama i couldve read the story wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yay another magic player im not sure if thats the best way to phrase it more like learning to accept yourself but yeah alesha was amazing clearly wizards did their homework both on how trans representation works and on just making a badass and interesting character and yeah i miss money lol theres always the pauper format though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he was invited for a tour of the white house and got to meet obama similar for mit he got a tour of the university reddit began spreading that he got a free scholarship for mit paid by the government others began repeating it and now they wont shut the fuck up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can always play for free on cockatrice i know other magic players love to shit on their community and the quality of games there but i have found people generally nicer there than in my lgs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good idea especially dogs and cats happily living together squee intensifies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for the info guess i had my story mixed up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edit yes im no im not for trump leaving a single comment in thedonald doesnt make somebody pro trump glad you creepy fucks went through my post history im used to hillary looking like a fat stump not an average blonde bimbo not everybodys life revolves around politics you should know edit everybodys getting offended up in here edit hey srs i didnt know their was an entire subreddit devoted to being a huge pussy trumps a fat oompa loompa and has a small dick feel better hes unstumpable anyway oh so calling somebody fat or a bimbo is sexist and then it got worse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im so tired of these straights forcing their sexuality down everyones throat its always peenfeels
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only fat stumps are donald trumps fingers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,male politicians whom redditurds dislike his policies are pretty much crap so i cant say i agree with that female politicians whom redditurds dislike is it just me guys or does she not please our collective peens
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reads title jesus thats a little egregious even for roddit it must be just barely over twe hello darkness my old friend ive come to talk with you a gain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres something about teenagers they are half way between a child and an adult in so many ways some of them freeze that way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youve got to ask yourself at that point can he refer to women in ways that dont make him sound like a pig or is feeeemale the height of civility for him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im on the fence about her policies but her face displeases the cispeen to the dumpster with you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for shithead comments fat shaming and misogyny gg no re and the first one doesnt even make sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not pro trump seconds later trump is unstumpable right sure buddy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so in other words hes used to hillary looking like trump s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks op for reminding us that we should never let anything stand in the way of hating a woman you can hate them for being pretty and too ugly we could use more inventive hategeniuses like op in this world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually nancy reagan probably closer resembles a piece of wet beef jerky at this point what the fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im used to hillary looking like a fat stump not an average blonde bimbo in reply to anomalousavocado on im a little disappointed that hillary only clapped and smiled would have been some prime gif material if she did the dance too at utc wrote holy shit thats hillary edit yes im no im not for trump leaving a single comment in thedonald doesnt make somebody pro trump glad you creepy fucks went through my post history im used to hillary looking like a fat stump not an average blonde bimbo not everybodys life revolves around politics you should know edit everybodys getting offended up in here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but what about those gay couples holding hands in public
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i wish he can write better sentences
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,correction male politicians who redditurds dislike cuck cuck cuck cuck cuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,freeze like the peaches they always talk about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i need more to hit bingo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do they think american tourists are any better than any other they arent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on reddit being a rude generalising bigoted dickhead to noneuropean cultures is business as usual
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so basically chinas paradise for redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in china being a rude dickhead is business as usual in reply to silentsandwich on aljazeera reporters go on tour in paris with the chinese tour groups who have joined the notorious club of the worlds worst its called face its basically what chinese culture is all about thats why you can hire people to grieve at your relatives funerals because if not enough people were sad that they passed your family will lose face at utc zedoktar wrote its funny a few asian cultures have that thailand for example is huge on face but in their concept of it being a rude dickhead makes you lose face in china being a rude dickhead is business as usual
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but the question is is it a stereotype or true kinda like the stereotype of french people being assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly kinda true i once saw a video of some crazy guy beating the shit out of a child there and like people walked by and no one did anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why was a white guy running an asian market why was he treating customers so shitty why was he telling us a story to brag about what a great racist he is what is a typical japanese woaaah does he realize that japanese people are human beings and not anime characters basically the message i got was i the superior white man did impress the lowly poc with my intermediate knowledge of their language and they heralded me as an overlord ugfffghhfgggggggh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this story happened i swear on my waifu and hentai collection
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,here you are the foreigner at utc waldotherogue replied to redditors who speak a second language what funny things have you overheard from i used to run an asian market in central mississippi i was a blonde haired blue eyed white guy in a mostly korean store being so close to the nissan plant in canton many of my regulars were japanese guys i spoke proficient japanese at the time a group of guys came in that id never seen before as with all new customers i never assume their ethnicity and greeted them in english they start making their rounds looking up and down the aisles i can hear theyre speaking japanese and looking for pickled radish typically with new customers ill give them some time to explore then check on them and ask if they need help finding anything specific as im walking around from behind the counter i hear one guy suggest asking me where the radish would be just before rounding the corner another says the equivalent of nah that fucking foreigner doesnt know about any of this stuff pocky and ramune lolol while using a pejorative term for foreigner major faux pas i look the guy square in the eye and told him in very informal japanese here you are the foreigner the radish is in the first cooler second shelf under the miso then in more formal do you require any additional assistance all his buddies gave the typical japanese woahhh while the asshat bowed deeply apologizing over and over he went and waited in the van from then on any time that group came into the store and my car was parked out front he stayed in the van httpiimgurcomityvibkpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course the white dude would think gaijin is pejorative
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it basically reads like this person is saying i a humble and heroic white brought down the arrogant uppity asians at their own game i am a genius and a hero worthy of your love and adoration
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is an offense we only use that term when we want to refer to someone as not belonging in our society the proper term is 外国人 gaikokujin
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,typically if you are no longer in an environment where you need the language you lose it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh thanks i knew there was a formal way of saying gaijin but was unsure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no worries its important that you know 外国人 gaikokujin and 外人 gaijin differ by only one chinese character which means country a 外人 is not specified to be from another country 外 means outside so a gaijin is just an outsider someone who doesnt belong which is more than just foreigners its an insult to anyone who is referred to as such
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats highly dependent on the person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,number two there is a natural and biological reason for women to choose certain types of jobs especially caregiving and there is no amount of social engineering than can change it unless it is legally forced same as with men statistically a babys first words are generally mama papa or science is for boys we cant fight these immutable biotrooths
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is false a lot more women work part time and most fields dominated by female workers pay less rtwoxchromosomes at utc suavishomo replied to i am sorry but this is completely false as usually are all the gender pay gap stories in the western world i went to check the study mentioned and no women do not get paid x less than men for the exact same job the two main culprits are always the same and they are mentioned on the study itself a lot more women work part time and most fields dominated by female workers pay less on top of that all of these are averages from all jobs groups shifts etc and not a comparison between tim and anna that work in the same company doing the exact same thing its easy to support something that benefits your group even if it is false but it only makes you look like a biased idiot in the gender pay gap in iceland revealed that a female employee earned on average less than a male employee in this pay difference is slightly higher than the average of in and shows that the high education achievements of women in iceland have not yet fully translated into an equivalent progress of closing the gender pay gap also two main reasons for the gender pay gap in iceland can be identified first the parttime rate of women in iceland is significantly higher than the males parttime rate and thus leads to a lower income of women moreover iceland has a segregated labour market with respect to both sectors and occupations the pay level is generally lower in the femaledominated occupations hence women in general receive less in return on their education and experience than men edit i just woke up what have i done also fixed some spelling mistakes link to the study edit a lot of you are talking about that there is a pressure of society that makes even if indirectly women go to lower paying jobs number one that is a totally different problem than women get paid a lot less than men for the exact same job number two there is a natural and biological reason for women to choose certain types of jobs especially caregiving and there is no amount of social engineering than can change it unless it is legally forced same as with men number three there is a lot of talk of underrepresentation of women in higher paying jobs but somehow there seems to be a complete ignore brush over the fact that men are also overrepresented on some hazardous and low paying jobs such as construction workers maintenance personnel private and public security etc number four society is already heavily encouraging women into men dominated fields but if there is still a small number of them willing to choose that career path what else can society do force them number five and last laws exist regarding this issue you cannot be discriminated in any form due to your gender if that happens it is illegal as mentioned there are many variables that can make the earnings average of all women to be less than the earnings average of all men but legally and technically there is nothing else that can be done since in liberal western countries it all depends on the choices individual women make the only way to fix this nonexisting issue would be to legally force people to certain jobs or enforce quotas with the only factor being their gender to remove the society factors and equalize the average earnings gap that is what gender discrimination is a hell of a slippery slope and simply an attack against free will of individuals edit im seeing a large number of people sending articles and proof that there in fact a wage gap between men and women i am taking a look at them all and have yet to see one that factually proves that solely gender is the cause i will continue to read them as they come edit i would like to thank the user who gave me gold i just wish it was given to a snarky joke i could come up somewhere and not to a post regarding one of the most divisive issues of today regardless and again thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pay gap is false now heres the reason the paygap is true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when do i hear my pronouns when people talk to me or when im in a group of people and we have a conversation this sorta thing happens my dear reddituers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,secondly i might maybe give enough of a fuck about you to learn your name maybe but im certainly not going to put in the time and effort to learn the agonizing details of your neurotic selfidentity and how youre fryingpansexual demiglaise bundtkin who prefers the pronouns doughdoughdoughself especially when doing so would just enable the rest of the mob of snowflakes to use their contrived identities to bully me into submission if they werent treated with extra special love and attention too there is so much straw in that comment we could make a scarecrow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i never hear anyone use my pronouns because i am a smart stem redditor and never leave my bedroom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the pronoun thing is just one way to express the gender that you are we call it pronouns and maybe thats why its so easy for them to handwave but id love to see how these lestem redditors would feel after a whole day of being referred to as miss and she and her someone doing it to me once would be enough for it to give me pause and i imagine it would be for them too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a transgender person i hear fucking assholes who know what gender i want to be called misgender me with the wrong pronouns all the time i hear or see it at least once a day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you dont know what its like to hear someone use your pronouns because nobody wants to talk to you turdburger
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like they either dont talk to anyone ever or theyre so far up their own ass they dont pay attention to what anyone says like damn try listening to people for a change
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only things i know about trans people i gleaned from antitrans copypastas its not like your pronouns represent the way people think of you and their cognitive representation of you theyre literally completely semantically empty placeholders thank god this enlightened stemlord is here to set us straight where would we be without uneducated unknowledgeable opinions on these delicate sociolinguistic issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit whingeing about pronouns in a
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this guy doesnt do much for anyone but himself does he hes so pissed off at the slightest idea of being considerate its one thing to forget someones name but what if i knew your name and just called you jim because i wanted you to be jim sound like something that would annoy you thats basically what you are doing when you ignore someone elses pronoun preference
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know when i hear my own pronouns literally every conversation i have with more than one person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbh in germany we are jealous sometimes that in the english language its just a teacher for whatever gender the teacher has in german and other languages its not just the pronouns ein lehrereine lehrerin ein arbeitereine arbeiterin etc there are several professors and students who complain about gender neutrality even if it doesnt affect them in particular i believe its part of scientific andor academic work to write everything as correct and neutral as possible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh freeze peach ugh fuck rcanada entire thread is poop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow that pissed me off so much that i initially downvoted this thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe if hed leave his basement more than his weekly trip to the store to buy mountain dew and hot pockets
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i called this person by the wrong pronoun they would probably be very annoyed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cispeens are deplorable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this person has never been in a conversation with more than one other person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when do you actually even hear your own pronouns often
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its so fucking easy for them isnt it they have no idea what it feels like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my heart drops when i hear hehim and have to remember sheher is for me id do theythem more but it confuses the straights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do people suck so much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,secondly i might maybe give enough of a fuck about you to learn your name maybe ouch i got a papercut from how edgy that was
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but now that inflammatory political stance is potentially made criminal on the basis of that action being discriminatory it opens you up to criminal prosecution so much for the freedom to express oneself or speak freely what they want to repeal a human rights act based on this how the fuck do they believe their free speech overrides all other human rights the entire point of rights is that they cant be infringed even by other rights also the legislation specifically references hate speech which is difficult to show in court fucking armchair lawyers being totally ignorant of the law and pretending they found a problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when you accidentally reveal the reason you dont care about other people is because you never talk to other people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is so much shit in that thread starting with the fucking title that and the sikh thread somehow managed to lower my already abysmal view of rcanada
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this users top most visited subreddits rmensrights rtheredpill rtwoxchromosomeslol and rmgtow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this obsession with your own pronouns is really narcissistic seriously when do you actually even hear your own pronouns at utc bloodshoteyes replied to first off this obsession with your own pronouns is really narcissistic seriously when do you actually even hear your own pronouns no one sits around talking about you while youre right there in front of them or maybe they imagine that the rest of the world has nothing to do but hang around talking about them behind their back secondly i might maybe give enough of a fuck about you to learn your name maybe but im certainly not going to put in the time and effort to learn the agonizing details of your neurotic selfidentity and how youre fryingpansexual demiglaise bundtkin who prefers the pronouns doughdoughdoughself especially when doing so would just enable the rest of the mob of snowflakes to use their contrived identities to bully me into submission if they werent treated with extra special love and attention too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,besides the when do you ever hear your own pronouns part this dude kinda has a point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like any of them have ever talked to more than one person at once
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when people talk to me when im in a group of people guess they never leave the basement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how they assume that the only people who would care about pronouns would use doughdoughdoughself pretty sure these people exist at a rate of one for million if at all the mob of snowflakes doesnt exist what does exist are trans men and women who are constantly misgendered and if you perceive being asked to use the correct pronouns as being bullied into submission and forced to treat others with extra special love and attention you are an inconsiderate butt full stop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why does he think trans people would want to interact with him in the first place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the irony of the first and second sentences in this paragraph as le predditor complains of narcissism in its opening sentence in the first paragraph what about mah penis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditor guysfiremanetc isnt sexist its gender neutral two seconds later how dare you be gender neutral
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and everyone knows about my cispeen before i walk in the room
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you dont mind me asking whats a stem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyd probably want to punch something because then somebody would be treating them as a feeeeeeeeeeemale the reason folks like this oppose gender equality is because theyre afraid that they might be treated the way they treat women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why would it bother you if gender is merely social bundling of traits iand i believe that myself despite being a conservative catholic and if im secure in my own masculinity then i dont really care if someone calls me she now granted any random person calling me feminine pronouns is probably doing so with hostility and that means i probably dont want their company very much but the actual she part itself isnt really bothersome
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it literally takes effort to do the right thingwhy are people dicks for no reason
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive heard this too im not transgender but ive noticed people will point out that someone wants to be considered a woman and then immediately after mistakenly call them a he and correct themselves or vice versa they have to make sure were all aware they dont really buy this gender choice bullshit like oh sorrry i meant sheeee
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rekt em lol tag em as xe instead its technically using proper pronouns nobody can say were hypocrites and itll really confuse em
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they dont know what its like because theyre so used to hearing their prefered pronouns that they dont even think about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,judging from his previous posts it sounds like this dingus has had a lot of healthy relationships with a whole lotta brauds fundamentaly women lack humility this is the root of their inability to be truly funny behind all the jokes all the routines there remains a poise that is as essential to being a woman as having a vagina that poise denies them the true range of comedy the true ability to be funny sure they can get a laugh every now and then but their inflated dignity will never allow them to be the butt of any jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but what if i knew your name and just called you jim because i wanted you to be jim sound like something that would annoy you thats basically what you are doing when you ignore someone elses pronoun preference sounds like you might be underselling it to me i mean to me it sounds like this guy is going out of his way to make trans people feel unwelcome and thats so much worse than just calling someone jim when they dont want to be called that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rcanada is liberal and progressive my fucking ass
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i understand having a different view on it i dont
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so thats why my monthly srs instructions told me to buy garden shears and a basket were going collecting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is the point that you are benned because you are benned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,eh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh word
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like any of them have ever talked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,respect mpenis and perhaps i might just consider learning thy birth name lowly snowflake 🕵🏻
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a tiny shitlord whats a shitlord a big ol stemlord
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,depends on the type for roses and reddit its green and covered in little pricks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a stem major is someone whos majoring in science technology engineering or mathematics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the main body of an alba amorphophallus minimis plant usually shooting out from the dirt where it belongs with the worms grubs centipedes and other animals of a disgusting nature
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with stem in particular its more of an issue with the arrogance that many stem especially on reddit people have theres quite a few who think their degree makes them smarter and superior to any business humanities social science and liberal arts majors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,s and m teehee are great t and e are vocational school majors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it bothers me for a reason similar to why misgendering bothers trans people gender is a social construct yes gender identity is not however my gender is male and so is my gender identity to address me with feminine pronouns is to disrespect my gender identity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,power for their ego
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because theyre just inherently bad people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im trans and stealthish and whenever i hear that i mentally think thats one more person ill never come out to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but my personal transphobic asshat award winners are the ones whose hatred isnt even thinlyveiled and who get really mad about miscisgendering yeah shes a terrible person its he he he youre pretty much a traitor of the entire species if you cave in to their agenda lol sjws getting mad about pronouns
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i once saw im pretty sure that was the only time ive ever seen it someone using shihir pronouns just because the other persons gender was unknown it was a really cool concept and i wish it would happen more often
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fundamentaly women lack humility sure they can get a laugh every now and then but their inflated dignity will never allow them to be the butt of any jokes ironicat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gender essentialism and a complete inability to understand irony what a winner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,amy schumer acts unpoised during skit she thinks its automatically funny to be raunchy bc shes a female ugggggh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,comedy is based on getting attention and brushing a lot of things off and dude thinks lady comedians cant be funny because theyre not sheepish enough fuck outta here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i never meant to imply anything of the sort though i can see how people get that interpretation from me only mentioning trans men and women obviously people who use theythem or various third gender cultures or genderfluid exist as well as people who are attempting to advance gender abolitionist goals using intentionally odd pronouns and all that jazz there is absolutely nothing wrong with that c after all this is coming from someone who is agender
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im amazed how that joke has persisted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah stem is awesome if some people on reddit sucks thats on them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well stem fields are more difficult in nature
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,calling engineering a vocational school major is pretty absurd i could see an argument for some aspects of the technology part of the acronym but engineering school is pretty damn serious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok i know its subjective i just dont personally have any inherent connection to whether im a he i get why trans people are sensitive to it but i guess i just assumed it was more the people who use heshe maliciously instead of it being a general thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and asserting that over others my view of you is more important than who you are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all it takes is just coming out to one wrong person i pretty much went stealth and only told people i trusted then a year ago i told a specific person i trusted and now he attacks me pretty much everywhere i go mentioning that im transgender to everyone and stalks me now i dont have a choice and im pretty much out to everyone we had a perfectly fine friendship until he found out that i was transgender and now hes made himself my worst enemy like what the fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this fucking projection man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stem is fine in principle and often in actuality its more the stemworshippers who are the issue
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nothings wrong with vocational school engineering is preparing you for a job a vocation science and math are part of a broader liberal arts education
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ew what the fuck thats so gross hugs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,science and math both also prepare you for a job if you get an engineering degree you have pretty much the same process as other fouryear degrees calling an engineering program at a university vocational is misleading and maybe even offensive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to the ruling elites thats a fair price to pay for completely destroying yet another european society theyre getting precisely what they want demographic destruction of the european peoples and complete political control at utc holdtheholohoax replied to to the ruling elites thats a fair price to pay for completely destroying yet another european society theyre getting precisely what they want demographic destruction of the european peoples and complete political control httpiimgurcomegzvyrwpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this falls well below the minimum the comment itself was actually removed and there are several users shitting on him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry when i looked he was top of the thread you couldnt see the votes yet though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a canadian rcanada is so hilariously unrepresentative of my country it almost makes up for how fucking sad that sub is almost
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black people want to be treated equally supremacy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont worry new homeland security dude david clarke will get them how dare they ask not to be shot so much surely they have ties to isis yep that racist african american sheriff from the rnc is now homeland security secretary fun fact he wants to suspend due process and likes sending people to guantanamo indefinitely and he wouldnt stop at protesters either but also anyone who expresses support for them and since i live in america and have supported blm through internet posts before well goodbye i guess ill be in fuckin guantanamo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good peterson can be next that articles pretty obnoxious too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ever considered that it may not be a black supremacist group and that universities are by no means being held hostage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,today i learned that not wanting to be shot at ridiculously disproportionate rates is literally a supremacist view
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why on earth are universities allowing this black supremacist group hold them hostage at utc spencerdrangus replied to that was nauseating to read why on earth are universities allowing this black supremacist group hold them hostage the reddit title is editorialized by the way it isnt blm its blc black liberation collective which have way more skeletons in their closet than blm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id be down for black supremacy tbh white ppl have run the show for so long itd be interesting to see how black ppl shake things up

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think its representative enough most canadians are hardcore liberals that dont care about social justice issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,word that place is horrid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was okay once and then and now its full of hardright pricks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,am i out of touch no no its the protesters who are wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man bill maher is more of a typical liberal than i wanted to admit in my preanarchy days
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,might have something to do with the metacanada sub not sure though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are you taking something said in the circlequeef seriously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,liking your wife to a domesticated animal purely used for sex sounds like a stable relationship
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a trained canadian attack beaver is a funny image so of course reddit has to shit all over it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not demeaning at all s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i call the trained beaver that sleeps next to me wifey in reply to posivius on im canadian so its hard to get guns or other weapons so i just have a trained beaver sleep next to me i call him bitey at utc wrote i just have a trained beaver sleep next to me i call him bitey i call the trained beaver that sleeps next to me wifey
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit has a legendary sense of humor after all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how often do you have sex with actual beavers my good sir
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sexuality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a good comment whys it here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,self proclaimed rape victim explains why false rape accusations arent real at utc cuteghosties replied to rape survivor there are such slim chances of being falsely accused of rape i am so sorry this andy person made this very long winded well written story for you to read i hope you got your popcorn out for it of course hes a screenwriter there are not many girls out there who are gonna call out rape on you for shits and giggles its not a fun situation the whole falsely accused bs makes it so much harder for those of us who have gone through the situation to come forward and tell someone what happened i never told the police what happened to me as for your question i think what you meant to ask was if im having sex with a girl and she says stop and i dont want to and then she says im raping her then do i stop the answer is if youre having sex with anyone and they say i dont want to have sex you stop touching them immediately these scenarios never happen i promise you they are lies made up by male celebrities to cover up horrible behavior httpiimgurcomiyhztrapng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is ludicrous linking a month old thread and the person you linked to is in the negatives you do realize that youre like calling on people to brigade a post that cant even be voted on because you disagree with it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah the response to the comment was awful which i guess is what you were drawing attention to for a sec i was worried you thought the comment itself was shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im so naive haha i genuinely thought they were trying to highlight the negative response the linked comment got right up until i was told to hang myself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no i was right there with you you asked the question i would have asked their answer sounded legit and then they exploded into that weird ragey rant super confusing and pretty unsettling mras are seriously some kind of powerful stupid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,male on male rapeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,minieffort for the worst ones secret codes are cool ed also adding which actually got heavily downvoted for being a little too onthenose but garnered which is just ridiculously nonsensical enough for me to include it here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry for not linking a single comment directly thanks for taking the effort
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its cool i like dumpster diving
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,welp her value as a feeeeemale has been diminished by someone elses peen tarnished goods plenty of more obviously desperate women in their out there for your peen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is low even for reddit tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im just going to crawl up into a ball and cry now how fucking devoid of empathy do you have to be to think like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the shit either shes been abused or shes lying either way lol fuck that bro thats awful but what really gets me is why is it low unless op truly has feelings for her there is no reason for him to emotionally invest himself in this he shouldnt be obligated to stay with someone just because they have mental problems and hes not in the wrong for leaving if he considers that too much baggage unless op truly has feelings for her theyve been together for a fuggin year dude and it probably hasnt been easy i think maybe he truly does
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,usually stuff on this sub is just straight white people being dumb this is actually stomach churning disgusting how can anyone say this and not hate themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,psa that sub should come with a hazard warning going you will get actual advice eventually but also have a chance of getting caught up in the game of who wants to come across as jaded the harder as to the link just there are no words
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah victim blaming the rational responsetm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you srs for reminding me that not everyone is like this type of person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,either way what are you doing with her because mentally ill people deserve to be loved too and theres nothing wrong with loving someone who is an abuse victim jesus christ dude on the whole rlegaladvice seems to be one of the more reasonable places on reddit but i was rather surprised at the number of wtf comments on this particular post
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean ive read and seen a lot of sick and fucked up shit but a man sexually forcing himself on his daughter on a regular basis since she was a child and the rest of the family too struck by fear to do anything about it actually made me feel fucking sick how the hell can someone have the fucking guts to reply in such a heartless vile fashion im beyond belief the fucking patriarchy runs so deep in our society and is shames me as man that there are still other men who defend and exploit that disgusting system rant over but im still so disgusted i actually feel like puking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my girlfriend was psychologically abused by her father here entire life earlier this year he beated her shes deeply depressed and having suicidal thoughts regularly yes shes broken but that doesnt mean she doesnt need affection and love i would say she needs it now more than ever with that said reading that shit made me feel like punching that piece shit he can take his lack of empathy and choke on it until he dies the pieces of shit that upvoted can die too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or she is a deeply deeply damaged person whose father never did any of those things and she needs intense therapy and you need to stay out of it except for helping her get the therapy she desperately needs literal gaslighting in the comments
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a cold piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit leads me believe that its time we brought the pillory back into fashion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my girlfriend has been sexually assaulted by her father for her whole life either way what are you doing with her there are plenty of stable sane years olds out there for you to date at utc avadavid replied to two possibilities this actually happened and you are dealing with a hopelessly broken person this is of course sad but really nothing positive will happen to your life by being involved with her just as likely shes damaged for other reasons and the reason she doesnt want you to go to the police is that she is making this up either way what are you doing with her there are plenty of stable sane years olds out there for you to date httpiimgurcombtxoxykpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even if i justve been semiactively lurking in reddit for two weeks i already had that thousandyard stare nothing in reddit surprised my anymore not even rtheredpill or rincelheaven
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,statistically devoid enough to be a redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,incels have terrifying beliefs but they are a fringe of a fringe and probably the most hated group on reddit seriously any time anything about them crops up anywhere the response is a mixture of revulsion and derision mainstream reddit accepts a lot of terrible beliefs but incelibacy isnt pne of them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when youre a redditor and havent told anyone youre a victim in minutes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that persons username is crookedhillary so im not surprised they hate women edit oh boy this user is amazing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i also enjoyed i dont intuitively understand what that means like no shit asshat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyve been together for a fuggin year dude and it probably hasnt been easy i think maybe he truly does perhaps they assumed she was a plate he was spinning because men are incapable of empathy or human relations according to redpillian terms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how can you be in a relationship for a year and have no feelings towards the other person or even think thatwtf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty much except its always the feeemales who are lying case in point this top thread boyfriend takes dog to vets miles away to be put down while woman is away for the day vets scan the chip and call her to pick up her perfectly healthy dog thread is at least comments saying on the basis of no further information that shes probably lying and crazy and the dog was sick and needed to be put down
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously that sub is terrible they really need better moderation to meet the goal that it was set out for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a feeling that rlegaladvice is not actually consists of paralegal just a bunch of redditors that pretends they know something about law source law graduate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that second one was a new one on me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literally though just had someone tell me the other day that empathy isnt real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,incels are just so depressingi honestly just feel sorry for them theyll never have a meaningful connection with another human being
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and something about relationships with no experience so many of the recommendations are to break up and get a lawyer at the smallest suspicion of wrong doing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,go ahead click it i doublewolfdared you i never get my sanity back after lurking on that sub never came back as the same person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am reminded of the metalocolypse episode where the one guy doesnt think religion exists not that its not valid that it doesnt exist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i didnt feel they were actively dangerous to women id agree with you its really sad to have everyone hate you because of your shitty toxic personalityv
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i honestly just feel sorry for them better than they deserve
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just read the titles and the saintelliot name was a little disturbing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just found this right off the bat welp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,superhuman sex i dont know how to or care enough to get my partner off so her desires are unreasonable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rfemalesandgentlemen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the female orgasm is a myth s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if inappropriate jokes were reasons for termination the entire it crew most of the service center reception and call center wouldve been fired so hard wed never find work again at utc replied to bruh i used to work in tech support and mouse in norwegian is mus which is also slang for vagina similarly to pussy in english if inappropriate jokes were reasons for termination the entire it crew most of the service center reception and call center wouldve been fired so hard wed never find work again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and the workforce would be better for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,beat me to it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it makes me ridiculously excited that you replied to one of my comments for some reason i guess its the memes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what an uplifting comment they should just rename the sub to fuck everyone happier than me also i like how their side bar has a rule forbidding cynicism that isnt even enforced
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can people not even get married without reddit hating them heartless bastards
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit hated women so much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone is just as awful as me also cynicism makes you look smart right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the lady is aware of her husbands terminal illness and she is taking the risk willingly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats with all of these detriments improvements to reddits content must be summer in the northern hemisphere
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because only trump and other republicans have unlocked the cheat code divorce theres nothing exploitative in this story its two people currently in love and in a tragic situation wanting to express that the future is unwritten if he survives they may live happily more or less which is all anyone can hope for or they may fall out love and thats why separations and divorce are still legal either way none of us can say for sure what will happen so the only reason to judge is being a bitter arsehole aka a redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know a lady whose husband has ms makes u think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,empathy cant be sold or fucked so whites have no use for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the fuck reddit what is wrong with you cant people do something nice for the people they love without you shitting on them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edgy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know im going to get hell for this liar you got a massive hard on at the idea of being the contrary prick who confuses cynicism with insight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in response to a story about a teen with bone cancer marrying his high school crush even if the guy survives what kind of relationship would it end up basically a woman resenting a man for trapping her into a marriage with a terminal disease i guarantee it at utc lostseahawk replied to ill likely be crucified for this but i think this is horrifying that girl is going to be ruined for the rest of her life nothing like a decision you make when youre to effect the rest of the years you have even if the guy survives what kind of relationship would it end up basically a woman resenting a man for trapping her into a marriage with a terminal disease i guarantee it its weird to me that things like this are celebrated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is basically a disney villain edit or voldemort
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just more people resentful of love like i can see myself thinking like this when i was but at least i grew up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a meaningful relationship with another human being is something redditors will never be capable of having so of course they shit on love its something their stunted brains will never understand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean its actually one of the things i expect reddit to hate people for dont forget that truecels exists on this site
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hates
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is basically a disney villain edit or voldemort he who must not be named
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they do experience love to an extent but a cat is no replacement for human affection
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats true i ought to keep that in mind
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im on my phone and it autocorrects things from right to wrong my bad i guess that is more important than the message
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,excuse you my cats are the perfect substitute for a girlfriend
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,doggies are full of fur and love tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or their right hand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i steal your threequarter eaten cheddar sandwich do you have the right to shoot me yes wow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it comes down to a whole bunch of shallow throwaway lines like systemic injustice which have no basis in reality omg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why would you kill a kid though like what moral high ground is that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the systemic injustice done to the aboriginal people is why there is a disproportionate amount of criminal activity in these communities im not saying your wrong but the issue is so much more complex than just dont be a little shit if you imagine growing up in their environment and feeling like you are on the fringe of society your whole life then you may understand why some may act out we need to be more understanding and much more needs to be done to change things then to just speak hate actual context and empathy classic leftwing word salad attempt at a witty response
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a moral imperative to defend your property that kid took a calculated risk and paid for it wow thank god we have an enlightened sir to cut through all the race baiting regressive virtue signalling and feelingbeforerealing and deliver some logic and reasontm by way of cold hard facts seriously though do people actually believe killing over something like this is a moral imperative tbh id definitely have hit the kid a few slaps but taking someones life over a bike is patrick batemanlevel
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white male kids do it theyre just going through a natural stage of development anyone else does it they deserve to die it enrages me that white dudebros on reddit just completely lack any sort of retrospection in these issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why dont these redditors stop acting like little shits who think they can do whatever the fuck they want
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lets say a government decided that the penalty for theft would be death would this person support it would they say well if they didnt steal they would be alive or would they see it as a barbaric punishment that doesnt fit the crime i would guess the latter because thats what it is so why is it different in this scenario if you want people to take responsibility for what theyve done then how about you expect the murderer to take responsibility for his murder instead of acting like it was justified theft is not justification for murder and of the two murder is worse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,raustralia appears to be a highly progressive sub until aboriginal people are mentioned when it turns into people calling for a second stolen generation this is just after systematic torture of aboriginal children in detention centers was discovered theyre still claiming racism has ended
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so now theyre saying the poor lad stole a motorcycle thats not what people i know from kalgoorlie have said they said it was a scooter and it had parts missing and didnt work and that it didnt even belong to the guy redditors like doing mental gymanstics to justify killing kids
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry but the punishment for stealing isnt death unless you live in saudi arabia or something permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply terraorbem points hours ago if you break the law do you deserve to die no but you do assume all the risks of breaking said law including vigilante retaliation thats a choice not something that was shoved unto his shoulders without his permission okay next time i see a white man jaywalking im going to punch them in a throat it was their choice after all i was betting whether this came from canada or australia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why dont these whites stop acting like little shits who think they can steal whatever the fuck continent they want
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,property status protected holy shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white kid gets a month for possession of hardcore drugs this is an injustice that must be resolved rehab not punishment black kid gets killed for stealing a bike this is legitimate justice he deserved death as punishment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white privilege doest exist right s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why dont these aboriginal kids stop acting like white cishet males
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,absolutely the guy probably rode the bike to work probably used to to go down to the shops and go spend money and this is on top of the market value of the bike this kid was already a drain and his prospects werent looking too good so yea both societally and monetarily this bike had more value but ill give you what your looking for and say it wasnt necessarily ethical to kill him no somebody kill me please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you going to say this and not white dudes should stop murdering aboriginal kids the whole murder thing is pretty fucked up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry thats not how the real world works if all the people on these stolen continents were stronger they would have won and taken over europe the only thing victims are good at is being victimised the world eats the weak and this is true for both humanity and the rest of the animal kingdom theres only billion white people in the world out of billion total well that takes the cake for the most racist comment ive ever seen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,capitalism and colonialism are plauges that need to be stricken from the earth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this represents the view of a frightening amount of australians its ok to be racist towards indigenous australians because you know they dont exactly try to help themselves anyway not how i feel by any means but anyone who has spent time in australia knows its representative of how the majority think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,step look at a history book
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre right whites stole several continents kill them all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why dont these aboriginal kids stop acting like little shits who think they can do whatever the fuck they want at utc replied to heres an idea that will blow some minds why dont these aboriginal kids stop acting like little shits who think they can do whatever the fuck they want mind blown dare i say if he didnt steal this guys motorbike which is kind of a bad thing to do and against the law hed still be alive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but racism only exists in america right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate white people lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is what ancaps actually believe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jesus christ thats grand theft auto the game not the crime logic right there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know what systemic injustice is and am afraid to have my worldview challenged in any sort of meaningful way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is generational trauma for please alex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it must be nice to believe in that reality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxbmyosnpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,throwaway lines literally no academic evidence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like what moral high ground is that whitness if an aboriginal person did this to a white kid they would be call for their heads
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,classic leftwing word salad which basically translates to im a complete dumbass who has no semblance of nuance or understanding of socioeconomics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,empathy sold whites use etc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,implying property rights are a moral imperative wut
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh property
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,propertyhuman lives always
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey ryan lochte was just a kid making a mistake too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well its different because they benefit from kyriarchal systems and are given a free pass for being little shits as such they arent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but but free speech
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,apparently thats only allowed for fragile white dudes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine the uproar if downloading movies or vidya was punishable by murder sorry you nerds assumed the risk when you wanted to be pretend pirates
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,much like rcanada too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i used to always think americans were the most blatantly racist white people then i went to australia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting downvoted youre correct
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors like doing mental gymanstics to justify killing minority kids ftfy lets face it if a minority adult killed a white kid in the same exact situation these same justice nerds would be up in arms and boston bombing doxxing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel like there is a difference between jay walking and grand theft auto
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stealing a bike punishable by death stealing an entire continent actually its good and you should thank me for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the world eats the weak then he should be totally fine with being shot for his stuff in an alleyway or being blown up by terrorists as im sure he thinks is an imminent threat or does that only work one way white people being barbaric the world eats the weak too bad thats life get good at committing violence nonwhite people being barbaric just like a savage to resort to violence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,australia is a racist country thats how successive australian governments continue to get elected whilst putting brown refugees in literal concentration camps even after the un calls it torture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,irc wasnt there a time when you could likehunt aboriginals in australia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no its a gross violation of the non aggression principle you are justified in demanding another burger however
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre saying all the right things to me comrade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he basically admitted to total socioeconomic illiteracy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your brain on capitalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,murder just make it a crime with a substantial fine and they would be up in arms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,naw rcanada is only progressive economically socially theyre as racist sexist and fucked up as lots of the defaults
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have to assume you went to queensland or something australias racism is about on par with canadas for the most part actually raustralias racism is about on par with rcanadas i think what is it about national subs that turns them into whirling shitholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its at
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its no coincidence batman is a rich white dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seize the means of karma production
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the black people of australia were indeed once classified as wildlife in a similar vein the scottish were once acceptable targets for longbow practice by the english i believe the law still exists its just nobody would dare enforce it and getting rid of it publicly would look so so bad i am not a lawyer though so shaker of salt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah some just think that regulations are dumb and everyone knows you can trust a company not to pollute the earth cause thats not in their best interest it definitely makes sense that a capitalist would take time and money to properly dispose of hazardous materials even though no one would know that the increase in cancer or birth defects were directly linked to a year old chemical dump and a company that went away a decade ago its not like thats ever happened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,notallrandroids ellipsesarecruisecontrolforsmart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love it when you talk dialectically to me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pfft all i need is blurry jpegs copypasta and journal articles that ive never actually read
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i still cant see phrases like this without instantly picturing hammy wesker
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no they would be down in armchairs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity mdashyeats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,really maybe my res is fucked its showing as
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,idea for new genre superheroes but instead of fighting crime they fight social injustice basically like anarky before his writer drank the objectivist kool aid but in a universe without super cops like the flash and green lantern edit alright now im really thinking about this and i think it could work set it around the turn of the century so its at the start of the pulp hero era and its during a time when there was a lot of social upheaval and volatility there can be a bunch of heroes who interact with different aspects of social justice of the era im seeing workers unionassociated heroes such as red dawn internationale and southern cross who defend striking workers against hoards of henchmen hired by the managers suffragist heroines im drawing a blank for these because mystique and a league of their own are already things fighting for the right to vote a feud between black cultural nationalists like the members of the talented ten and black nationalists like black star actually feuds between heroes could work across the board sewer socialist heroes who follow the law and try to work inside the system butting heads with marxist vigilantes black feminist heroines struggling for recognition within feminists superhero teams and unionist superheroines being excluded from workers teams and then of course we have the supervillains all designed in the vein of the red skull a highranking klansman with the mystical power to give his hatred physical form as allburning fire an industrialist with an army of hired henchmen and steel security automata built by the hands of the very people theyre being used on and one very special automaton that serves as his personal valet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id be so hyped im not sure id be able to chill
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry shouldve clarified progressive economically insofar as they support guaranteed minimum income and public healthcare
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats the css every comment has a in front of the score
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you might enjoy for a collective superhero
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive also met many that are very into environmentalism and social justice it all comes down to the individual that may be true but the ideology is fundamentally at odds with environmentalism and likely social justice thats pretty much all ill say to avoid fighting but pm if you want to carry on this conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,psyduck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats the first thing you will do in communism for me itll be nonalienated useful labour stoned on some dank community weed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dat flair tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that sounds infinitely more exciting than rich white man plays with weapon suit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that sounds excellent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah for sure still capitalism always capitalism eternally capitalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,beyond parody
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fetishizing creeps
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,having sex with a deaf girl is my ultimate goal because the screams they make are raw and unfiltered and they cant hear themselves so they wont be self conscious ftfy you neckbeard creep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this should be the next thing mark hamill reads in the jokers voice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who finds that funny other than a batman villain seriously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the worst part is that i dont think this is a rape joak thats fucking terrifying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,having sex with a deaf girl is my ultimate goal because the screams they make are raw and unfiltered and they cant hear themselves so they wont be self conscious at utc replied to having sex with a deaf girl is my ultimate goal because the screams they make are raw and unfiltered and they cant hear themselves so they wont be self conscious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dude should use his imagination for better purposes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because hes an absolute disaster like united airlines flight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even batman villains dont really go for the sexual crimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a tucker max fan at the start of his critically panned film tucker max is having sex with a deaf girl when the police show up because neighbours had called about the screams
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why how
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because if it was a shitty rape joak at least you could call it a shitty joak my point is that i think these guys actually think a woman screaming during sex is totally normal and natural like what normal human being thinks i wonder if deaf women would scream louder when i sleep with them thats fucking creepy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i read it similarly like in a le big dick makes them scream way because if reddit wants to make a rape joak they wont be subtle about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,idk from my experience dicks can make ya scream while you still enjoy it doubt thatd be their case tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,k
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i have a question before your inevitable benning and deletion why the fuck did you think advertising your platform which will inevitably used by the rapists racists and paedophiles we oppose here would in any way be a good idea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah ok so you are willfully creating a platform to enable predators cool enjoy finding out how effective your legal disclaimer is

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is the point of comments like this i mean in this format
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are you asking that when no one here accused the guy father of being a pedo why are you asking us when the pedo comment is in the original thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not a zealot but people who question free speech for any reason whatsoever should be burnt at stake free speech is good because its good it just is thats all that you need to know make criticism of free speech illegal

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have saved this pic and i now regard you as a treasure thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbh i didnt even know how to do it on desktop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is classic identity politic bullshit at utc cuckberg replied to this is classic identity politic bullshit trump lost trump is a moron the genderrace of the people he yelled at are relevant he would have yelled at literally anyone on stage this is now the batshit crazy article from fusionnet ive seen here in the last hour httpiimgurcomfnndbicpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,she absolutely does not want any consequences to any of her actions in life ironicat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so the kkk has free speech and i would die to protect it so you better not physically attack them if they come to your neighborhood and advocate for genocide against you woman talked back to her harasser punch the slur
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,buti just wanna say stuff that sounds racist or sexist youre taking away muh freeze so awful the comments in the video obviously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one might see the video and see a person being sexually harassed using the methods available to her to fight back or one may consult reddit barely paraphrasing she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she should be assaulted she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she should be sexually assaulted she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she is a professional victim she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she wants to be a victim she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore her motivation is money she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she wants to live consequencefree she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore i can tell definitively that she has never had consequences she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore false rape accusations are common she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore slurs are mandatory she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore srs brigades she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore the idea of patriarchy is a joke she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she is creating the problem she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she is unstable unclever and crazed she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she is making a big deal unnecessarily she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore the best joke would be to do it again she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she doesnt understand reality she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she doesnt care about the true victims like i do she didnt passively permit sexual harassment therefore she is a buzzkill because its cool dontchaknow i feel like theres no end to the excusesexplanations and blaming i guess expecting said excuseexplanationvictimblaming to be clever or original might be too much to expect but otherwise its par for the shit course
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this girl wants to get punched in the face at utc biznizzpantz replied to this girl wants to get punched in the face
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill be downvoted to hell for saying the truth but
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy male here literally all i ever think about is dominating every feminist i see on the internet theyre basically asking for it amirite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought people only used projectors in schools or meeting rooms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats ironic because redditors are the ones who let their kinks influence their behavior in public
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the real point that these fucks are missing is that those of us who do generally want that stuff want it because it was negotiated and consensual i saw a great quote recently to describe a lot of kink relationships its a power exchange not a power grab
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh and if she passively permits sexual harassment that means she cant be raped because she didnt say no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can only find truth in logic if you have already fond truth without logic well played everyone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what makes you think most men dont want to know what their partner enjoys what makes you think most kinky sex isnt fully consensual do you know how much consensual kinky sex is happening at this very second versus nonconsensualrape i fail to see how you feel its accurate to imply that most men that are interested in domination want to rape their partners thats ridiculous like where does that assumption even come from
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not sure they think mussolinis italy was really that bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hes a loser for making that joke in the first place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dinobenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what thats not what i was saying at all i was implying the quoted redditor is a shitheel who doesnt understand consent i know damn well that most kink stuff is consensual i fail to see how you feel its accurate to imply that most men that are interested in domination want to rape their partners thats ridiculous like where does that assumption even come from it sure doesnt come from anything i said
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whyd you post it here theres nothing wrong with that post besides being ridiculously stupid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nice reddit reference ® bro i think its about pokemon right xd keep being awesome and have an upvote p in reply to adminus on a wild tag has appeard actions at utc militron wrote nice reddit reference ® bro i think its about pokemon right not as cool as narwhals baconing at midnight tho xd keep being awesome and have an upvote p
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mods mods
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,read the sidebar itll give you an idea of what this subreddit is for rshitpost would probably be better for the comment you linked to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are white people prone to violence i always hear about crazy stuff like this with white people like the holocaust and trump rallies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you dont hear about whites because you dont want to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i always hear about crazy stuff like this with black people maybe you should look to browsing websites other than stormfront you know try something new for once
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just jaqing off asking an innocent question here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httprationalwikiorgwikijustaskingquestions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait till they find out even africans can be white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are white americans prone to violence i always hear about crazy stuff like the trail of tears
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are african americans prone to violence i always hear about crazy stuff like this with black people at utc replied to are african americans prone to violence i always hear about crazy stuff like this with black people httpiimgurcomxvwaohnpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i usually refer to it as jaqing off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so basically what im seeing is a well done situation where the gunman is anticipating her hence why she runs as he points the gun at her so she leaves maybe warning people in the process though this might not be the case since nobody moved until the punch was thrown the gunman now thinks hes in the clear but really theres a dude out of sight who can get him by surprise and disarms him seems pretty much like its a plan but no reddits gotta make a joke about the woman not being man enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,balls vs no balls figuratively and literally at utc persiandoc replied to balls vs no balls figuratively and literally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey there i think you meant to reply to me i would say youre intentionally being dense but it looks like you actually might be dense either way yeah youre right im certain her job description is to throw customers between her and the threat id have to read her job description to know for sure but after hiring security many times for events ive realized that its commonly multi layered and it very possibly is in her job description to not engage physical threats she could have gotten in the way of the guy around the corner where that literally is his job description and she could have lost her job because of it this gif really shines a light on people who just want to hate women judging some of the in i think that might be the type of person you are her reaction was perfect and if it was a guy instead his reaction would have been perfect they are not paid to charge a gunman who walks through the door and points a gun at them their job description is to check ids and keep under the occupancy limit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah youre completely misunderstanding security shes not hired to protect against violence that position she is in is there to check ids and keep the establishment within their occupancy limit the guy around the corner without the security tshirt on is the enforcer or bouncer hes the one that will physically remove someone and is paid more due to risk involved to jump into dangerous situations he doesnt wear the big flashy tshirt so he can blend in more and its not immediately clear if hes walking toward someone what hes doing actually she handled it perfectly she had a gun pointed at her and her reaction alerted the bouncer who stopped the threat anyone can be security enforcers are typically from military or law enforcement backgrounds
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,told
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what makes you think you understand this situation at all you show very little awareness to any kind of information
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for the record i just reported you for using white knight unironically lol anyway ignore your comment you seem to be struggling to comprehend what is going on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck off forever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yet nobody cares when a news article has to specify that a suspect is a black or a middle eastern male
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because your sex and race dont matter until it can be used against you wait are they finally starting to understa but only if youre white and male oh for fucks sake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not white im normal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean its true i could have told you just from the title
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white males seem to get offended all the time they should just grow a thicker skin
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre frothing at the mouth about this while the article contains this lovely statement in his video peterson suggests the overrepresentation of social justice warriortype activists in government may have impacted the tabling of legislation noting also our current premier kathleen wynne is lesbian in her sexual preference
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,damn qalunaat how hard life is for the white on the continent he stole in the nation he built on the blood and suffering of others where all laws and customs favor him by weight of violence slavery and exploitation the white adhering fanatically to his barbaric religions of conservatism capitalism and christianity is in dire need of civilizing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how in the article they need to specify he is a white male at utc replied to i love how in the article they need to specify he is a white male httpiimgurcomcwqzkalpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,probably old too not that being old is a requirement noted racist website redditcom has a average age in the teens when correcting for reporter bias
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive seen people get real pissed when articles dont specify if a suspect is black or middle eastern
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,soooo friggin close they stood at the edge of awareness and betterment and then they threw themselves off said edge with almost admirable gusto
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i laugh because whites are not normal funny joak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you missspelt black males
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why dont they just say hes black
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please tv tell me whom to hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep i see this all the time in the comments well i guess were too pc and cant say this persons race but nobody saw nuffin anyway its so fucking gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,political correctness gone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ironic how you talk about men having more rational ideas than women yet you still wrote this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,drphil
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wut
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the next post you made before this one was on a porn subreddit so youll masturbate to women and then insult them go be alone and untouched somewhere else
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this a protolmbo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so this is the great comedy reddit tells me happens when they have their precious freeze peach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,welcome to reddit middle school
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like using gay as an insult isnt the most homophobic thing in the world that people do but its still a fucking pain and you cant deny it has an effect im pretty sure the reason im still questioning my sexuality now is because for a long time i never felt i could consider being into the same gender i went through secondary school being told that its okay to be gay but when you hear people calling things they dont like gay it makes that hard to believe deep down a lot of kids must hae had it a lot worse than me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a pathetic little boy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rimbrogressiveandthisisfunny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no guys dont you see he totally turned the joke around by saying gay again this is some wonderful comedy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in response to someone reprimanding op for using gay as an insult yeah honestly its pretty gay when people do that in reply to nonameshere on gotta love when people still use gay to mean bad at utc alertsnow wrote yeah honestly its pretty gay when people do that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love the if homosexuals were serious about it argument like what now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man not rocket league i thought this community was pretty cool they even called the poor bot a faggot in all seriousness its like people dont hear themselves when they say this kind of stuff or in this case type it out its so edgy especially faggot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit middle school you say as if reddit were that mature upper elementary at best really
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,upper elementary they still think farts and shit are funny mentally theyre maybe in kindergarten
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id do it when a redditor moves in thats for sure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gay muslims dont real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,powerful politician vice president elect of the us and former governor with proven antilgbt convictions a random muslim person clearly these two are exactly the same
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if they were dickweeds campaigning with conservative orgs to have my well being assaulted via reduction of access to healthcare etc then yes if anjam chowdry were moving in next door you bet i would be a lot more boisterous about my queerness if the little family that i see walking around the park in veils sometimes moved next door i would give zero shits there isnt any beef between me and random muslim people its people who go out of their way to be dicks and knowingly systemically fuck with me that i have a problem with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not to mention ofc that muslims in america are more lgbttolerant than evangelicals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a difference between some random guy that follows a religion and a politician who legit wants to defund aids research in favour of conversion therapy trumpets and libertarians love to laugh at the lgbt community for not liking tp but they actively want to deny them their existence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like everyone but saying gay people have more to fear from protestants than muslims is fucking laughable obv i cant say everyone in my town is protestant specifically but theres a christianflavor church on about every damn corner and uh two mosques in neighboring towns so i think my fear and uncertainty when i go outside with my partner is not because of muslims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if one of them was openly hateful towards lgbt and was the next vpyeah they would lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is so much wrong with that comment im questioning humanity because someone paid money to say how much they liked it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know the hitler comparison is hackneyed but come on demonizing a race for all the countrys problems deflecting any criticism by saying those guys are worse sound familiar
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes id like to think they absolutely would or any group pence wants to destroy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on people hanging rainbow flags when mike pence moved to their neighborhoodi wonder if theyd do this when a muslim moves into the neighborhood at utc wakkkaflakaflame replied to i wonder if theyd do this when a muslim moves into the neighborhood httpiimgurcomuefebstpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like reddit doesnt understand power dynamics like pence is a powerful politician who has passed laws that hurt lgbt community some muslim guy down the street does not have the power that pence does
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but islam is not a race even i am not thinking of albanians or indonesians when i talk of muslims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and your point is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and also its known and confirmed that pence is homophobic you would in all likelyhood have no idea if the muslim guyfamily down the street has a problem with gendersexual minorities
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,furthermore if that affluent muslim doctor did have a problem with gay people its impossible to oppose his view on homosexuals while affirming his right to his faith its all or nothing around here folks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hi everyone ive lurked here for a long time and i finally have something i feel qualified to speak on that i feel passionate about and thats cosplay ive been doing it for about half a decade now and a large amount of cosplayers that ive met do exclusively male crossplay and genderswapped characters some of whom are gay or bi and two off the top of my head that are trans and they are very open about the fact that cosplay gave them an outlet for exploring that aspect of themselves while encouraging them to develop their skills ive even heard through acquaintances that it saved their life im not saying that the community doesnt have serious problems but in my opinion this is a kind of unique good that cosplay can offer to people and itd be a disaster if a similar policy were to be enforced in the states too also though it shouldnt matter and whether or not this is merely coincidence is beyond me they are phenomenal cosplayers and designers i mean really really good i dont know much about the scene in tokyo but if its anything like here theres going to be some significant talent loss they may well be shooting themselves in the foot with this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so close to having empathy for somebody slightly different than them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,swing and a miss
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yikes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god im so glad im just a casual watcher of anime and not a you know an obsessed fan that community seems toxic as hell for trans people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love me some anime especially anime with cute gender ambiguous characters im personally a big fan of hideyoshi as a label its a shame that the community can be so fucking toxic though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,japanese convention bans male crossplay reddit attempts to care about trans people but what about people who like identify as you know what im not even getting into that at utc replied to but what about people who like identify as you know what im not even getting into that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep i only visit ranime on occasion but i had a momentary lapse in judgement and opened that thread hilarious attack helicopters and other transphobic shit everywhere brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,transphobic and full of pedos too anime was a mistake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love anime but i admit that the industry has some problems like there insistence of adding loli characters in their shows
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair that can be said about literally any hobby or ideology the community will always be toxic for trans people or any other minority hell even the trans community itself can be toxic for them from trutrans stuff to denial of privilege to being reactionary just let them say mean things to us we cant change anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep tried to be civil in explaining why its transmysoginistic history bothers me on one of their thread got accused of something called virtue signaling which as far as i can tell isnt a real thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,chock full of incest apologists too the anime fandom is shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,basically the new altright version of whiteknighting because altruism is dead people are only nice for points social justice is pandering or something i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also see
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if the gynocracy were to ban all anime i would not shed any tears
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think that applies to pretty much any fandom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,incest apologists like rape or consensual incest is there something inherently bad about incest that i didnt know about genuine question
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whiteknighting means you say something insincerely to get laid virtue signaling means that youre insincerely supporting a position in order to fit in with others point is nobody sincerely disagrees with their viewpoint youre either doing it for ulterior motives or because youre a shill its inconceivable that they might possibly be wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this exactly ufatsqueek virtue signaling is basically a more academicsounding less verbose term for you disagree with me so obviously youre doing so disingenuously because theres no way that somebody could actually have a different opinion than me im always right you havent ever heard of the term before because its not used in social justice circles but rather in circles where social justice is hated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah ive been in lots of fandoms and none are ever as bad as weebs tend to be
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if youre actually interested in learning ask this question in one of the subs that arent circlequeefs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is there something inherently bad about incest bye kickbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,steven universe is the only anime i need
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that a weird way of saying cory in the house
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,odd way of saying cory in the house but ok
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because one of the first rules of basic human decency is dont let people starve if you can at all help it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im convinced this person doesnt have a soul or the person who gilded them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not only is a lack of compassion ubiquitous on reddit its celebrated some assclown saw this noeffort shitpost and thought hmm i agree with this so much im gonna buy a super upvote imagine if theyd instead sent that to i dunno a charity for refugees the amount of money redditors spend gilding shitty ignorant toxic posts could probably put a sizable dent in caring for the least among us rather than lining the coffers of this fuckforsaken landfill of a site that lets these shitsucking dildos slap each other on the back with imaginary internet medals brd motherfuckers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what kind of people would we be if we didnt try to help others in need i cant even imagine what its like to try to run away from war its a terrible situation to be in these are not rational arguments these are emotions redditcfg and now let me tell you about the oppression of white men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well here we are in the century and we are seriously asking why we should have to take care of people fleeing for their lives from fucking warzones we are holding a debate on basic human decency as if there are two morally equal sides should we take care of them or march them back to their potential doom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funds and arms terrorist groups in said countries organises violent revolt against stable government starts civil war killing hundreds of thousands bombs all infrastructure to the ground turns entire cities to rubble all whilst stealing natural resources and providing means for governments to be corrupt why cant they fix their problem themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hope these people existing is just another phenomenon of and not an actual part of humanity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like are they so against the concept of priviledge that they cant notice the most obvious blatent and well agreed on kinds
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that sub is cancer the comments are cancer and the people are cancer so many angry little boys have commented at me anytime i say something like human life is a good thing they are all just year old emos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they made a video game about staying in a civil war its called this war of mine and it is soul crushing i wish those guys upvoting this shit would at least play it a little it is trully eyeopening
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,next theyre going to ask why dont muslims fight back terrorists and why dont muslims denounce terrorism as if they already dont for both counts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously people complain about young muslim men being refugees and i wonder every time why someone expects these men to stay in a wartorn country to fight and possibly die would they think the same if they were in that position would they stay and fight if a civil war broke out in their country i get the feeling for most of these complainers the answer would be no its always easy to judge if one didnt experience the same shit the refugees went through
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like uvorpaleskimos approach on this empathy cannot be exploited or fucked so whites have no use for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of the first rules of neoliberalism is the exact opposite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one on reddit has a soul
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not necessarily disagreeing but it is technically possible to gild yourself on an alt account
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that may be a great idea for a fundraiser for every shitty gilded post about refugees donate to groups helping them out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao i wish new years would just go was just a prank and revert everything that happened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,syria should be a wake up call of how easily something like that could happen here syria was a developed and civilized country prior to the civil war the refugees are well educated they needed to have good jobs to have the opportunity to get out of syria but brown people are scary and reddits white male dae stems will surely be accepted with parades as refuges when trump starts bombing cities that dont vote for him in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,would they think the same if they were in that position would they stay and fight if a civil war broke out in their country sorry for the late reply but yes they think they would apparently americans think they can use their guns and shoot out anybody that tries to take over america despite the fact that most of them lack actual military training and are more likely to shoot friendly fire on their own teammates before they can even pose a threat to the enemy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its only funny to people who never were affected by rape or war and have no empathy whatsoever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fucks sake rape is something you never make fun of things like this are what accentuate rape culture and cause men to constantly rape women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god damn it reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no it really isnt at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know people who have had their childhoods ruined by sick fucks i dont think joking about pedophilia is very sensible people die from war its still funny to joke about it though people get raped its still funny to joke about it though in reply to captainrtard on this isnt your first post in this sub about pedophiles i think there is a recurring theme with you at utc wrote i know people who have had their childhoods ruined by sick fucks i dont think joking about pedophilia is very sensible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel like this is some kind of fallacy anyone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what do you mean
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rape is funny shitheads why isnt taking anyone taking it seriously when men get raped also shitheads
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a popular sub people here dont just browse this sub and this sub only lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just came across it its not that low karma the minimum required is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,daddy whys reddit so liberal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quality insight from gastherefugees there comparing the negative gypsy stereotype with blm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jesus christ i cant imagine what they stole but theres no way it warrants being stripped half naked and beaten by that many people fuckin barbaric
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont mess with working class these are much more likely petite bourgeois
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now for a word from their sidebar comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders bans racism sexism homophobia transphobia harassment race baiting etc abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban yep i totally believe they enforce these rules
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this pillocks comment sucks and they should seek help for all those hateful thoughts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this made me legitimately sick to read
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rpublicfreakout sucks fuck you rpublicfreakout fuck you reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good gypsies suck at utc avuncularpederast replied to good gypsies suck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,valuable conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it reminded me of that horrifying picture from wwii of a jewish woman running for her life while her clothes are being ripped off and ukrainian children try to beat her to death its sad that the world hasnt changed at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats because property is irreplaceable and priceless but human life and dignity are replaceable s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more likely title is literally shop owners lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but by all means whittle away what precious little karma i have you redditors and your melodrama lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,romani people literally are an ethnicity and saying all romani people are criminals is like saying all white people are school shooters and run down protestors with their cars
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well then i stand by this pupbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,precious little karma
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree with the other reply its not a stereotype when its true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no its not because all white people do in fact do that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant tell the difference between having lots of karma and having none its almost as if karmas practical effect is nearly nonexistant is this the kind of culture that makes people think gamergate is important
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh the old you cant complain unless youre the literal most unfortunate person ever arguement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but take away your vidya and its nazi germany all over again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre right hence white privilege is a real thing its never a white persons fault
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this sounds a lot like white men complaining about affrimative action false rape accusations and pc culture banning their favorite fatpeoplehate and coontown just try so desperately to appear as victims so they have some validations for their failures in life remember how black people where slaves for years well last weekend some white dude was stuck in traffic due to blm i guess both are equally victims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you talking about white people because im pretty sure youre talking about white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and stinkyrefugee talking about themselves again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its sad theyre so desperate to be oppressed but they were born in to super comfortable lives where they never actually face any hardship you dont know the suffering the lack of suffering causes these people in reply to freudjesusgod on i wonder how empty your life has to be to care about someones bobblehead at utc wrote its sad theyre so desperate to be oppressed but they were born in to super comfortable lives where they never actually face any hardship you dont know the suffering the lack of suffering causes these people httpiimgurcomggzygeupng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you arent oppressed cried the person almost literally the least oppressed demographic on the planet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,projection
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like reddit to me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more like the you cant complain unless i the arbiter of truetm oppression say you have the right and then only if its not a criticism of any group i belong to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black people where slaves for years some white dude was stuck in traffic due to blm youre right its crazy to think they are both equally victims it sounds like the white dude was the one inconvenienced not his long dead ancestors tell that to all the black people who lived through redlining being systemically denied quality employment housing and educational opportunities due to their race this shit wasnt centuries ago in progressive seattle these policies were in place through the midseventies elsewhere was worse if you really think the current generation hasnt felt the impact of being put in ghettos and all attendant racism youre deluded or racist yourself some light reading if the former a hearty fuck you if the latter

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this guy is using rsrs as his own personal army because he needs to hide behind his supposed disability because he gets called out on stalking women op seriously this sub is used to highlight the sexist racist even ableist and other hateful ideals that are popular on reddit there were several people in that thread who are on the spectrum and they are telling you that harassment isnt part of your disorder therefore you calling out autistic people for calling you creepy is both ironic and makes you look bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol just realized op is the guy who harassed the woman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what he was harassing the porn star on her instagramwe shouldnt be harassing women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah and what
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no people on the spectrum not having compassion for each other is sad and why we will never succeed as a community
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hes the op
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its their fault gilded
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly this is reason enough to deport all illegal residents of australia you know the whites
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of comments are some variation of ha ha lube dispenser what kind of club is this and its almost like they want people doin it in the bathroom if you read the article it makes it clear and also everybody before you who made the exact same useless comment had it explained to them too security staff at the club detained the man before police arrived i want to believe that it was with fuzzy punk handcuffs yep thats gay people for you everything they do is just another day of mardi gras dude it seems like gay dudes get a lot of action if the got lube dispensers in their club i think thats why people hate on them they get more ass than a toilet seat im sure thats why gay men are still men they know that sex is the goal and dont have to try and decipher a womans subtle hints ha ha yeah women suck even in a conversation about a gay sex club we have to remind everyone how women are all manipulative monsters the amount of people thinking this was just a regular gay nightclub with lube dispensers is unreal well how the fuck would a straight person know what a typical gay club looks like i mean gay people are basically a totally different species we dont know what levels of depravity those freaks sink to fs this planet is going to complete shit people been abusing gays since forever this is nothing nothing to do with abusing gays as you put it its how some twisted fucker thinks that its acceptable to put acid into a gel dispenser knowing full well that it will be used i dont care about people targeting those gays im just outraged that somebody would do it so creatively also knowing full well that it will be used dude he did it because it would be used not regardless of that knowledge that was literally the intent of the crime you cannot be that type of minority without being somewhat prepared for attempts at violence and murder via lube dispenser at least this was at this is why i dont go to defaults any more
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on the motive for a lube dispenser being filled with acid at a gay sex club fashion envy no doubt in reply to antiproton on the motive for the attack is unclear is it though at utc caspissinclair wrote fashion envy no doubt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not even saying that explicitly its just like this total from oh this is bad who would do this to omg gays are like so stereotypical and not individuals lets make light of disgusting illegal hateful behaviour towards them because so gay lulzzzz
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its widely been reported in the media that this was at a gay and bisexual sex club like literally a place you go for sex why wouldnt there be lube also bringing up women out of nowhere like dude this is literally the least relevant thing rn

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this from a bunch of clueless white people who didnt know a nursery rhyme was racist next up huh what do you have against aunt jemima pancakes and uncle ben rice minstrel theater well i didnt know that therefore its not racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but how dare those fake nerd girlstm steal our culture amirite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah how dare those cucks treat brown people like human beings
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like true but this completely ignores power cultural appropriation involves marginalizing and denigrating the people who originated the thing youre appropriating ops basically saying everything evens out over time so why give a shit but the current context matters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bunch of hypocrites first of all that is missing the point of cultural appropriation second these people who say cultures come and go are also the ones complaining about white genocide or preserving white culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cultural appropriation is a nonissue cultures come and go they always have and always will they are not monolithic untouchable holythings with no interplay white socalled allies love sucking up to minorities to the point of fetishizing and creating delusions about how we think in reply to poochyenarulez on at utc cablecar wrote heavy handed but very accurate image i was banned from a cultural appropriation watchdog type subreddit because i commented that hey maybe that white dude with a tattoo design from india half my family is in fucking india might not be a racistbigothitlerignorant fuck i get so heated when people complain about henna and bindis for example they sell that shit to tourists over there cultural appropriation is a nonissue cultures come and go they always have and always will they are not monolithic untouchable holythings with no interplay white socalled allies love sucking up to minorities to the point of fetishizing and creating delusions about how we think were normal people but those types of whites are wackos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt the op also one of those people who get pissy when others say white people dont have culture and as a mixed person who was raised white i must askwhat culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i honestly dont get their response to it either like i didnt know about the origin of that nursery rhyme but when i was informed i was like oh jesus christ what have i been doing and stopped whereas their reaction is to double down is it that hard to admit youve done something shitty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel like its a strong self esteem preservation instinct if youre told youre wrong about too many things at once and you dont have a healthy attitude to being wrong right in the first place as if somehow being right all along was more valuable than simply being right no matter how much it took you to get there then eventually youll reject those voices go into shutdown mode and just deny any wrongdoing on your part and the next step of course is to find likeminded people to give you a sense of being right and belonging

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a theory that a lot of reddit nonsense is teens and twentysomes quickly losing grip on the current state of affairs trying to convince themselves that theyre smarter than everyone else
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a theory that people who have never questioned the power structure of society are intellectually incurious and possibly terrified of losing their privilege
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my degree is super stem and im a sjw fite me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if we make universities tuitionfree then people will finally stop making these tired jokes about the tuition money spent on nonstem majors for me thats reason enough to support tuitionfree university policies if we support universal basic income they wont be able to make jokes about the work ethic or intelligence of people struggling in jobs that pay below the living wage if we support a four day weekend we wont hear any more jokes about how much mondays suck i support progressive policies because i want to end hack comedy pls sign my petition
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pushes her cs degree back behind the couch oh absolutely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in the last minutes ive read a post where people are jerking about crossfit being dumb and a jerk about pictures of food for instagram being dumb so i guess with this sjwgender studies post here i have completed reddit for the day not yet you have to find an ironic post about reddit being dumb before youre finished wow u shur told em those other closeminded circlejerks r definitely tolerable now bc u noticed there r people who actually take a stance against em that definitely makes em good again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,philosophy is dumb math is true and science is a way of knowing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know where they get this idea that there are a lot of people with gender studies degrees
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a theory that redditors are afraid of confronting their own mediocrity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sjws are pure scum nonstem degrees are just expensive toilet paper in one comment damn son this kids hopping on the karma train
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,huh a bunch of stemlords who dont know what the word theory means
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jokes on you i have a philosophy degree and a doctor of jurisprudence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you have to bring up your stem degree in an argument to convince the other side that youre intelligent the argument is probably not going well for you reminds me of all the dumbasses who have to quote some random bullshit about their iq because all their points have been refuted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its because they all got their stem degrees and are stuck in their shitty jobs that are boring as fuck and have no hope of ever advancing upward because they are intellectually average as hell unless they get an mba which is not stem and conceptually impossible for them to grasp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but hey thats just a theory a shit theory and cut
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its all the people who studied this in college who are wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my cousin who doesnt have a degree and was kicked out of colleges makes fun of people who get art and gender study degrees all the time his lack of self awareness is outstanding
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a theory that a lot of sjw nonsense is due to people with gender studies degrees trying to convince themselves that was money well spent in reply to ihatehambeasts on maybe you shouldnt have taken on in student loans to get a degree in renaissance basket history at utc howsurcsgurl wrote i have a theory that a lot of sjw nonsense is due to people with gender studies degrees trying to convince themselves that was money well spent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dear redditbourgeoisie swine the income potential of a degree only determines the value of the degree if you got the degree to make money my sociology degree is of great value so is my cs degree for different reasons eat it ya pukes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a le stem degree but worship brd le checkmate redditeurs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a theory that a lot of physics nonsense is due to people with philosophy and art degrees trying to convince themselves that was money well spent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people who havent bothered to read actual challenging books trying to convince themselves that that wasnt the missed opportunity it obviously is one that leads to lazy gut reactions crystallized into dumb stances
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youd think stemlords would know the difference but ah well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what stem degree id be willing to bet very few of the people who jerk over them actually have one in fact id bet there are more here than there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i did a course not a degree mind in software dev and there was no kind of functional organization and even if it wasnt for that id still have fucking hated it the classmate i communicated most with was some year old who did nothing but spout memes at me all day nonstop watched montage parodies and added me as coowner of his shitty meme page on facebook
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how original
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol fifth sweeps in to shit up the thread a little more his obsession is sad and hilarious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this comment is spot on well said
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im literally ap rofessional scientist and a sjw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mine is math i am mega sjew ill join ur ranks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if we support communism we can just round up all the white men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if we make universities tuitionfree the federal govt will be paying the tuition so the tired jokes will continue just with more of an antigovt flavor if we enact a ubi theyll just make jokes about the work ethic and intelligence of people who choose to only live on that much money i stand in solidarity with you against tired shit jokes comrade but we must continue the struggle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if we ban commercial flight we can put an end to jokes about airline food once and for all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cs what does that stand for complete sjw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh dear brd how could i miss the parent comment to ops linked one maybe you shouldnt have taken on in student loans to get a degree in renaissance basket history considering thats in response to the the utter lack of selfawareness is hilarious only better because its from such a brilliant username as are you ready for this ihatehambeasts also where the frick did howsurcsgurl get sjws from talking about student debt are economics and personal finance evil sjw subjects now or is it just because a girl drew the comic so she must be a shevil harpy feminazi or is it bc only sjws are openminded enough to go into nonstem majors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,philosophy is dumb logic is a field in philosophy ∴ logic is dumb checkmate stembros im so rational
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean science is the one and only way to know things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its why im in huge favor of reverting science back its original name natural philosophy its more fitting anyways
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no youre supposed to spend years miserable and almost failing classes so that you can graduate with a marketable degree so that you can get a job in a field you dont like and work years to pay off the debt while living frugally so then you can finally start living life for real after years of being unhappy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha learning for its own sake what are you some kind of intellectual cuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only thing they want to look at critically is anything that questions their superiority complex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heh stupid sjew cucks gravity is just a theory its not even real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre a dj
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and i bring up that carol vorderman believes in detox diets which are garbage how high youre iq is knowing what youre talking about

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,beep boop emotions are for weaklings rational mens do not consider emotions when making decisions every aspect of the human experience should be quantified and calculated coldly and without compassion beep boop oh my god the feminazis spermjacked the ghostbusters my feeeeeelllssss
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me too thanks except for the paying off the debt part
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,either that or you get into an entrylevel position work your ass off and become the secretarys secretary she never went to college though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its funny because the degree is called a doctor of jurisprudence but a degree holder is a juris doctor

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lets not make gulag jokes please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ahem you can just say art
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everybody keeps letting their emotions cloud the conclusion that i am one of the elect few that only lets logic influence their decisions and am thusly deserved of a position of power without responsibility
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive explained to shitheads before that like no not everyone can successfully get an engineering or medical degree because not everyone is good at that kind of stuff or not everyone even likes tha tkind of stuff i was told that you shouldnt be going to college then which like right im sure you dont want your therapists or social workers or accountants or managers to have degrees
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes i do understand youre a law graduate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but a degree holder is a juris doctor so does that mean you listen to dido and get verbally abused by dr cox
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jayz more like jd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well no doy in order to to be successful in any environment be it professional academic athletic or even just in a club or a family gathering you have to be able to socialize without pushing people away from you you arent going to succeed professionally if everybody hates working with you you arent going to succeed academically of all of your professors and fellow students think youre an asshole and people wont be lining up around the block to be your friend or romantic partner of you cant open your mouth without saying something horribly bigoted or insanely ignorant when you have nobody left nowhere else to turn to and absolutely no desire to change your behavior to be less repulsive you turn to places which cant turn you away namely websites like reddit and the anonymity of free for all internet forums doesnt breed the horribleness the horribleness makes turning to free for all internet forums the only option available for people who either cant or refuse to express themselves in any other way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats just because thats a soft science so you have nothing to be proud of an engineer could easily learn all that stuff in mere days s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you gulag jokes are a mark of shame on the left
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you so much christ almighty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,studying the arts is worthless being an artist is stupid oh my god how dare you criticize my terabyte collection of child pornography tasteful anime girls it is clearly art and therefore beyond criticism because i dont understand anything about art or criticism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no youre thinking of a teevee doctor its a common mistake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a great explanation for why so many people on the internet are so shitty when most of the people i know in real life are quite reasonable and pleasant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yup my dad is an electrical engineer who could never hold a job for very long because he hates everybody and everybody hates him so he loves to rip on nonstem people just to make himself feel better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously its disgusting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it really isnt about being smart tbh go into rmath for example there will occasionally be threads in there where the op asks if someone who isnt as intelligent as rmath can get a math degree the nearunanimous response is that rmath worked their asses off to get where they are they werent supergeniuses or anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my dad kept trying to convince me to study business jesus fucking christ ive cheated for business grads in the past took a few courses of theirs business is the worst fucking degree program ive ever had the misfortune of working in its legit disgusting they essentially idealize fucking people over as hard as possible and the students tend to weirdly communicate in stupid business jargon i literally saw one of them say something about shifting paradigms you dodged a bullet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a good rule of thumb that anyone who is a supremacist is that way because theyve accomplished so little that membership in is all they have to be proud of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not all good mathematicians have iqs becoming educated is mostly about work if you work hard you will learn a lot and become very good in the subject
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,business jargon is the weirdest fucking thing cloud synergy dynamic paradigm shift revolutionary disruptive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its seriously ridiculous when i read neonazis on reddit constantly saying white people invented everything and im just wondering what have you invented
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they want to say they have invented everything but they dont want to own up to slavery
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hmmhmm true that what the hell do they even do other than write racist bullshit on reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know black people fought on both sides in the civil war right and that slaves led rebellions to free themselves do you know the history of slavery get that white savior mess out of here and go pick up a history book
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dinobenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how can these people read about groups of all men signing bills that legislate womens bodies and still think that patriarchy isnt real just how
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how to tell someone doesnt know what patriarchy is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it feels almost systematic at this point the way discussion of social issues reddit dislikes goes i only gave the thread a brief overview but it always boils down to three point misrepresentation of the issue either through humour or taken to the extreme and arguingdismissing it in that manner misunderstanding of the term either the term is not aptly named to reflect the issue if only it had a nicer name it would be much better received or there is no ready information regarding it there are always claims but no representation of the issue or what it means normalization of the issue it is either a normal human trait or women also have done it do it it is an appropriate reply and so on any time a sensitive issue that requires a bit of thought a bit of consideration a bit of reflection and just a teeeny tiny amount of empathy are required to get into it is always met with this hostility
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lolll masculinity so fragile hes proud of doing the work of a stool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same redditors that posted how they dont take their girlfriends words seriously because theyre short or how they relish putting things out of reach of them but yeah theyre nice guys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i helped a woman get a thing take that feminism oh boy you sure showed us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont feel too bad raustralia is mostly a support group for the extremely unemployable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im guilty of putting cookies and candies out of my sobs reach only to learn my wife cant reach them either im not proud of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think its the shelves that are the tool here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my short girlfriend couldnt reach the tea on the top shelf so i manfetched it down because shelves are a tool of the patriarchy in reply to scrapjunkie on i worked very late one night last week the train home was almost empty so i manspread even wider than usual hows that for toxic masculinity at utc mathuselahh wrote my short girlfriend couldnt reach the tea on the top shelf so i manfetched it down because shelves are a tool of the patriarchy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,by putting their fingers in their ears and going lalalalalala i cant hear you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i directly benefit from this arrangement so im going to keep pretending it doesnt exist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is le merit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because women dont have personal anatomy silly thats why we give them less control over their own bodies than we do the deceased
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder how many just dont care until financial abortion is a thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when somebody says that the concept of toxic masculinity exists so that feminists think men are evil it shows that they have no clue what theyre talking about unfortunately a lot of people keep spreading this shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well he seems like a real stool sample
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this coupled with the recent links to persecuted short men jokes on here gives great irony on tumblr short girls highly enjoy selfdeprecating jokes short girl problems on reddit guys love complaining about how oppressed they are and being malicious about short girls heights yet sexism dont real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a tall guy what the fuck dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wish it were that benign can someone help me find a better word than benign i think they are completely unaware which is far more dangerous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,learning what toxic masculinity is was the turning point for me i used to be a mra sympathizer but i read about what toxic masculinity is toxic masculinity is when someone is deemed less of a man because they like something that isnt in the list of things that are acceptable for a man to like say think wear or do often sexist insults are used such as you throw like a girl in elementary school and others i dont think srs would really appreciate me bringing up for good reason it applies to an effeminate male or a domineering female really a double standard im rambling so ill shut up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe a need to assert their masculinity i dont know if its at all comparable but i remember before my im a woman realization i would think to myself about advantages of being a man as a coping mechanism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the first part refers to a meme post with tree beard about a taller guy not taking his girlfriend seriously due to her height it was a joke but it was quitely fucked up as a lot of commenters more or less bragged about how they treated their smaller significant other like a juvenile and in a dismissive manner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no keep talking its clear these idiots need everything explained to them preferably in one and two syllable words and the more they hear it the more likely it is to sink in ah who am i kidding theyre never going to listen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought toxic masculinity is the one thing mras care about thats alright i also used to sympathize with them till i realized its less about mens rights and more about shooting down feminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when people call out governor lepage for being kkk grand wizard levels of racist theyre not letting him clarify what he meant see when he said that black people and hispanic people named dmoney smoothie and shifty come from new york and connecticut to sell heroin and impregnate white women he didnt mean that as an jim crow lawmaker level of idiotic paranoid racism he meant that literally three men named dmoney smoothie and shifty come up and supply all of the heroin in maine then impregnate as many white women as possible before going back to nyc and connecticut to resupply all lepage is saying is that dmoney and shifty happen to be black and smoothie happens to be hispanic brave law enforcement agents in maine may have successfully identified the three men responsible for all of maines heroin and interracial children but theyre still no closer to stopping them but lepage will never stop hunting them because hes motivated by more than just a sense of justice you see his allies wear blue and enemies wear red we need to shoot the people in red comment wasnt him inciting race violence on criminal levels thing is hes a crypt and dmoney shifty and smoothie are bloods lepage and the crypts infiltrated the highest government office in maine just to stop the bloods expansion into maine all of this is truths

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are they wisdom teeth extractions thats like a rite of passage i recently had mine taken out because they were impacted its usually a problem for teenagers to mid age groups
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i second this also if anyone knows if they even sell legal copieskeys of win yet could you let me know where and for how much no gray markets please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont really have any medicine for it though i might be able to pick up melatonin or something after work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my teams are largely aesthetic too like im never going to use those cloud genies from unova because they are ugly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ivs dont bother i never have if you really must then wait until sun and moon roll around for hyper training ev training thats pretty simple super training is ridiculously slow what you do is get the right items and fight horde battles that give the right ev its pretty easy and can max out that particular ev stat in battles personally i only have one pokèmon that i use for battling that isnt part of a previous team ive used in a play through haxorus
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like commie shit to me dental pain is just your bodys way of communicating love for the free market
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they arent actually thats the worrying thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,personally i just chug nyquil seems to work lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you cant find something that helps ive heard kava tea helping quite a few people that have stressrelated sleep issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im in the process of quitting lexapro which you shouldnt take nyquil with so im a little iffy on doing that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah nyquil can increase the possibility of serotonin syndrome in people who are taking antidepressant medications not worth the risk benadryl is a possible alternative but it will increase the effects of the lexapro namely drowsiness so it is best to run it by a doctor first your doctor might be willing to prescribe a lowdose benzodiazepine for you to take as needed temporarily maybe halcion i wouldnt take them for more than temporary situations though they are addictive and personally speaking my memory takes a temporary hit as for sleep aids like ambien i prefer to stay away from them but thats only because they made my ex hallucinate his ass off quite scary but it doesnt happen to everyone from one insomniac to another i hope you sleep better soon sorry that youre having nightmares i hate that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the dextromethorphan that is the problem in nyquil benadryl is diphenhydramine nyquil is dextromethorphan acetaminophen and doxylamine tylenol pm has diphenhydramine but it also has acetaminophen so maybe thats what you were thinking of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is this as chemistry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeppers it is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hahaha sorry i live in the south during these hot summers theres not much else to do except study otc medicine i kid i kid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no need to apologise i was just making a dum joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my life became infinitely better when i ditched bro friends and made friends that actually cared about anyone but themselves its not hard to have a good time without being shitty to someone im all for jokingly giving someone a hard time or kidding around but a lot of guys forgo that for just straight cruelty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not surprising at all that these are the same people who view rape by taking advantage of a drunk woman as false rape charges its just a prank chill the fuck out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tfw your brain has been so corrupted by shitty bro culture that you cant see that your friends are assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why would you do something like this to someone you enjoy and care about do redditurds even have friends do they know what a friend is because its not this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people expressing concern about a video of people doing things to a friend who has obviously consumed too much alcohol chill the fuck out you prudes its harmless at utc theangrybrian replied to in typical reddit fashion people have to whine about how this is assault the kid is dying etc lets all just assume the worst no fun allowed here not like he just passed out drunk and theyre all friends having a laugh and fuck they wrote on his foot other people write on peoples faces chill the fuck out you prudes its harmless
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,right in the comments they laugh about him apparently muttering please stop meaning he was barely conscious and probably feeling sick you dont turn that person into a puppet you get them in bed and drinking water and hopefully at least a piece of bread in them so they wont feel as shitty in the morning its fucking rude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,antifeminist logic in afghanistan young boys also known bacha bazi or boy play are sexually abused by older men so because boys have it worse in afghanistan this means that young males in the west cannot talk about issues they have to deal with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the entire thread is an mra shitshow with a title like that who wouldve thought
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are you people so obsessed with hitting in the first place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny how there are male double standards in the entire thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i liked how every time that a women answered they got mansplained on why their double standard was logical and good for society
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actuallylately ive seen others justify men hitting or threatening to hit others just because they were angry and i havent seen people use womens anger as an excuse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,half the stories on that thread are pure rthathappened material
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as overthetop triumphalist liberal as the west wing was i always think of this line whenever i hear about these issues mras bring up there is a population of this country that seems to focus a great deal of time and energy on this conversation so much so that i am moved to ask this question is there an epidemic of flagburning going on that im not aware of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all of the worst reddit threads that arent in hate based subs are almost always on askreddit its always some pointed ass question and the op always gets the biased answers they were looking for my favorite from this week was how are voter id laws bad actually come to think of it i think that was which has the same problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny how they linked a poll from the when women could not get help things change
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,b
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,askreddit what malefemale double standard do you dislike the most that a girl thinks she can hit a guy with no consequences the entire thread is an mra shitshow at utc wickeddealer replied to that a girl thinks she can hit a guy with no consequences
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i watched a documentary about them called the dancing boys of afghanistan very sad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had to reread to make sure it was twox
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yet when you hit a nazi thats where you crossed the line
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol i was thinking that the whole time i kept scrolling to see a double standard that women face but nope and if someone did say something i can guarantee it was hit with well actually
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is logical turning into a dog whistle or something because i seem to see it a lot coming from anti feminists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but i thought institutionalized sexism was a lie propagated by evil faminazis i cant even keep up the joke ew mras trigger my gag reflex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean half the stories on that sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,right at least on the hate subs they usually are upfront about being hateful assholes on places like askreddit they always try to hide behind jokes or im just being logical
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,doesnt even explain in simple terms like the name would suggest the users interpret it more like eli have a degree in stem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah who gives a fuck what reddit thinks i dont ask high school kids about my
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course it is its just an extension of mensrights at this point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but see heres the thing the nazi didnt attack you first he was just peacefully advocating for ethnic cleansing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont agree with everything nazis say but ill defend to the death your right to say it everyone deserves free speech but sjw courses should be removed from all universities and feminists are poisoning the minds of the youth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well it is when you have internalized biases against other groups of people so yeah pretty much a dog whistle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my favorite one has got to be how many genders are there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all hail stem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill defend to the death your right to publicly and with a huge platform say black genocide would be a good thing for the world reddit not even including the i disagree with what youre saying because lets be real reddit wont even pretend it doesnt agree with nazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he just thinks that people should be racially pure america is a white country made by god for whites and no one else is totally a philosophy that a person with a good moral compass would advocate for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly logical is the new im not a racist but because just calling yourself logical is proof enough its unfortunate that many of these people dont even realize they are sexist and racist they just know that seeing hillary or obama in power made their tummies feel funny so instead of admitting theyre prejudiced like we all had to do at one point they logic it away with heartless justifications and defense mechanisms no one is born perfect we all have to admit our faults to become wiser source im super duper logical s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and when they act like nonbinary gender is a new thing so many cultures have more then two genders and have had them since time immemorial even in european cultures there are plenty of cases of people living as another gender there just wasnt a word or concept attached to it iirc there is even an ethnic group in the balkans that had a third gender which i think translated to something like lady husbands
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,declaring your intent to kill one person is worthy of a punch declaring your intent to kill thousands is not worthy of a punch only stem kids get it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow i wish i could be logical but my brain runs on electrochemical impulses and is susceptible to issues of framing sexuality hunger emotions and all that human stuff i wish i were a computer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and some men like to be kicked in the balls but you dont do that to a fucking stranger in the middle of a conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reverse the genders
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the next time rodditors throw a tantrum over srsters being allowed to breathe some redditors like being eightyearold girls have cooties boys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rthathappened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant read anything from the redpill perspective without my brain exploding
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some redditors like being written off and condescended to like all the poor little redpillers in that comment chain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fucking gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these guys really need to make up their minds on whether or not the is something worth referencing didnt that used to be their go to meme whenever someone suggested that perhaps we should me more progressive with our values since we arent living in the goddamn middle ages anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please excuse me while i throw up forever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,was mid conversation with me and our other friend and a girl he just met kept trying to join the conversation he literally put his hand over her mouth and said shhh the grown ups are talking now some women like to be treated like little girls in reply to nocontroll on my friend did that at a bar once and i cant believed it worked he was mid conversation with me and our other friend and a girl he just met kept trying to join the conversation he literally put his hand over her mouth and said shhh the grown ups are talking now she just stopped talking and was all over him the rest of the night i couldnt fucking believe how egotistical and rude it was for him to do but god damn it it worked at utc littlenative wrote some women like to be treated like little girls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unless you know that stranger is a redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it does make for an interesting conversation though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when you feel like you own women of course thats what you think your job is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well duh were just too stupid to do that ourselves s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no thats some crazy feminazi bullshit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love the ridiculousness of the red pill stories that entire subreddit is a bunch of basement dwellers lying to each other the most pathetic place on reddit by a country mile
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or its really helpful for abruptly ending one side of the conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh i see you havent seen rincels its even more gross if thats possible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,absolutely bunch of people relaying stories of what they would like to do or say in specific situations to women to teach them a lesson i think for being a woman and stuff everyone just plays along
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i dont know if red pill ever sanctified a mass murdering pathetic scumbag
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,far smaller and less active though i mean i suppose theres rtruecells and all the nazi subreddits but whatever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they banned me for preaching the truth many of the guys in there only want virgins who are hot and skinny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of the most active shitposters on rtruecels before it got quarantined turned out to be a father of a little girl who wanted to find her in time for her birthday and have sex with her
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,from what i saw didnt seem to be the case seemed to be quite a bit past their preferred age
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait but i thought the indians were supposed to be the super bootstrapping model minorities
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,still better than having white folks in the area
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,south asian families have a tendancy to pack as many people as possible into houses when they run out of room they take over other areas and they treat everything like shit literally they shit everywhere in reply to biffmcgee on i bought a house from some dude he had previous tenants the house had a basement apartment but no one was living in it the previous tenants had keys they gave the keys to their brother from india i go into my house and i smell curry im like wtf is happening i go into the basement and a family of adults kids were in the basement sleeping on single beds with a propane cooker on the floor the brand new laundry machines were completely soiled the bathroom was a disaster i had plans of building a home theatre in the basement but we had to renovate it now because everything was soiled i called the cops my lawyer and house insurance the family was trying to squat because the previous owner said we were moving into the house in days they tried striking a deal with me but i had to get the cops to kick them out and a lot of lawyer work it was a major fucking problem at utc sendintheclownz wrote stuff like this is becoming a serious problem in brampton ontario south asian families have a tendancy to pack as many people as possible into houses when they run out of room they take over other areas and they treat everything like shit literally they shit everywhere my sister works in the brampton courts stuff like this comes through pretty frequently the worst i heard was an indian family that took over the entire attic space of four attached houses there was about of them living up there and in the one house they owned there was a corner of the attic that was so saturated in urine had to be replaced
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,butbut hes white that makes things ok s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like he made that up too i swear i saw the same thing on a confessions site once
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when has an influx of whites ever improved a continent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when has an influx of nonwhites ever improved an area you sure sound like a piece of shit whats that you have some thoughts on the canadian indian residential school system native americans didnt many would say still dont take care of their kids properly so this happened these kids got a chance at a better life boofuckinghoo ah you are a piece of shit my pappy and grandpappy were both law enforcement officers they used to tell me of the good old days when they would crack some heads coloreds mostly got me so jealous now it my turn white supremacists are scum im a police officer in greenville north carolina and i guarantee that i will use necessary force if i catch one of these freaks hows using the wrong bathroom thats a promise doubt you are but assuming youre not a massive liar in addition to a bigot man are you ever living breathing reason for blm to exist thank you for your service shitlord httpswwwredditcomuserilearneditfromyoudad for all your racisttrash tagging needs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course the big news is that people like that can read
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aaand he scrubbed his entire comment history a bigot and a coward im shocked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,damn socialist public schools
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its so cute how you think youre people dont you have a sister to woo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a small comfort to imagine the day when he is long dead and his country is no longer majority white and everything he hates has come to pass
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,eh i worry the fuckers will manage to kill us indigenous folks off first theyre all thinking it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dude i got called racist a couple of times before its not a big deal if you get called racist a lot maybe its you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so basicallytheir feelings got hurt and they decided to throw a massive temper tantraum to get attention sounds about right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or perhaps if their response to being told some of their views were abhorrent was to go full fascist they were never really moderate to begin with im sure plenty of the people who ended up on the side of the francoists in spain fancied themselves moderate heroes just trying to stop le ebil bolshevik commie boogeyman but when the chips were down they were all in on the side of fascism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the altright is the result of spoiled middleclass white boys who spent their entire life being coddled being told they could do no wrong finally being told to shut the fuck up for once their poor little egos couldnt stand it so they decided to latch onto white supremacist misogynistic doctrines like every other generation of entitled shitbird before them to try to squeeze some tiny drop of selfesteem out of lacking melanin having a penis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a dumb ass way to avoid criticism we only exist because we disresgard everything you do so everything is actually youre fault
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just struck me how much the altright is like a cult
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its your fault were racist why are you making us do this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sympathize with the klan while spewing antisemitic memes and youre just trying to be heard but if you so much as show a hint of understanding for why blm protestors might be taking actions that result in slowed traffic youre a fascist lol feminazi cuck sjw whos trying to destroy ❄️🍑 and the fabric of society as we know it 🍳 this is your brain on white supremacy any questions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its so cute how he thinks hes a grownup
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,scratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly the same lines are used by abusers to excuse the abusive relationship its always the victim that has made them commit the abuse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the alt right is rising and it is making you squirm yay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the altright is a direct result of them being outcast and ridiculed when they were more moderate causing them to radicalise in order to be heard in reply to gnodez on k at utc pmmeurdoggos wrote as i said elsewhere in this thread the caustic nature of td and the altright is a direct result of them being outcast and ridiculed when they were more moderate causing them to radicalise in order to be heard without the narrative pushing and speechsquashing nature of the left the right would not be as radical as it is today the right is the lefts fault
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they elected this shitbag because they need a whole country to be their safe space
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre just as immune to facts thats for sure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every day that passes it sounds like a better idea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people turn to terrorism be it isis or the kkk when they already have a base level of bigotry and the material conditions they live in crumble so much that they become desperate and angry enough to listen to the false answers right wing demagogues give them weve seen it happen time and time again there is a way out of that though either not having that base line of bigotry or showing people who their real enemy is in both cases that enemy is capitalismimperialist capitalism spesifically for iraq and the solution is democratic ownership and management of the means of production
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey this comment has been removed by our automod for ableism your crossed out word please edit and it will be reapproved
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what was revolutionary catalonia not marxistleninistsstalinists for one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this isnt whut
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre right it isnt which is why this is happening batben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is sparta
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what part of you is neon exactly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my leg hairs serious answer my flair neon legbeard for future reference because i change it all the damn time is a reference to a rant about sjws or something that was posted here a while ago accusing us of being neon legbeards or something like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does the carpet match the uuh foundation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can memorize minutiae of hundreds of video games movies etc cant learn basic sociology redditjpg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive stopped growing as a human being since grade school
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats not understandable is identifying as an otherkin transneptunian potato waffle ok but hiding your transphobia under a pile of hyperbole doesnt mean its not blatantly obviously transphobia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are they so fucking obsessed with it literally when talking about any subject not even related to gender in the slightest theyll still bring it up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is reddit collectively the least funny site
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im picturing them reading about gender slamming their laptop closed and in a world weary voice saying im too old for this shit then they reopen their laptop and type angry rants about video game journalism for three hours because you know priorities if it effects them specifically its important if not its shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what shit are you too old for dealing with straights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more than genders has officially supplanted attack helicopter as the warmedover meme of choice for douchey teenaged edgelords of all ages
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,say hello to law everyone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what are you too young to realize the adult world will expect of you basic courtesies extended to people different from me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,our boys girls and other humans down in the slightest theyll still bring it up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah hes just dumb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for as big of a person like that and im still not that hard to not consciously misgender people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are people far younger than i am who are far less tolerant forgive the humblebrag theres a very large difference between maturing and sticking to what you know which essentially translates to having a stagnant belief system
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a quick check of your post history youre willing to learn minutae about freeagents in sports movies and celebrity gossip job prospects for machinists basic coding and enough about current politics to have an opinion but apparently respecting peoples gender is just too much for you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont someone think of the war of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if neil degrasse tyson explained how gender is a social construct would the fuckfaces be less dense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every goddamned time askreddit every goddamned question is eventually answered there are only genders even if the question was what kind of soup do you like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does it make me inexcusably proeugenics if i admit that i cant wait for people who are too old for basic empathy and human decency to leave the planet to those who arent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on raskreddit what shit are you too old for learning more than genders at utc replied to learning more than genders httpiimgurcomzltgbtipng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shitlord grew to level shitlord wants to learn empathy but shitlord already knows moves should a move be forgotten to make space for empathy bad pun drop mental gymnastics deflect facts nice guy whinge yesno shitlord did not learn empathy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maturation and learning are apparently sjw conspiracies designed to turn all of humanity into a race of cucks or as nonshitheads call them well adjusted human beings
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,from their comment history i was amazed when i learned the real history of the war of class sold it like we were all innocent trying to build roads and industry when britain just attacked out of nowhere i suspect that you may be a little more on the nose than you expect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,related
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hiding theyve been blatantly using trans in their jokes now so their transphobia is out in the open
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for as much as they love namedropping logical fallacies as zero effort argument enders redditors sure do love a good slippery slope and argumentum ad absurdum
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how many people here have ever met or spoke to someone that legitimately identified as otherkin or as a star or whatever the fuck redditors think they identify as i have only ever seen one tumblr page of a person like that and im still not sure if it was just some tia troll for as big of a stink they make about otherkin youd think there would be more of them me thinks they just use that to cover up and make their real feelings of dislike toward trans especially nb trans people more palatable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,really that just translates as im too lazy to go through the minor effort it takes to use the correct language for talking about trans people because people are learning new language all the time quite often if you study science or math you know those stem fields that redditeurs love at a professional level you have to learn new specific meanings for words that mean something else in a casual context theres no reason it should be considered an excessive burden some of the classes i took in high school even required learning a more complex vocabulary
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what are fundamental language impulses yes i was actually born with a working knowledge of strictly heteronormative english
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just not that fucking hard to learn someones pronouns if you care about them and its still not that hard to not consciously misgender people like i might be tempted to buy it if these fuckers didnt deliberately use the wrong pronouns when presented with the knowledge that someone may be transnb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but my name is stephen nah you look more like an adam to me and its going to be a lot of mental effort for me to rewire my fundamental language impulses
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rbadlinguistics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sjws make everything about gender
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it isnt the funniest but it is the least funniest
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dealing with straights eww do i have to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least theyre being upfront about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck this guy forever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but then its a social construct not real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only chicken noodle and minestrone exist im tired of these liberals making up new soups like broccoli cheddar or baked potato go back to your safe dining place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean i would rather try to change their beliefs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a funny joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,keep telling yourself that kiddo they aaaaaarent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that makes no sense two nickels do not magically turn into a dime
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oregonbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is this oc luv it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive never met one but i think they are out there theyre mostly kids like year olds trying to figure out their sense of self in the world theyre not really hurting anyone reddit and frankly a lot of western culture has this bizarre hatred of people doing anything that makes them unique
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know a decent handful and am acquainted with more than i can count ive also been involved in tumblr roleplay communities for a few years theres definitely a lot of overlap there mostly fictionkin there though which redditors bizarrely seem to be unaware is a thing which is good because jesus fuck the wank would never end if le reddit army became generally aware of the existence of fictionkin most of them are young early teens to early twenties some are trans some arent theres no real correlation aside from both fitting in the greater category of ways people identify and define themselves its their own thing no inherent harm to it just a little quirky occasionally you get some sketchy fuckers who try to use it as a free pass for doing gross unpleasant shit like roleplaying smut with minors but theres sketchy fuckers in every community they dont define it n all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey asshole nobody asked you boardbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mmmmokay we do have a dont interrupt the circlequeef rule if you have questions like this its better to post it to a place like or srsd one of our other sister subs ill just throw up some links to good articles about this because im not super verbose and am kinda tired they discuss nonbinary gender genderqueer and trans gender identity pretty well hope they help httpgenderqueeridcomgqfaq httpswwwredditcomrsrsdiscussionwikitrans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its no more problematic to use peoples preferred genders than it is to remember whether that person over there prefers to be called joe over joseph susan instead of sue or bobby in place of bob or robert i mean wheres the problem remembering these things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pronouns come from god biotroofs apparently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man thinking is hard for bigots its almost like theyre a bunch of dumbshits or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre the one who brought up gender yeah because i was quoting you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only until we develop a cure for it our boys girls and other humans down in the lab are working on it as we speak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unfortunately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,get out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,original and edgy but not too edgy congrats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean me too its an ongoing thing they seek to find great relief in clustering together and sharing their backwardsass views because that makes it more okay because someone accepts them and allows them to flee criticism ya still gotta try
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously that guy couldnt even execute his bad joke properly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,truly if youre different in any way people will seek an opportunity to call you out for it even if youre not harming anyone i dont get why people cant just be allowed to do their own thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for sharing genuinely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,censoring opinions cool what a great sub we have here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pretty sure they just arent a big fan of trans people the idea of being trans and are pretending to be lazy because it looks a little less bad than just directly choosing to be a wanker
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey i prefer to be called dave than david wtf you special snowflake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a really hard time remembering names tho im actually way better at pronouns
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its your words not mine i used your words
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they need to work faster im scared bites nails
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yo just saying if youre gonna get mad then report the comment so we can be more likely to see it not to single you out but im making this a thing i do now reminding people when they comment on shit like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its weird and honestly even weirder is the anti special snowflake crowd sees themselves as a sort of counterculture a bizarre notion when theyre so dedicated to protecting their idea of normalcy i think what must be happening is they think people who are different are generally fine but if people are different in a certain way or of the people being different are of a marginalized group the difference is seen as performative and artificial take for instance girls who like video games whether their interest is fake or genuine the fact that it makes them different as a woman immediately throws a red flag to a certain subset of people and they assume it must be a fake interest for the sake of some ulterior motive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure honestly tumblr is its own bag of worms with plenty of drama and unpleasant shit that goes on there is a lot of identity policing that goes on there and its certainly not great but shitheads on reddit are completely clueless default gross transphobia aside they have no idea what theyre actually attempting to criticize and cant be bothered to learn about any kind of context that would give them any amount of legitimacy with said criticisms well i suppose its their business if they want to loudly advertise how much of a dipshit they are with their troglodytic lol attack helicopter lololol jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you are not entitled to wander into any community you wish and start spouting your shitty opinions without consequence this is our space go away boardbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rule x motherfucker
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bingo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,knock knock hello citizen how familiar are you with the falgsc party
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a joke about lesbians having short nails in there somewhere
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how shit always gets deleted in like seconds flat here i honestly report more things in srs than the rest of reddit combined and im not sure if its just because there are more shitposting trolls trying to trigger le sjw cucks here or if its because i know the mods actually care or a mixture of both
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah reddit really goes after tumblr with no self awareness especially considering how much of tumblr is porn typically centreing cis white men altright sock puppets
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,falgsc fully automated luxury gay space communism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah and jesus fuck is there a ton of it that said people on tumblr dont seem to realize that that element exists on tumblr and throw all of reddit under the bus for itlike yes reddit objectively has a larger population of that particular brand of shithead but theyre on your website too yknow its not as though the problem will just magically go away if all of reddit got up and deleted one day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,automated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like star trek if star trek had ever had more than gay characters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not as though the problem will just magically go away if all of reddit got up and deleted one day friendo you are on the wrong sub to be making this argument
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,luxury
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought that one of the recent movies had a gay character in it a main one even
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,true well it certainly wouldnt hurt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,star trek beyond did but it shouldnt have taken years and hours of showsmovies to have any kind of queer representation star treks total omission of gay people is disgusting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,delete reddit and then delete the whole world just to make sure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,space
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,communism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,communism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we did it srs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in a thread about meghan trainor fat cunt is the only way to accurately describe her in reply to ilikehockeyandguitar on meghan trainor at utc coldmtndew wrote fat cunt is the only way to accurately describe her
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jee fanboying much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,somehow blames liberals for trump at utc asthmaticmechanic replied to i remember seeing these back when bush took office maybe dont cry hitler every time someone you dont like gets into office you might be taken more seriously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt having a household of two more costeffective
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is there a way to award this user with a star of david i dont know why i didnt expect reddit talking about being cheap to be an excuse to parade their antisemitism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wimin r for sex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is the most extremely frugal thing that you have done got a dildo instead of a boyfriend watch reddit explode brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my so has a fleshlight and a girlfriend hes just throwing money out the window at this point s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know whats more sad that they think that theyre denying women their precious manspunk or that theyve turned their existential loneliness into something to be proud of then again i hear you can convert happiness and selfrespect into lentils and maximize your frugality so maybe theyre onto something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh come one guise that was funny right guys hello crickets
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not frugal thats simply lack of any other option
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,srs actually xposted this comment and started shaming me for being lonely and misogynistic these people really believe spreading hate and harassing men is the correct path to improve the way women are treated theyre only going to make things worse would love to meet one of these people in real life baby these tears are so refreshing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is the most extremely frugal thing that you have done got a fleshlight instead of a girlfriend at utc replied to got a fleshlight instead of a girlfriend
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae wimminz are parasitic toddlers that are feed on stemdollars and male tears and cant do anything without the help of the mighty peen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not when one of them is a gross mold of a human being
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or watch the three bazillion pms flood in demanding peen satisfaction
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but le womyn dont pay for menz
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey now sometimes somebody buys a fleshlight because they want one not because they are in such a desperate situation for something other than their hand that they need a rubber orifice to feel good when they master again theres precisely nothing wrong with owning a sex toy the crime is believing that the toy itself is a replacement for the whole of a partner reducing that value down to sex alone as our linked friend does
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe this sounds naive but why is loneliness something to be ashamed of this is a genuine question
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you think thats funny wait until you meet my wife laughtrack
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i looked through their history and of course they work in tech and are a gamer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men are pretty gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my cispeen is now offended that it will never be able to do sex to you even though there was chance of that before anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not all meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the person youre replying to said nothing critical of sextoy ownership per se
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if thats your choice sure theres nothing wrong with it for guys like this not only do they not want loneliness but they dont see it as a choice theyre allowed to make thats where their bitterness anger passiveaggression and regular aggression comes from ex you cant reject me i reject you in this case rather than a desire to make constructive improvements to their lives to be able to enter meaningful relationships since relationships are a twoway street noones entitled to them they engage in gallows humour because its easier gives the same feeling of having power over their lives andor because they dont see their own faults and would rather blame the feminist boogeyman for their problems
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they targeted gamers gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh maybe theyll die out once were done with burning down the internet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we get a government subsidy scaled to the filthiness of our living space its how were able to afford all our spermjacked babies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,implying that owning a sex toy means you are lonely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats the instead of a girlfriend part not the owningasextoy part fetishizing objects at the expense of real human relationships does imply existential loneliness madronaarbutus confirms as much in their second paragraph
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think i replied to the wrong comment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on a police officer that was told that she should have planned better and had to take unpaid leave after getting pregnant this is the definition of entitlement at utc rattrayc replied to this is the definition of entitlement please pay me my full salary because i havent planned properly and am unable to do the job i was hired to do httpiimgurcomqmuzqrbpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,removed the submission is fine but this is the second comment from the same thread you can post this quote in a comment response to your other submission or you can delete the other one too and submit both plus others in an effort post
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay sorry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no worries brdie pleased
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill take the rampant sexism that sounds good in reply to fourwordreplies on its a restaurant menu at utc highside wrote ill take the rampant sexism that sounds good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit rich people always tryna screw over poor people news rich people screw over poor people reddit thats awful news poor refugees reddit woof woof we got em boys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you reddit for the daily reminder that i am subhuman vermin i hope that one day one of them will need safe shelter and is turned away so that they could learn what real injustice feels like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh god i really thought this would be such a cutanddry case where even reddit wouldnt stoop that low also because rich people that arent trump dont tend to fare so well here but then i saw this comment is way cheaper than providing state benefits for life smart choice economically what the fuck brd soon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nothing new rworldnews has been a rightwing circle jerk and cesspool of racists bigots misogynists and so on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that thread proper shows how mc brocialist reddit is like there is a thread complaining about having neighbourhoods ruined by poor people basically generally complaining about section social housing etc got to protect precious white suburbia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats funny is that most of those people probably unironically joke around about moving to canada if trump wins the election
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is that kind of liberal where they bring up corruption as some vague concept they wont elaborate on as a way of driving the conversation away from race
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sad thought when things inevitably go to hell in this dysfunctional system based on greed privileged people like them are the least likely to pay the price for it though noone is really sitting safe in this society i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyll gain empathy someday or so i hope
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,idk if this is the right place to discuss but i believe that i should share my view a view of a person that mostly agrees with the shitpost im from central europe btw the problem about this whole migration crisis is that we feel like were already getting screwed over the economy of our country is already weakish and theres never enough money for retired people some are close to not being able to afford basic living necessities or some ill with a serious disease and disabled people what i often see not irl all of my info comes from the media is the immigrants not even appreciating the housing safety and food that we provide them with they want something theyre in need its our gesture of kindness and humanity to help them directly or indirectly and they complain about living in repainted cowsheds there are photos of refugees with iphones there have been the new years eve assaults in germany and much more is said to be swept under the carpet its hard to act altruistically when all you see is negative and it is easy to make a statement about a side without thoroughly thinking how the others feel
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im surprised none of those comments started with im gonna get downvoted by the liberal brigade for this but
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was the first subreddit to turn i think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,got to protect precious white suburbia god only knows why most dull boring place on earth living in the burbs is like watching white lead paint dry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that thread proper shows how mc brocialist reddit is like there is a thread complaining about having neighbourhoods ruined by poor people basically how is complaining about poor people brocialist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im actually pretty sure that most of them support trump hillary on the other hand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is a difference between adaptation and assimilation racists like those on rworldnews want complete assimilation no selfrespecting person would ever completely give up their own heritage and culture and asking them to do it in return for aid is wholly unethical and frankly inhumane
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is also a difference in people immigrating by choice and people being forced to relocate because of the danger of their homeland
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you got us lad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,triggered wow congratulations on behalf of brd i would like to present you with an award for the most original joak ever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah probably not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sorry that you feel that way but how much of these fears are grounded in concrete fact of course you have a right to self determination and to ensuring a good future for your children but i am not convinced that migrants are doing that much harm economically speaking the main reason your welfare system is under strain is not because of immigration but because of an aging populace due to low fertility rates among natives there are two ways to get around this either through raising the fertility rates of the native population no one really knows how or through immigration i am not advocating for open borders but immigrants are not the problem in this instance what i often see not irl all of my info comes from the media is the immigrants not even appreciating the housing safety and food that we provide them with they want something theyre in need its our gesture of kindness and humanity to help them directly or indirectly and they complain about living in repainted cowsheds there are photos of refugees with iphones there have been the new years eve assaults in germany and much more is said to be swept under the carpet you said that you are relying on media reports are these people a representative of a significant portion of the refugee population perhaps the housing they are complaining about is truly very deplorable i think you and i can agree that being a refugee does not mean its ok to be to treated like cattle you bring up iphones you can get an iphone for which is what would cost to feed a family for no more than three days in central europe these phones might be the only way these people can communicate with their relatives back home iphones are not a symbol of opulence this argument is very similar to claiming poor people are ok because they have refrigerators regarding the cologne attacks while they were undoubtedly horrific only this means that at most two syrian men were among the criminals two out of millions of syrians is this really enough justification to condemn hundreds of thousands of people to denial of a safe haven from a brutal war what about stories like look i do not believe refugees are perfect angles incapable of wrongdoing after all these people are coming from regions of extreme poverty and instability both of which breed a great deal of ugliness however i think there is a humanitarian medium between keep all the filthy refugees out and let them all in my hope is that his crisis might encourage the west to take a serious stance towards ending the war in syria and other places including the exercise of pressure over countries that do nothing but fuel it after all the real solution is for these people to have a peaceful home again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would say any decent person is better than all of reddit any day of the week
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was speaking comparatively to reddits usual free college for me but not for you pls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most redditors seem to support either trump or bernie and theres a large number who call themselves bernie supporters but say theyll switch to trump if bernie doesnt get the nomination
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i sub to srs for the entertainment of reactionaries coming to cry about being linked in srs before they get banned for all the lame triggering jokes nothing is more fun to see people like you getting triggered simply by a thread being linked on a small subreddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a man can dream leo a man can dream
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok thank you for the answer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes but in default subs ive seen huge trends towards trump sympathizing with trump or even spouting trumps ideas or ideas that his supporters have while supposedly espousing bernie i just assume that people spouting such ridiculous islamophobic nationalism are probably trump supporters since bernie doesnt appeal as much to nationalists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think its really fair to expect or demand refugees to change their views on lgbt and women considering how many people there are who lived their whole lives in the west and still have regressive attitudes in those areas i dont see how we can expect refugees to conform to our cultural values to a greater extent than we ourselves can id say its really more about actions rather than behavior as it is right now thinking gays shouldnt be allowed to get married or that women arent deserving of equal rights isnt illegal but rape and gay bashing most certainly are the same standard should be applied to immigrants if were going to turn immigrants away for their views rather than their behavior we should also punish native citizens for having similar views otherwise it would seem were unfairly privileging those who were born in our country
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rwhataboutsrs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,k
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course it is fair just like it is fair to expect other inhabitants of western countries to change their views moreover if you come from a culture where gay people are seen as we see pedophiles gay bashing is a much larger probability the last point is that if you provide a forum where it is okay to be a gaybasher or where women are seen as lesser than men then it will be harder to break the echo chamber thus if you let in large swaths of people without integrating them properly you make the whole progress that much harder and just for the record i am talking about integration not assimilation if you are unable to accept other human beings as having equal rights then you are not fit to live in a western country unfortunately we cant throw out the western people who hold these views already and as such we are forced to change their views
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,let me take your complaints up to the i dont give a shit department
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,k lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can i get banned from this shithole of a subreddit if you ask the mods nicely maybe they will i hate trump ill vote for him that means you dont hate trump ya fuckstick if it means putting an end to this social justice shit lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women do not receive more hate than men which specific women are you referring to um ok
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,both men and women receive equal amounts of death threats men receive far more physical threats of violence while women receive far more sexual threats why not let nobody receive threats oh right kia exists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every time i think ive finally seen the worst possible commentinternet points combo possible out of twox i find out theres no bottom to this endless abyss of disappointment in humanity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes i am referring to the women you hate in question right now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women do not recieve hate proceeds to hate on women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wtf as a gamer like its some kind of marginalized group or something oh wait these people think gamer is a marginalized group
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did this asshole really just shit on women while attempting to downplay how much hate women in the video game industry receive they really just cant help themselves they have to insult zq and as even when doing so undermines the very point theyre trying to make
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a subreddit for women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a lifelong gamer youre wrong ive been stalked doxxed harassed had my life threatened been sent messages saying not even a rapist would touch me unless someone came all over my face had pictures of me when from when i was posted on facebook pages i was not aware of and captioned with vile remarks and been told i should kill myself whenever i asked a question about a game to name just a few things none of these things mentioned are oneoffs either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because as we all know anita gimme your money sarkeesian is literally the only person ever to use kickstarter and she forced people to sign up for her ks at knifepoint too obviously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,years later this continues wonderful i cant wait to roll in my grave hearing this shit still repeated and the constant buzz of srs updates our work is unending
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol absolutely zero self awareness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anita gimme your money saarkesian zoe sleeping for good reviews quinn that one lady whoinsulted gamergate and shoved skeleton content down the players throats g o o d f a i t h o o d f a i t h
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think someone needs to do a survey of rtwoxchromosomes and find out how many women actually browse that subreddit anymore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so its ok to hate women as long as you can justify it with things like setting up a kickstarter getting reviews or basically existing or doing everything that men in the community do on a daily basis got it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that guy that built a better mouse trap needs to build a better irony meter we are way over budget here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women do not receive more hate than men the question is who is more likely to receive the more damaging kind of harassment the kind that uses gendered insults and the threat of violence andor sexual assault i could link you with data that says its women but i think you the op know how to use google anita gimme your money saarkesian asked for got how terrible id be more concerned about the guys who took money to make the sarkeesian effect or whatever the fuck it was and squandered it all zoe sleeping for good reviews quinn you mean zoe falsely accused of sleeping for good reviews by a worthless degenerate who should be flayed quinn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,normal interaction person a theres this problem person b okay how do we fix it reddit interaction person a theres this problem redditors nuhuh ive never witnessed it prove it prove it to me using ungodly amounts of evidence i dont believe you youre lying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women do not receive more hate than men proceeds to write comment hateful of women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,notice they immediately mention some high profile cases as if this shit doesnt happen constantly in the gaming communityindustry to just regular women no ones heard about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh my gosh i was expecting kia i did not know that had sunk this low
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it continues to boggle my mind that folks like this think nuh uh is a reasonable rebuttal to an assertion whose evidence is before ones eyes women just get shit on and they get shit on more than men like you can say otherwise all you want but anyone with an internet connection can see it its almost like they act like feels reals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the thing is theres a difference between just standard threats insults and insults directed at you because of your race gender sexuality the same way its worse to call a gay person the f word than it is to call them an asshole general threats violence are really impersonal but when it becomes about that persons gender sexuality race its no longer just standard internet dickishness its discriminatory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont hate women except these ones and all the other ones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same request i had for gaters in show me the reviews
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how dare she insult gamergate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a gamer and game developerthis didnt even need to be said we get that he hates women with authenticity saying hes a gamer adds nothing to this for effect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a gamer and game developer youre wrong women do not receive more hate than men which specific women are you referring to anita gimme your money saarkesian zoe sleeping for good reviews quinn that one lady whoinsulted gamergate and shoved sjw content down the players throats in reply to marklebombarkle on problem is on twitter is lots of men create female accounts example being the womenagainstfeminism hashtag so many of those accounts are men pretending to be women secondly the important thing here is who is receiving the abuse which is by and large women as a gamer the abuse ive seen directed at female gamers or women who work in the gaming industry is horrific and needs to stop whether the perpetrators are male or female at utc wrote as a gamer and game developer who has worked in the industry for several years youre wrong women do not receive more hate than men men receive far more hate the type of hate is what is different both men and women receive equal amounts of death threats men receive far more physical threats of violence while women receive far more sexual threats now which specific women are you referring to that receive that abuse anita gimme your money saarkesian zoe sleeping for good reviews quinn that one lady who was in charge of that balders gate expansion where she insulted gamergate people and shoved sjw content down the players throats all of those people have received far more criticism that is valid but instead dig through tweets to find the death threat instead of the tweets about how they dont actually play games have ruined characters and steal money from people without delivering their promised content
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well if hes measuring sexist hatred against our hatred of his idiocy id say its a close race
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know because there have never been any corrupt male games journalists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wanna dox this guy so bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think redditors understand the concept of more
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes but dont you understand they deserve it therefor we cant blame this poor man for hating them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the fuck why why i swear to god i will never buy a single product advertised on reddit this guy is so upvoted and hes arguing that women arent harassed as much as men in a sub supposedly dedicated to winners perspectives what a fucking embarrassment how reddit will ever attract women is beyond me when behavior like this occurs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,before i clicked my guess was it was going to almost certainly be on kia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fake gamer bois make ashamed to play vidya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gamers they targeted gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive been playing video games since they were monochromatic and on floppy and people like this are why i never in a million years will call myself a gamer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the irony being that anyone not a straight white guy is extremely marginalized in gaming culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also he seems to think that playing or making video games somehow gives him insight into the differing amounts of hatred men and women receive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its really annoying honestly it gives people like me who love video games a good reason not to mention that shit to others because i dont want to be associated with these types of fuckery
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you sure youre a real gamer whats marios inseam what does link dream about what are kirbys aunts names yeah thats what i thought s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,intended for womens perspectives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mam youve gone through more bullshit from a hobby of mine than ive endured in my entire life thats pretty fucked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,damn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit i think im starting to become a selfhating man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate being a male im sorry to hear about that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im very sorry to hear about all that shit fuck none of that has happened to me personally at least not because of gaming but ive seen it happen to some acquaintances online in the past and its pretty brutal its scared me out of participating in the major gaming communities
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id be more concerned about the guys who took money to make the sarkeesian effect or whatever the fuck it was and squandered it all fifteen thousand dollarsa month but hey davis aurini got a new car out of it which was totally a justified use of the patreon money
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually its more like person a theres this problem redditors fuck you sjw cuckjob ill fucking murder you for spreading msm propaganda lies freeze peach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,none of those criticisms are valid they all play games but even if they didnt theyd be capable of criticising the content of games perhaps the appallingly juvenile misogyny that is only just starting to shift those characters werent ruined because its an optional expansion made decades later by a different team it was never gonna be that great and additionally the criticism that she forced sjw shit in there is so overblown by out of voices that you might question the quality of criticism headed her way en masse almost as if there were some other problem guiding the outrage nobody has stolen money either none of these people what they have done is be prominent women in video games witness the results of that and despair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that would accomplish literally nothing good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would much rather get a physical threat than a sexual threat thebfsct that he see no difference between the two is interesting considering that sexual threat imply a physical threat as well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddits idea of attracting women is attracting men pretending to be women online
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of the ads i see are for reddit spinoffs and hiredcom so that makes it easier for me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres not much difference tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ban boys from da vidya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill never tire of this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously like you i have been playing games since atari and i never call myself a gamer or a redditor like im big into cycling and i like the reddit kit but i would never buy that shit because i wont no outside association with the culture of this site its the same with gaming so many of the self proclaimed gamers are these massive self inflated ego maniacs im a person who happens to enjoy games
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i called myself gamer until about a year after gg i intentionally ignored the fuck out of it because i hate both sides at the time now im just someone whos primary form of nonwork socialization takes place on steam and the majority of their free time is spent on euiv
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black and white or black and green
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would love if they changed the sidebar to reflect reality a subreddit about women intended for mens perspectives and removed the insulting pretense that male opinions represent women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think much of the internet needs to be reminded that online is still real life and they are picking on someone over the pettiest most insignificant bullshit and their behaviour has consequences
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive met a lot of other women whove had similar experiences as well sure my male friends get online harassment but they never get an inbox full of vile comments about rape or how exactly someone would prefer to fuck them barely a peep when they say anything online i make a joke about a game or ask questions and people make multiple accounts to harass me and my friends
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think you should hate being male just hate that many societies pretty much turn a blind eye to men harassing and threatening women as they have done since forever and swear up and down that men are the real victims when some meanypants woman posts a screenshot of some poorlyspelled screed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a man you may have more influence over other men i feel like maybe this is womansplaininglol how i think being a man would be but itd be nice to call out misogyny without being seen as a self serving harpy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not going to let it keep me offline i like the internet and i like gaming i use pseudonyms for everything now let people believe im a dude etc so i can just play in peace if someones been friendly i correct them on matters of gender and ask them not to mention it to others who are not so friendly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cuckjob is such a funny word its probably all the k sounds for reals though thats a pretty accurate characterization
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really want to try imzy where did you get your invite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,excuse me but misandry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i had any sense of design id totally throw together an srs kit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,paradox games consumed my soul or wait yuri did that or something else whatever euiv is the reason i have no friends
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black and green all the way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its actually amusing how many in the games are art crowd actively avoid and ridicule games that can actually be considered art
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get stuff along these lines just playing a female character in an mmo all the girls i play with take steps to make sure its never apparent theyre a female player to attempt to curtail shit like this guys who deny this happens constantly are deluding themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you first
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dunno having to share the same sex as some of these people makes me sad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,womansplaining misandry jokes aside the people willing to dismiss misogyny are mostly also the people who would believe in those toxic gender roles and so wont listen ive been called a white knight before for calling out misogyny wew but hey someones gotta say something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can call it out but most guys dont care or will say she deserves it or some other way to brush it off then come after you for even questioning their shitty opinion in the first place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me too lets be euiv friends pm your steam
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont really play mmos since the games dont normally interest me but i play other styles of games and get abuse from the communities for voicing my opinion or joking around or even asking for help ive received ingame abuse before when playing social games some people see you doing alright at it and realize youre not a dude so they go off at you ive even been called a stupid fucking whore over a bloody mobile karaoke game for crying out loud
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get the same feeling sometimes when i read some of the filth other women leave on my instagram page when i post about feminism or fatphobia but i tell myself im not responsible for their bullshit so i have nothing to be ashamed of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of the few perks of being a trans woman no longer having to do that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thx i sent an application via menslib on imzy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your existence is empty enough to hate other people this much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah well for me its a lot more personal but i guess youre right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you first
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we dont allow violent rhetoric here sorry youll need to use a different username if you want to participate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for a boatload of genius men there sure are is a lot of poorly researched armchair genetics in that thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exclude women from education and careers for centuries if women were so smart why did men get all the best degrees and jobs huh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,say it with me now twox is a sub for womens perspectives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this might sound very sexist but fuck it i dont believe virtually all great scientists having been male is if you look at this graph there were sexist standards then and there are sexist standards now just goes to show humans dont ever learn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i never used the word intelligence i said iq literally said in the end most exceptionally intelligent people will be male a few comments above the same commenter claims that they are simply claiming that men have higher variance instead of calling women dumb i guess you cant expect mra trolls to be consistent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is just patently untrue to say virtually all great scientists have been male like all you have to do is punch women scientists into google and youll get a fuck ton of results ten minutes of cursory scrolling will entirely disprove the notion that women have contributed little to science and men did all the work the irony of these champions of logic and reason deciding to skip basic research and make judgments based on their limited personal experiences is profound the most visible scientists are largely male gee wonder why but it is flat out factually incorrect to assert that virtually all great scientists have been male christ this bothers me a lot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,twoxbabyjpg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does that include the great scientists who took credit for the work of women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for your very clear and objective reasoning gauging by upvotesdownvotes most people clearly agree w you and not the doubter its actually common sense before this era of patriarchy paranoia and excessive equality talk people understood this instinctually the most brilliant people are almost always males in terms of nature and genetics its like nature takes its chances with males males are the competitors and females are the selectors men are more expendable but men also reap the benefits of this greater genetic variability also in terms of producing great scientists men on average have better spatial reasoning skills the cognitive space in females is taken up more by emotional and social processes people may cry sexist but think of it in evolutionary terms men needed to hunt so mental navigation eye hand coordination and understanding how distances and archscurves etc work is selected for in males while females are selected for social adeptness thirdly the male sex drive sharpens and heightens what men will focus themselves to achieve testosterone is proven to enhance cognition but also the concept of competing and making the most of your abilities so you dont go sexless females dont face this burden of performance the way males do the end result of all this is male genius as a female you are genetically safer nature plays it safer with its females although brilliant females do exist but the males are more subject to the rawest of deals but on the other hand look thru history basically all geniuses are men its not the patriarchy lulz the fact that this may even be considered sexist shows how much common sense is lost in our current society this has to be a troll
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id offer him a penny for his thoughts and get a httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsilnivxpins

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the fate of twox is one of the best arguments for safe spaces ive ever seen a space thats supposed to be for womens discussion without proper rules became a place where comments of girls iz dum get voted to the top
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the hell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the smartest boys are more brilliant than any girl across the population this is scientifically true i was about to say this this might sound very sexist but fuck it i dont believe virtually all great scientists having been male is if you look at this graph at utc replied to well scientifically boys comprise both ends of the bell curve of intelligence so the dumbest boys are dumber than any girl but the smartest boys are more brilliant than any girl there may be exceptions within any given classroom but across the population this is scientifically true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsilnivxpins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,b
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,making that sub a default was a mistake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what are you talking about females were never historically discouraged from obtaining education and pursuing scientific inquiry s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think he could have made a more incorrect statement he also left in the wiggle room of saying virtually so if anyone informed him of female scientists he could dismiss them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they wield the word logical like its a billy club harry potter magic wand logosium just because that shit fell from your mouth doesnt mean its automatically logical the most ridiculous shit and they think if they run around shouting logosium no one can legitimately point out its ridiculous because if you use adjectives youre an emotional hysteric its a trap they say something thats easily pointed out as fallacious or wacky and when you do point it out then they claim you wont engage them on the issues and being emotional and say you need to use logick and reason when the most reasonable response was the one you gave — to point out how illogical their claims were not to accept their claim that its reasonable to debate the collective intelligence of arbitrarilydefined groups of people with the intent of designating some groups superior and some groups inferior
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you dont have to be a woman to find that horrible any self decent human being will find that horrible

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how evo psych dummies notice something b hypothesize why that something would have made humanity more evolutionarily fit iii assert most plausible sounding conveniently reaffirming hypothesis as the answer disregard any claims of social involvment there is no nurture anymore criminals have oddly shaped skulls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the same guy just off the top of my head from earlier google search there was another study done in scotland there been a fair amount of data on this and another one of their comments probably every cam girl on the planet has daddy issues i hope youre off that its not healthy for what its worth i think youre a very beautiful middle eastern woman you gotta find the right guy who can be your daddy so yeah not a troll unfortunately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men needed to hunt so mental navigation eye hand coordination and understanding how distances and archscurves etc work is selected for in males while females are selected for social adeptness this is some euphoric archaeology right here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when will all of this evolutionary pseudoscience shit die
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,enormous mistake i used to like it nowadays if i wander in there i have to fight off male opinions with a stick like neo in the matrix reloaded
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit was a mistake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most plausible nah just assert whatever the fuck you want aint nothing on plausibility women are more suited to be hunters because they are more slight and therefore can hide better that is why they have more ability to see colour than men to see things to kill take that quadrouple down ignore all forms of evidence ignore the fact that we just dont know ignore all forms of present societies that function differently and then extrapolate from a hypothesis based on how people were tens of thousands of years ago despite talking about evolution that happened millions of years ago not tens of thousands and therefore explain why women are poop evo psych being used to explain any form of current societal phenomena is beyond stupid if your theory is based on multiple unfounded hypothesis than you are beneath creationists on a level of unscientific bullshit yes i am saying there is more foundation to saying the earth is years old and any evidence to the contrary was placed there by an omnipotent diety than saying because x therefore q because q therefore p because p therefore x because x i am better than women or to put it in ways for a stemlord to more easily understand you cannot claim to love science or to like science or to give a single solitary fuck about logic or science if you go on to argue from an unscientific point of view without any basis in reality one last thing why is it that stemlords seem to think they can talk about pretty much everything i get it science is cool but much like i would go to a dentist to talk about my teeth and not a physicist i would go to a sociologist to talk about society not some random twat doing engineering we get it predditors you like computer games dont like apple think that xkcd is hilarious but wish monroe would stop talking about sjw things and just make jokes about equations and spiders again and that stem is awesome and the root of all knowledge but stop pretending that your first year computer science degree makes you more qualified than those evil sjws who carry out research over in the sociology department to talk about society or gender or videogames or journalism or politics or anything that is not directly related to writing fucking code sorry about the rant its been a long day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who can be your daddy i threw up in my mouth a little
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at some point you just cant get progressive enough for a college feminist to fuck you racism in law enforcement my cispeen feels left out of the conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol dude ok response
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its interesting they cant actually find anything wrong with the image itself so they resort to slightly related insults and vague exclamations of outrage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had a wall deck once it was mildly amusing but not really viable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it scares me that babyhands has a shot at the presidency
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,harridan a strict bossy or belligerent old woman aka an assertive woman with opinions and power but past her prime sex object years making her useless and terrible for roddit i can see this catching on around here where its all day every day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,harridan fempire frozen peach censorship squad revoke this persons thesaurus access
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well this is a new and creative way to ask how can you shit on minorities today
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,skeeving surely that was meant to be the brainless set phrase lying thieving xyz is this like for all intensive purposes but for retrograde politibros like theyve heard it a million times but never seen it written down because a they dont read anything not enclosed in a reddit comment box and b no one with sense actually fucking writes like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for me its hillary for president how can anyone vote for this lying skeeving harridan in reply to dermuenchner on for me it is sanders for president at utc navellinty wrote for me its hillary for president how can anyone vote for this lying skeeving harridan
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this hillary is a liar moreso than other politicians trope is super annoying politifact has bernie saying roughly the same ratio of true things to unbased things and we all know reddit trusts politifact completelybut only if its smearing hillary plus shes been in the spotlight for a lot longer and has a dedicated smear campaign leveled against her
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the fuck is going on with that do they just look up old insults all day trying to figure out the next cuckold
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,indeed its like awwww wookit they learned a new word wait until they find out theres more of those big new words in books that have chapters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do the wimminz have to have opinions and not be all about my peen it shatters my narciworldview where im more important than everythingstream of reddit tears trail to the bedroom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit on trump strong assertive talkative reddit on hillary strict bossy opinionated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,another oldtimey bigoted word for these liberal redditors to pair with cuckold wonderful
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well said she isnt sticking her ass out in a video game so shes useless to reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but then you could just criticise her for being a neoliberal hawk no reason to bring up her gender unless youre one of the berniebros who on top of their sexism dont seem to give a shit about bernards support for imperialism as well as drone murder fwiw tldr ☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or scheming were they trying to say scheming
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i want to bring back rantallion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah they love new pejoratives to use on assertive women bossy is just a way of saying assertiveness in people who i dont want to be assertive women and children i never heard of an adult man being called bossy in my life i dont know my stance on clinton at this time being nontrump is pretty decent but regardless i hate when reddit collectively tries to take women down a peg screw that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone linked you here from tia go back to tia now run along
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,today i arseholed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the gamergate subs abusive daddy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i keep thinking about how neonazis use the term sjw to silence and mock liberal people its hypocritical when you consider the fact when they complain about how the terms racist racist and homophobic are applied to them and to silence hate speech
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hi i am posting this here because i dont know where else to do it weve been suspecting my nephew to have autism for quite some time now but we always brushed it off because though he showed some of what might qualify as autistic behavior he was alright pretty normal in a couple of threads some redditors were cleary stating ther opinion interracting with the community before stating they had autism which brought me to the conclusion that i had a terrible understanding of it thus i asked the question on askreddit it blew up i did not expect it to turn out this way it made it to the front page i got thousands of replies i even got gold for it so many people shared their insirational stories with each other shared advice most of all they shared so much love it was very helpful to many family members friends because it helped them understand their loved ones better share their experience with people in the same situation but most of all by now i can confirm that every redditor with autism knows by now that they are not alone ive been going through reddit for a fairly long time but i only got an account few months ago i dont know what heap is going know i didnt even know some redditors were stupid enough to use autistic as an insult or make fun of someone who had it i forgot to put the serious tag on my thread but i reported as many comments as possible i tried to read the fresh replies as mush as the best ones i tried to read as many stories as possible comment with when i didnt know what else to say to show my support i got a lot of karma and gold on both my thread a reply which both seem pretty useless to me so far except for the fact that they show peoples appreciation for my thread yet i got so much hate in my inbox in some of the replies accusing me of using this thread solely for karma gold which to this very second i dont even know how to use i would like to close this by saying to anyone who took the time to read this you are not alone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,finally stopped stressing out about being back at uni and i got some really nice silver holo nail polish today so everythings good at the moment seriously this stuff is amazing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does anyone else know what this whole donna hylton thing thats going on is ive seen some people saying she did some stuff that if true makes me massively disappointed in the organisers of one of the marches but all of the people saying so are td denizens so i cant work it out for certain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know most of you very well but i just wanted to say that i care about you and i enjoy the community that youve helped build here i admire you for speaking out about things that a lot of people ignore dont let the haters get you down you are needed here and thank you for all you do both in the world around you and online
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,raustralia has gone down the shitter the past months used to be genuinely leftwing help the poor help the minorities even help the women okay sometimes it wasnt but its reddit ill take it today marks two days in a row that theyve spent jizzing over how feminism is bad and the root of all evil and basically doing the whole reddit vs feminism thing weve all seen times before fucking hell guys i used to be proud of the fact that my countrys sub didnt subscribe to the reddit ideology of building a giant strawman out of genuinely good people and spewing hate at them now im just about ready to unsubscribe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does anyone have any insight about how millennials are across maybe just western europe are they generally more leftists like they seems to be in the us more right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its projection pure and simple kind of ironic when you think about it they accuse sjw of being offended by everything yet flip out when a black person is on the cover of a video game or movie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the thing that irks me is how they steal terms and misuse them fake news was never cnn it was weird facebook articles talking about obamas fema camps
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what always gets me is if they describe sjws you realize they are just describing themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a bloody commie and they always accuse me of being a liberal hillary supporting if i dare say i disagree with trump or if i say anything really its what they do their arguments for believing in what they believe are so weak they resort to name calling
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh you posted that small world eh thank you for reaching out to us it means a lot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yet i got so much hate in my inbox in some of the replies accusing me of using this thread solely for karma gold which to this very second i dont even know how to use i would like to close this by saying to anyone who took the time to read this fuck those people i was one of the people you replied to and i got a couple of good replies to my post and even a couple of pms from parents with autistic children asking for advice so its safe to say that you did a good thing fuck all the haters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ayyy i was gonna pm you this afternoon to thank you for being so cool in that thread i didnt really contribute my own take that much cause im not doing too amazingly atm but it was really nice to see a thread that actually treats us as people for once rather than some anonymous bogeymanjoke to point and laugh at i went through and reported a ton of those comments as well they were really irritating you da real mvp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,after jon started frequently making rape jokes as easy comedy i try to avoid his videos like fire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh why do all the internet comedy dudes end up going reactionary this reminds me of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hadnt heard of this can you link the thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,makes me massively disappointed in the organisers of one of the marches thats the actual purpose of highlighting it same went for fox news not shutting up about madonna for three days straight while ignoring that the largest protest in us history occurred the day after trumps inauguration the propaganda machine is still at work still trying to do its best to convince people on the left to not trust each other and to not organize and resist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,she served years for murder the story goes that a friend of hers offered her for aiding in a kidnapping of a con man who had stolen a large sum of money from someone close to the friend hylton was supposed to deliver ransom and act as a driver at the time she had grown up being abused by a pedophile and her mother and at the time she accepted the offer she was living rough the friend who was supposed to pay her then said she had to witness a rape and threatened to kill her family if she did not it escalated to murder after the victims family refused to pay the ransom conservative media are exaggerating and leaving out a lot of context especially the multiple paragraphs about how sentencing at the time incredibly bigoted such as a woman getting years for accessory whilst her boyfriend got for the actual murder
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,check the comment histories so many users are from td its astonishing i have no doubt theyre organising a take over
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hi this is a circlejerk sub please try thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,calling someone a racist is too divisive ten minutes later haha youre a stupid sjw™
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was a beautiful experience
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you guys you rock
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it helps that he hasnt made anything funny in like two years
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a safe way to get clicks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mmhmm diversion and division
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow after reading that article im disgusted they had her as a guest speaker
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im gonna disagree on the melbourne sub like you can be a dumbass and critique feminism for not doing enough for men without creating a giant circlejerk of whataboutme thats how rmelbourne approaches it and at least it doesnt make my brain melt but yeah im pretty sure its just the global surge in reactionary politics causing it theres a lot of angry white men out there who flat out refuse to look below the surface level problems they perceive or even look at problems that dont directly affect them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh wow yeah would you look at that i just looked at the users going down the page on that shitty antifeminism thread and it starts with a guy who posted to tia then youve got a thedickwad user then a frequent kia poster and then a guy who only really posts in australian subs but his name literally refers to the red pill fucking classy people in that thread wow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i tried thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone in that thread said turkey should ban islam
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae we should murder all muslims because islam is a violent ideology but oh lets just ignore all the white men saying we should commit genocide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit hq spez muslims are killing other muslims what can we do to fix it pmmeyourbuttcrack can we blame the feminists spez hmmget a focus group on it and well discuss it at the next meeting but we need ideas for right now what if we say that islam is primitive and incompatible with western ideas someguy guys this is clearly a complex political issue we cant just daekiddieporn shut up sjw cuck can we just kill all the muslims spez thats the best idea so far well come back to this later next order of business child molesters daekiddieporn hashtag not all pedophiles fin
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,strange how your average redditor suddenly cares about feeeemales when the topic of islam comes up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,christianity used to justify slavery theres nothing wrong with it just bad people taking advantage of it and we got better islam used to justify terrorism the entire religion is bad start over and destroy all believers perfect logic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well if islam is a peaceful religion why is it the muslim countries that were always dropping bombs on youd think if they valued peace theyd move somewhere that isnt being bombed all the time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,islam is one of the most successful religions in the world with one point six billion adherents worldwide the vast majority are peacefulbut like any other religion islam has sects and some islamic sects are violent the wahhabi sect of sunni islam for example believes in violent proselytization you dont get to utterly condemn entire faiths because of their worst sects
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,todays world is failed and has no business being the standard for humanity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck these people and the movement of logic conservatism is a failed religion and has no business being in todays world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what constitutes a failed religion islam is kind of a big deal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know what pisses me off rightwingers always talk shit about islam but they have no constructive ideas about what society should do if their viewpoints become widely accepted no deport islam is the opposite of a constructive idea its blatantly obvious that antiislam rhetoric is just a dogwhistle for being antibrown
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck these people and the religion of peace islam is a failed religion and has no business being in todays world in reply to notherlevel on at utc obliviousirrelevance wrote this video brought me to tears think of those lives needlessly lost mothers fathers husbands wives childrentaken away in a blink of an eye for no reason fuck these people and the religion of peace islam is a failed religion and has no business being in todays world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but what about white genocide they put a black person in star wars which is basically the same thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddittxt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its our feeeemales
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feeeemales hisssss
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but of course they cant move to the us or the rest of the western world because they will bring terrorist attacks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,from the dictionary of reddit logic n the reasoning process by which a claim i made is true because it was me who said it illogic n the reasoning process by which a claim is false due to having been said by a woman person of color or trans person when that claim doesnt conform to my own opinion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think they define a religion as failed if mostly brown people believe in it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for how much they use the first amendment to defend hatespeech and fascists theyre really quick to throw it away when it comes to islam
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can you provide a source for this im genuinely curious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what about us drone murders the us is a christian country according to conservatives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,others should have to assimilate to white values this is what cultural integration means we shouldnt have to incorporate other cultures values into our own thats dilution of the race and literally genocide s since this is dangerously teetering on poes law
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it would be nice if redditors could care about somebody that isnt sawcsm apart from shitting on somebody else or claiming ownership of them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,could have easily just said kids with negligent parents dont develop as well as those who have loving parents but whatever floats your narrative
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh here let me spew my reaganera political tripe out without doing a single iota of fact checking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the issue is the lack of a second income source in a single parent household if income is equal i doubt there is any effect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some more gold what a female raising a child on her own how preposterous this is totally relevant in ah yes this is what i come to rtechnology for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,science says children that grow up in a household devoid of peen are more likely to become infected with cooties later in life source scientific journal of peen vol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literally doing some study on this at the moment and the biggest reason father absence is determimental is the quick drop in socioeconomic status nearly all the problems that plague children from single parent households also plague children with two parents that live in poverty basically the solution is for all dads to pay proper child support and not be dead beats single mothers are not to blame
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,apparently theyre still working out the bugs in their empathy emulation module
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so let me get this straight reddit single fathers are great single mothers are terrible yet women are also child bearers who shouldnt be working difficult jobs because their place is in the home
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kids without fathers are at massive disadvantages that can cripple them later in life women are perfectly capable of raising children on their own single mothers are the strongest people in society in reply to on i feel like this is evolution at its finest people choosing traits that will make their offspring more attractive to potential mates further continuing their own genes while further propagating the already attractive genes all without any of the typical social interactions and typical human mating behavior fascinating but kind of icky it also kind of makes men obsolete other than for studding its literally what we do with farm animals i guess we make decent bed warmers at utc higmage wrote kids without fathers are at massive disadvantages that can cripple them later in life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its almost like all those nerds are whiny bros who want to feel important but not have any responsibility
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,expecting basic nuance from rodditcom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a strong factor but id also think time availability would be another big one one parent holding down two full time jobs isnt going to have as many opportunities to spend time with their kids as two parents each with a full time job wouldand even if a single parent was being paid at an equivalent level with one full time job to the hypothetical two basic maintenance duties which typically get split or at least can be split fall on the one parent its not impossible but its very probably harder even with income accounted for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,damn this reminds me of when the world hunger organisation did a bunch of studies and found that world hunger is caused by poverty it seems blindingly obvious now but before those studies people would argue that hunger in the third world was caused by climate and that food scarcity would never end funny how a lot of negative things in this world are due to economic instability its almost like the current economic system we have is harmful to vulnerable groups or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,looks like this guy believes almost no one in the world is circumcised outside of the us in reply to misinformationfixer on most women prefer circumcised penises its just a fact that really hurts a lot of mens feelings as a personal anecdote ive never heard a woman in my life say she would rather have an uncircumcised man at utc captainneemonoy wrote except in you know any country besides the us where circumcision is rarely practiced
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,translation i want to do the racist opinion puffin shuffle on roffmychest like i do on radviceanimals and raskreddit and they wont let me waaaahhh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,subreddits that are proud to be full contrarian edgelords have repeatedly been the source of brigades im ok with that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,context if you post on hate subs such as rkotakuinaction you get automatically banned from roffmychest the fact that they put scare quotes around wrong here is unsettling
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what subreddits are surprisingly hostile roffmychest a sub dedicated to support and inclusion will ban you if you post in the wrong subreddit at utc drvesuvius replied to roffmychest a sub dedicated to support and inclusion will ban you if you post in the wrong subreddit

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do you think this is an act of refugees i didnt say a refugee did it but most car burnings are acts of muslim youths who are migrants or the descendants of migrants hence my comment about importing problems without high levels of migration from muslim countries countries like sweden and france would be seeing a lot less burnt out cars not to mention crime my head hurts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when will european countries stop importing problems at utc ghenghisyeswekhan replied to when will european countries stop importing problems
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but no its europe for europeans america for europeans africa for europeans asia for europeans the whole world for europeans

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it truly is just the worst
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how can these people honestly be this misinformed holy shit how do you not understand basic civil law and even more than that basic human respect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,loony blm supporters make up narratives like these they think cops are racist for shooting criminals if the criminal happens to be black yes every police shooting is justified and there is definitely no racial bias whatsoever in any police force in reply to poopinmybottom on do you have trouble forming cogent arguments well come on down to redditcom all you have to do is make a sarcastic comment deliberately misinterpreting what the other person said voilà now theyre a white supremecist surely it cant be that easy i hear you say well worry not on reddit anything is possible you can slap your head onto a keyboard and call it an argument if you like debating is easy on redditcom at utc felonydumper wrote he never accused anyone of being a white supremacist httpiimgurcomvwmfidzpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was obviously being sarcastic of course there is racial bias and many shootings arent justified why do you think im at
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why is any sense of reason completely buried and ignored on this website ignorance is bliss i suppose
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think op included your comment because it wasnt poop yet it was downvoted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh that makes way more sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and the penalty when you dont listen is to be executed in the street makes sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill take things only white boys say for alex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah they all very similar but only because one is a complete strawman construction and we are ignoring all historical and cultural context
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its amazing how you completely manage to miss the point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you think its amazingly similar then why do you only support white nationalism while you think black nationalism is regressive left™ evil reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its amazing how similar white nationalist and extreme insular black rhetoric is at utc juronell replied to its amazing how similar white nationalist and extreme insular black rhetoric is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its ironic because whenever someone attacks white privilege or male privilege a bunch of antisjws complain about the evils of progressivism and how they are being censored even though they are perfectly free to spout their shit on their own platforms without the government stopping them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly this person isnt native american or a member of any other indigenous group or african or asian or latin american
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can be a white nazi and half the country will spring to your defense mourning your bruised jaw and dignity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt automatically lhf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,triggered by the truth and yetsjws use the term triggered too loosely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think this may be the new actually its about ethics in video games journalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually white dudes are one of the safest groups to attack in reply to pmmeafact on oh but make a joke about white dudes and you cucks kick and scream lmao get back to loser or is past your bedtime and mommy is yelling at you to get off the internet at utc wrote so make a joke actually white dudes are one of the safest groups to attack
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or trans or gay or a woman youre in a domestic partnership with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you could be a window and millions will mourn you if youre broken at a protest when will the violence eeeeend
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well if he gets upvoted ¯ツ¯
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my grade history teacher pointed at me a white student and yelled you should feel bad when we learned about slavery im so oppressed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this entire thread is awful and full of the redditstandard all muslims are violent rapists you cucks comments of course it would progress further to how white americans are oppressed because they have to learn about slavery in reply to a comment about how germans are oppressed because they have to learn about the holocaust
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know where they get the idea that white americans and germans are individually held responsible for the sins of their ancestors when genocideslavery is being discussed who taught their history class for me the message to take away from learning about atrocities was your ancestors did this horrible thing its not your fault but now that you know take care to avoid repeating it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i do believe that american education and culture as a whole focuses too heavily on slavery but not in the way this doofus is thinking all too often we focus so intently on the evils of slavery we often overlook that following emancipation things didnt improve by a great deal for most black americans and that wasnt the fault of said black americans either because after reconstruction the southern white hegemony did everything it possibly could to reassert the old status quo and relegate black people to second class citizenship in the american narrative concerning black civil rights we talk about the civil war but then jump to the civil rights movement of the and completely eschewing over a century of racial discrimination that came after emancipation and this is a problem it gives the impression that the only challenge that black people had to overcome in american history was slavery which is a giant load
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder who else got black slavery shoved down their throats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,awareness is oppression shoved down our throats oppression meanwhile the same people every good thing was done by whites and i am white therefore i get credit also lol to the black history month beatings guy who mysteriously capitalizes white dude that didnt happen but i wish it did every month
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,modern day america is an example of white slavery
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these poor white boys are always having something shoved down their throat minorities or women talking about social issues that affect them the nerve of those pc sjws lgbtq people celebrating their culture and identity only nooormal people are allowed to do that bringing up the legacy of slavery why arent there white pride parades
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,umwhats wrong with pointing out that you are seeing benefit from the socioeconomic ripples of past slavery and bigotry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think this thread is being brigaded hard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,til being reminded of the history of your country periodically is shoving something down your throat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,try being white in the us and having black slavery shoved down your throat like you owned a fucking slave in reply to uddermudder on they cant let go of their past that is fucking funny we have as many holocaust reminders as we do refugees we are forced to remember what we had nothing to do with the holocaust years ago at utc cleancutmover wrote ha try being white in the us and having black slavery shoved down your throat like you owned a fucking slave httpiimgurcomeqzggkupng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,try being muslim in the us and having terrorism showed down your throat like you killed people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this thing happened in the past therefore it doesnt affect me and yet i feel the need to express how much this thing doesnt impact me but it doesnt affect me in any way guys no no its the liberals fault for shoving it down my throat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,salty white tears
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those sjws are so blind they cant see that whites are the only true victims of racism in this day and age whitegenocide tt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a way to redeem themselves bring in thousands upon thousands of people that hate jews thats funny i dont remember them taking in whitesupremacists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i personally think they hate it because it damages their worldview ie that whitewestern civilization could do no wrong the types of people who complain about learning the unsavory aspects of our history tend to be the patriotism no matter what types who see their country as the best and most progressive country in the world and themselves as representatives of their countries ideals and cultures these are the people who feel attacked because theres no white history month or socially acceptable white pride movement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,german schools actually teach about wwii very thoroughly and nobody is held responsible individually because were not responsible for our ancestors deeds its already done and theres nothing we can do about it however when i went to school i got the feeling that we were held to the standard of dont let history repeat itself cant say much about todays school kids though also i personally heard of people travelling to the us and uk and they were asked if hitler is still in power over here and it was not in a joking way the person who asked was serious and a school friend of mine got punched in the face with the words fuck germans on a school trip to the uk this was or and of course i read youre german so youre a nazi more than once on the internet its still a pet peeve of mine but i learned to shrug it off more or less so yes while most people dont hold people responsible individually there are some special kinds that do and i can understand how it can be infuriating to come across these people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is a good point and probably the reason why ive met bozos who see white people as the saviors of black americans because white people ended slavery and whites did reconstruction and the civil rights movement wouldnt have succeeded without white people etc etc i definitely think focusing more on the failure of reconstruction jim crow violence during the civil rights movement and so on would help more people understand the ways in which black people are still marginalized and underprivileged in american society years after the civil war it would also benefit society to teach people that removing explicit legal barriers to success did not result in the disappearance of de facto obstacles for the african american community
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree with you and this is even worse on my country as we didnt had state sanctioned segregation and every racist shitbag will throw the miscegenation card everytime race comes into play
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white people duh how dare their ancestors enslave people didnt they know it would lead to their future grand children having certain words thrown their way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stop watching meeee
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well you have days to ramp up your white guilt or were coming for you in february for the annual black history month beatings during which well shove it down your throat s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,from a psychological perspective i think people hate hearing about white privilege because they feel like it invalidates the hardships in their individual lives learning more about it would reveal that thats not the case but when people feel like their struggles have been brushed over or that someone is accusing them of racism they tend to have a kneejerk reaction of anger hence people getting upset when slavery or its legacy is connected to them in any way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the moral obligation to do something about it is crippling when you realize how bad it is so most people never do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because they cant acknowledge that they have ingrained privilege without coming to terms with the fact that theyre still such failures even when starting out ahead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no white history month i love how columbus day or st patricks day are never considered here arent those white enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no i know you guys do an excellent job teaching the holocaust by the way only five us states mandate holocaust education ca fl il nj and my home state ny sucks that some people actually believe hitler still runs your country though how could he live years
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my second favorite time of the year first being the breast cancer awareness month beatings of course
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its about a culture that is in need of change not about personal blame for the atrocities of slavery simple 👏 👏
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats my secret my feefees are always hurt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no you beta cuck the blackz shouldnt get to celebrate their racial history when the whites so clearly cannot wake up sheeple doublestandards reverseracism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id say patricks day isnt specifically a holiday for white dudes its for the irish we have st george and st david over here in england and wales they have st andrews day up in scotland too id agree on columbus day though for sure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its more that these people feel oppressed because theres no socially acceptable movement to celebrate their whiteness the irony is that its impossible for africanamericans to celebrate their ethnic heritage in the specific way white people do like the examples you mentioned because slaveowners made every effort to restrict their freedom to practice and pass down their native cultures as well as cutting off their connectionscontact with the homeland and yet some people feel oppressed because they can only celebrate their germanirishenglishetc heritage and not their whiteness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think a lot of people dont actually have a concept of time passed like wwii is fairly recent in our collective memory so people dont actually realize how long its been actually had a weird moment the other day when i realized a vet gathering in a dennys were vietnam vets not wwii they looked about the age i associated with wwii vets because thats how old they were when i was meeting them as a child
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holocaust was the best class i ever took in high school
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not like black americans were deprived of their individual national languages and cultures during slavery and only have their african origin as a common cultural core left thus necessitating black history month instead of ghanaian history month
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and st patricks day was completely stolen and destroyed by white americans like they do to everything they get their hands on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like a very heavy class like when racism is discussed in depth first block and youre just thinking cant we discuss societal ills when half the class isnt asleep also a few people might be hung over in wisconsin a lot of people are hung over
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,another point of irony im not sure people who complain about any celebrations of black identity are even aware that there are diverse african cultures people can be deprived of they tend to view african culture as a monolith which makes their objections to black ethnic pride even more ridiculous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,true america has blown that holiday up to ridiculous levels and as someone with a very strong irish family in dublin it makes us all cringe like fuck when we see americans going crazy over it im not irish myself im welsh but americans just take everything and then blow it up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well im in louisville and it was middle of the day so that helped
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why would black ethnic pride even be bad in that case seriously what is so wrong with taking part in your culture the difference is that any mention of white pride is usually followed by hatred
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh yeah if its past noon id be ready to solve societys ills
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,plus there was food in the middle but sometimes it was hard to eat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,woman does anything redditor what a slur fuck this website and the shitbreathers who use it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah insulting women on the internet is way more interesting s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im glad he got his shit thrown back into his face by the other commenters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,since when is skydiving uninteresting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cause playing video games and complaining about women in video games are great hobbies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where are people finding these profiles ive never heard of before oh right theyre parody ones shared by idiots on rtinder
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well all females clearly have fake personalities and anything a female does is obviously for attention such as skydiving playing video games reading books eating breathing existing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,regarding women posting pictures of themselves skydiving on their tinder profile these bitches dont actually lead interesting lives in reply to grandpathundercleese on nope just the kind of shit i see i also feel lame as fuck sometimes im just sitting at home while all these women are taking pics skydiving in front of the sydney opera house and shit at utc wrote cherrypicking these bitches dont actually lead interesting lives httpiimgurcommzwkifopng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,better to be a normie than a rational freethinker
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also the same day redditor why wont woman have sex with me im a le nice guy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,since the womz started doing it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good joke well probably be hearing it in amy schumers next stand up routine at utc morningsong replied to good joke well probably be hearing it in amy schumers next stand up routine httpiimgurcomcdrhutcpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its weird because i cant stand amy but its definitely for totally different reasons than redditurds
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what did poor amy do to piss these people off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember the time a woman had the audacity to think she was funny and people laughed at her jokes i agree it was appalling thank goodness we put a stop to that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean its not like schumer is a selfadmitted rapist or anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they hate her a lot because she said she was sober and had sex with a drunk guy they perpetuate their hate by saying she steals jokes which all comedians do they also find the thought of a woman focusing their shtick around their vagina too vulgar for their precious little selves i am pretty sure they actually hate her because shes overweight and then found a load of other stuff to legitimise their hatred
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sometimes her comedy is only on par with ok to bad comedians but she is a woman while they are not so its awful its like the ghost busters thing if it was truly about a remake they should have been flipping even more shit about the garbage that was total recall at least ghost busters had some genuinely good scenes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,amys account of the situation brings up a ton of questions and at face value seems gross if nothing else did she rape someone i dont know wed need matts account to determine that and not just amys description years later while giving a speech like she was telling a stand up joke my personal opinion she probably did rape him whats gross is i can admit that but redditors will argue til their blue in the face against drunk being a reason a person cant consent but suddenly turn a and parade around about amy schumer the rapist like its a victory lap theyre just as gross as she might be to be using rape as a weapon against her when they dont actually take the issue seriously in other situations fragile male ego though its about tearing down the person they dont like more than its about standing up for the victim edit post locked youre on some shaky ground here uh oh when someone writes it was a speech at womans gala but thats besides the point that they knew the person was blacked out had sex with them anyway that is a rapist saying i raped a person which is why i said my personal opinion she probably did rape him we do not need the other person to say anything pushing for survivors to have to testify on the public record as to whether or not they feel like their rape was valid is a shitty move no we dont and no one is pressing for him to testify anything but confirmation from matt that what happened was accurate and not embellished something a stand up comedian would never do moves the needle from she probably raped him to she definitely raped him which doesnt take anything away from what most likely happened amy raped matt and just like that redditors will turn around and whine about drunk girls can consent and talk about the similarities in responsibility of killing someone while driving drunk and how it wasnt actually rape because being drunk doesnt count they have drunk sex with their so alllll the timeee and theyre not being raped like i said they dont care about the victim matt which is sad they care about ripping amy down its disgusting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbh that first bit is messed up did she ever apologize for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,she actually just steals jokes there are lots of examples of parallel thinking in comedy but her jokes are verrrrrry similar to a lot of other comedians jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there was this really funny comment about how dick jokes were the bomb but vagina jokes were just ew self awareness status zero
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more like they love that that story by her brought out some shitry hipocrisy by a lot of feminists but cant stand that she is a woman who isnt stick thin and who is sexually active
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre on some shaky ground here when someone writes that they knew the person was blacked out had sex with them anyway that is a rapist saying i raped a person we do not need the other person to say anything pushing for survivors to have to testify on the public record as to whether or not they feel like their rape was valid is a shitty move
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i read the account that she gave of that incident it was definitely a rape and afaik she has never showed any remorse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shes on record as saying it was her rock bottom but i dont think she ever said sorry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the reason doctors sometimes assume that is because its true in many cases at utc radene replied to the thing is the reason doctors sometimes first assume that is because its true in many cases modern lifestyle of excessive stress often lack of sleep and generally being forced into a fight or flight stance as far as your body is concerned all the time lead to those symptoms its not exactly a disorder as much as its a biological consequence of the modern lifestyle but if she has been diagnosed and treated then she should merely notify the doctor of that and the matter should be settled past medical history shouldnt be ignored
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in this moment i am euphoric not because of a phony genders blessing but because i am enlightened by my cishetnormativity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no girls on the internet amirite fellas anybody who wants their identity that isnt cispenisman to be acknowledged is an attention whooooore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cis man logic tree does this please the peen yes no i am okay with this grr i am upset at this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is it about fucking assholes that causes them to believe anything that strays from normal aka straight white male is obviously just for attention
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that is some good bi erasure and just two days after bisexual visibility week ended too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ahhhhahahahaha ohh geeeeez heres what i got growing up genderqueer beat up by peers assaulted and harassed by police i didnt choose this shit the first half of my life probably wouldve been a lot better if i wasnt genderqueer but sure im born this way for attention i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and thats not even as bad as surgery and hormones can do a good job of turning a round faced boy into a female looking thing there are a few examples of transgendered people who look as attractive as him but i guess the voice is the hardest part to change fuck his other shitty comments too are others surprised hes a rthedoland poster
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good god reddit keep seems to somehow lower its own bar on how shitty it will treat other people if they arent astraight white male
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because everybody who isnt a straight cis guy is whoring for attention
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if my boyfriend were bisexual just for attention he would be out of the closet to like more than two people but hes not because of little shits like this fuck yourself reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a redditorim a redditorim actually an attentionseeking redditorim a redditor edit omg i didnt expect all these upvoats and attention for being a hateful bigot parroting just for attentionthanks kind predditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae sexual orientation is only for attention
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im gayim a lesbianim actually an attention whorei am transgender at utc valhallen replied to im gay im a lesbian im actually an attention whore i am transgender
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its bad to be queer but white people feel that they need a white syudent union
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit complains about sjws getting offended by everything actually gets angry at other peoples sexual orientation or gender identity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cispenisman worst superhero ever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they have never bothered to try to empathize with people different from them instead they project whatever helps their frail selfesteem the most onto others
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for those privileged by the status quo wanting to do anything but blend in is incomprehensible why would you go against the norm when the norm is that which comforts supports reinforces and provides for you all you get from going against the status quo when youre privileged by it is notoriety attention etc of course theyre apparently oblivious to the fact that gay trans racialized and other marginalized people generally did not sign up for being the other in this society but its so comfortable to pretend that everyones reality is exactly the same as our own so they jump to the omg ur attention slur shit real quick
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one pays any attention to them in real life and they assume everyone is as starved as they are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and even if they were doing it for attention grr youre an attention thats why im giving you attention with my casual hate and death and rape threats duhhh if you think theyre just doing it for attention why dont you just ignore them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats why queertrans people are so frequently closeted because we love the attention
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously i used to know a white guy that said i was a special snowflake for being mixed race yeah i totally chose who gave birth to me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone came out as bisexual on a talk show in my country the news headlines said he came out as gay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not the traditional lgbt thing its from the video where the third one was pansexual fucking insidious and disgusting but not bi erasure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just curious why do you keep calling that person him obviously that person wants to be referred to as a girl and has gone to great lengths to appear as a girl so why be an asshole and use him anyway i wanna be called a helicopter nobodys gonna call me a helicopter no but u guize the helicopter meme it is just le joak nothing to do with transbashing dont know what youre talkin bout
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,into a female looking thing thing well thats not dehumanizing s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but why wont people pay attention to me for being a white guy its not faaaaaair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,slightly worse than floridaman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey batman have you heard about my shlong yeah it only goes up for natural hair colored modestly dressed teenage girls who think feminism is a jewish plot to subjugate the white man hey where are you going
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck it they wanna be helicopters ill call them a helicopter ill also gladly treat them like i would treat a helicopter for example covering my ears when they make noise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,removing this as it sounds like peenpinions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh for fucks sake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even if it was ever funny that time passed httpswwwredditcomrshitredditsayswikihelicopter nothing is funny enough to withstand that kind of wear and thats entirely regardless of contenttastefulnessoffense bucket go a well every day inevitably the bottom ago drop out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,opeenions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jeez that ethics in journalism line is still being pushed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hours ago he made the following comment what a cunty nigger faggot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are klansman banned form blm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well youre not missing much because rblackladies is one of the most hardcore militant racist subs on all of reddit i can think of a few more than would take that title
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if they want to give someone emotional support they are free to quit posting their bullshit so that my faith in humanity is restored but something tells me they arent quite sincere i wonder why i feel that way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because mutually exclusive events are logically unsound no one in kia can be trusted for support particularly when it comes to bigotry or sensitivity towards rape you need to be trustworthy about those things to support someone going through that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually its about ethics in silky manageability
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it turns out when you vote for a racist prick racial minorities dont want anything to do with you it turns out when you vote for a rapist people who have been raped dont want anything to do with you it turns out that when you support a movement entirely based on the desire to shit on women who work on video games women dont want anything to deal with you who wouldve fucking thought
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i used to be banned from roffmychest because i once commented in tia when i messaged the mod about it they explained that those kind of subs were linked to hate speech harassment etc and said they would lift the ban if i disavowed hate subs which i did think of it this way if i was hiring a school counsellor and they mentioned in the interview that they follow milo yiannopolous on fb and that they think trumps victims are just attentionseeking then id throw out their resume because they clearly dont have the intelligence and decency needed to be empathetic to victims of trauma
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow almost all the comments in that thread are awful thecheeto has really infiltrated the whole website
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why cant i want ethics in journalism to harass women for playing and making video games a republican serial offender of sexual assault for president and to offer emotional support to people who need it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why cant i be a member of groups that explicitly hate black people and that make fun of rape victims and be welcomed by black women at the same time i thought the constitution protected my from the consequences of my actions reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is insane how hard some people are trying to divide the users of reddit into tiny groups who have to hate each other maybe if you stopped trying to spread hate people wouldnt have as much a problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gee i wonder why rape victims dont want to hear from someone who voted a sex fiend for president
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you answered your own question
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because youre a dumpster fire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,conservatism empathy pick one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i see someones looking to get hired at breitbart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because youre mentally incapable of doing so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i got banned from a subreddit for black ladies for black people hair and for rape victims to get help just because i posted to rkotakuinaction why cant i want ethics in journalism a republican president and to offer emotional support to people who need it in reply to xfceisbae on one more thing to add i absolutely hate how powermods or super mods ban people who post in rtd thats is so dumb i only go to rtd for the memes because they are really funny at times why do i get auto banned from rjokes for it at utc fairlycommonpepe wrote i got banned from a subreddit for black ladies for black people hair and for rape victims to get help just because i posted to rkotakuinaction i never went to those subs i honestly didnt even know they existed before they banned me it is insane how hard some people are trying to divide the users of reddit into tiny groups who have to hate each other why cant i want ethics in journalism a republican president and to offer emotional support to people who need it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what bothers me though about the autoban system on some subreddits is that i got autobanned from roffmychest because i gave contra to some idiot on rtumblrinaction i was banned when my grandpa died when my so cheated on me and i am still banned today
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because dude that means they cant trust you to actually help if you dont get that misogyny is a problem you dont know how it affects people and you are not a safe person for women to be around especially ones seeking healing from misogynistic trauma if you dont get that misogyny is a problem you probably wont get that white supremacy is a problem and so youre probably not safe for black people either sorry man you gotta earn that shit just like the rest of us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like how they slipped that republican president in there like wait kotakuinaction is doing what now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats the problem here most women voted for trump and i havent seen trump supporters outside of the internet be mean all the shitty people have been hillary supporters going on about how its her turn instead of actual lefties like bernie being elected
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only when convenient other times kia is a sub for pushing against sjw culture ot whatever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i wanted ethics in journalism the last place id be visiting is a fucking gamergate community
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why cant i hold all this ethics in journalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean it is possible that some people literally joined thinking that this was what it was about in the first placeand are super confused as to why they are getting labeled sexistsbut i still bet that demographic is slim
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gee i wonder why those subs banned him hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are members of the american nazi party banned from joining the antidefamation league why are members of nom or focus on the family barred from manning the phones at the trevor project why arent there any pig farmers on the mercy for animals board of directors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why cant i advocate white supremacy and civil rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,make america great again for white men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nonblack people stay wanting our energy and time 😒
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously how is this confusing at all you post regularly in a sub that harasses women who work in video games and are trying to change the male culture and expect to be allowed to post in a sub for harassment victims thatd be like a rapistrapeapologist being allowed into a rape survivors support group in real life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh fuckkkkk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haaaaa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ethics in shampoo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im still banned from offmychest even after messaging the mods though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i got banned from roffmychest for saying the word pssy in reference to my own actual literal pssy its kind of weird what you can get banned for sometimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that sub was alwyas weird for me i got banned there on my old account so i dont go there cuz of site rules the last time i was therethe post that got me banned it was a thread about someone who empathized with some yr old woman itend to see teens as kids so i would usually say girl but idk how most other people see those in their late teens so ima go with woman here lol who was suing her parents cuz they cut her off for some reason and refused to pay for her college and everyone is getting on the parents and im like wait the parents are assholes but parents have literally no obligation to pay an yr olds way for anything so this lady has no right to sue them for shit and she should be happy they paid what they did i was really taken back that some people actually feel entitled to their parents money idk maybe my experience colors my view i grew up in a poor household and i have been working to pay my own way since i was becuase i lied to the state and told them i was so i could get a work permit i paid my way thru college and highschool so im like would i have like to have my parents pay my way thru school hell the fuck yes was i in anyway entitled to my moms money hell no that got me promptly banned lol i guess i wasnt letting people vent and why i cant complain about being banned from a sub designed to let people vent lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when you put it that way its because youre probably the reason they need emotional support in the first place edit not you personally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought the constitution protected my from the consequences of my actions the white dipshits who think thats what the constitution does are embarrassments to humanity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think george w bush tried to have both but that didnt work out so good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you could try messaging the mods
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats kind of you but the guy has an extensive history of altright shitposts he knows why it happened but boy does it get upvotes to pretend he doesnt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well thats just demonstrably untrue simply taking any of trumps political stances severely inhibits your ability to be considered nice polite maybe insidiously polite but then have you ever actually witnessed a trump rally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i havent seen trump supporters outside of the internet be mean the uptick of hate crimes wasnt enough for ya receiptbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most women voted for trump i havent seen trump supporters outside of the internet be mean just because you ignore it doesnt mean it doesnt happen all the freaking time all the shitty people have been hillary supporters going on about how its her turn instead of actual lefties like bernie being elected hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha its her turn is something ive only ever heard from antihillary people who talk about her like she feels entitled and youre just completely ignoring the berniebros who hated hillary so much they said theyd vote for trump of course we dont know how much of them did in the end but still
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you telling me to pm you my butt and calling me a bro or are you telling me to pm you my buttbro im so confused
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but muh louis ck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why arent there any pig farmers on the mercy for animals board of directors unjerk arent there free range farmers who would be sympathetic to a group that opposes factory farming or does mfa oppose even free range
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why cant i advocate civil rights for white supremacists ftfy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,alternatively ive gone with make america hate again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your attempt to remove emotion from ethical concerns is just another form of extremism the reason you dig into it is because it promises to protect you from the emotional pain of being wrong by taking a rational middle ground you comfort yourself that you cant be wrong that you really understand the world but in reality your ideas are rafted on a series of emotionally evocative images and principles for want of a better word just like everybody elses youre correct because you cant be extreme because youre in the centre grounded atop pride rock seeing all the light touches how convenient that you also get societal confirmation from the moderate majority for doing so but that cant possibly have any bearing because youre logos through and through the kind of ideology that fancies itself contrarian whilst writing a regular column for vanity fair and decrying fringe opinions as if they were the whim and will of a presiding tyrant plagued by scientism and whitecentrism keen to present balance but keener still to present balance with a tone biased toward the positive outcomes like so many who talk of balance when defending a society wholly out of balance by treating the oppressed and oppressor the same you end up drowning the oppressed and only making the oppressor wet up to the knees remember empathy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre going to have to elaborate on what youre attempting to say if you want anyone to engage in any extended fashion in what sense do you think political activists are being hypocritical and defining things such that they cant be held accountable to their own rules
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,try again they probably missed it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did they explain why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we get an incredible volume of modmail due to this autoban in addition to our regular modmail issues so we do miss some especially if its fallen off the past hundred or so messages if you havent seen modmail imagine your dm inbox with fully threaded messages we also look for short clear answers to the questions we pose and if theres any hint of noncooperation we will disengage as we simply do not have time to deal with it please find the original ban notification respond to it and clearly state that you will cooperate with the terms described and we should be able to process it within a day thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he said he tried to have both but the second was a lie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i did by the time i was banned but they never responded
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,free range is a feel good buzzword for most parts its almost always used to squeeze more out of you because you think youre being ethical the rule of thumb is if you dont see the animal raised infer it didnt live a happy life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,problem with that is it never stopped
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just use the line they themselves do make america white again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is a great takedown of the le logical rational youhaveemotionsyoulose viewpoint remember empathy to quote the great uvorpaleskimo empathy cant be sold or fucked so whites have no use for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like so many who talk of balance when defending a society wholly out of balance by treating the oppressed and oppressor the same you end up drowning the oppressed and only making the oppressor wet up to the knees preach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well thats a shame my understanding was that most subs like that were willing to listen to ban appeals if you still feel like you need to get stuff off your chest my inbox is open
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,obama care has been a mixed and stunted blessingcurse but to pretend or even just imply that everyone is worse off with it is bullshit the change that people voted for was the demonisation of the other in american society thats what trump promised and euphemised it was a celebration of venom and a loss for the disenfranchised
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,see thats the narrative but the sole targets of antisjws are anyone who insinuates that any kind of change towards further civil rights is necessary for example feminists who are the epitome of what selfproclaimed antisjws hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,local co ops are a good bet but they can be pretty expensive ymmv
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it stopped officially hating in certain ways trump got elected by basically saying hed officially support the old ways of hate again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sigh true they just feel more legitimizedemboldenedempowered now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pretty sure you could sell empathy if you tried hard enough isnt that what therapists are pretty much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not defining things at all because the general assumed definition of shitting on is not literally defecating on but rather disparaging honestly the bit about a hirsute massive white man has been pulled from nowhere as at no point did i even vaguely imply the gender race or size of the person disparaging women nor was donald trump at all relevant to the imagery being used even accepting your premise your request for an objective metric or a defined mechanism described with clean positivist statements seems a bit ridiculous when what youre latching onto is a casual comment on a circlejerk subreddit and i still have no idea what you mean to imply with the women are only x of programmers bit honestly your cuckservative imagery is even more disturbing is this seriously what you imagine when you see these words i cant imagine what kind of world in the sense of your viewpoint not literal world you live in i also dont understand why you think that i was trying to psychologically or rhetorically manipulate people when a majority of the people that saw my comment were already in agreement ie i have no reason to do such a thing and am just exaggerating a bit for relief the extreme right does something very similar to the extreme left reads like horseshoe theory which is as usual iffy at best edit and i still havent gotten a real response as to what you perceive to be hypocritical of said standards
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is a visual statement invoking in the readers imagination a visual of a woman laying prostrate as a hirstute massive donald trump white man squats over her chest and proceeds to defacate this is infuriating to anyone who believes in womens rights and manipulates the sympathetic reader into a state of anger laffo youre like the kid who didnt read the book but has to write about it with a word count requirement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but the accusations against bill ended up leading to his impeachment trump was voted in with similar or worse allegations everyone here agrees im certain with the notion that bill probably deserved more than he got which only makes trump more absurd and tragic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i appreciate that thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all across the south the majority of jim crow remains largely in effect mainly voting stuff not the visible things like schools and buses similarly in the north and on the west coast police can essentially act as unrestricted paramilitaries what with army surplus and the cult of the police that target poor and black communities with impunity so i would argue it did not officially stop hating
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were still here to knock em back down
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive struggled with that idea myself ideally a good therapist has a set of tools they can teach to patients in order to improve problems and be a voice that challenges hurtful trains of thought unfortunately most people are not equipped to be able to assist folks with mental illnesses ive had to learn it the hard way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its less selling empathy and more being a skill trainer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well he is a kid who hasnt read a book
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sides all of which the accusations didnt start flying until after he was in office he was not elected in the face of scandal lmao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you got banned from rrape we can take you off ban i suspect that the mods over at offmychest are just inundated with trolls you can probably imagine that the troll rate has been exceedingly high lately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i need to hear that and be reminded of that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they just unbanned me i wont comment in hatesubs ever again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,happy ending
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont have anything to say about voat or any other wacky stuff like that i just wanted to clean my comment history have a great day and be excellent

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,removed the votes werent for the edited comment try rsrsmythos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,welp i just had to delete my twitter account because my parents found out about it and they dont agree with my political views which is just absolutely great all of this because i told them i support lgbt rights now all of the sudden im just not ready to go to college fuck financial dependency fuck colleges for costing dollars a year its like no matter what i do im trapped in this shitty town full of shitty people rant so how was your day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,none of my family nor my girlfriend respects my political views and they always mock me for them yesterday was worse than ever before it really ticks me off because they are extraordinarily important to me and while i respect the fact that they could be seen as extreme i have spent years developing them throughout my life it is just discouraging when my loved ones immediately write my beliefs off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,excited i just applied for chipotle yesterday and got emailed today for an interview wednesday i had friends work there at the place im interviewing at so i hope i get i

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had a dinner party last night and i gotta say my liberal bubble is the best we drank at least bottles of wine among people while we covered every topic under the sun the final conversation ended around and now im up early to procrastinate cleaning my house edit the srs fan club is always hilarious in regards to my friends and i drinking wine drinkers are the worst if you were in a bar everyone around you had stories for days about the pompous little shits that aired their fauxintellectual windbaggery around like a dick if you stayed home good do that more and spare people the knowledge of your existence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im wondering what to do with my life i have quit my job as a bartender and my masters in molecular biology i just became one with time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have mango tango and most of the double dragon neon soundtrack stuck in my head
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my daughter came home from her friends house with two goldfish she won at a festival now i have to figure out what to do with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,congrats hope the big day goes great
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol who actually cares about them i just remembered that they exist thanks to your post
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you live your life in the shadow of your parents approval there will be a long long list of things youll have regrets about by the time you hit dont know how old ya are but go for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do it take it from someone whos seen it happen dont spend your whole life afraid of your parents itll destroy you and everything you love at the end of the day standing up for yourself and what you believe in and becoming a person you want to be is far more important than people biologically related to you wholl spend their whole lives trying to oppress you ive seen the mistake made lost people i cared about more than the world dont end up like they did
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please stay safe good luck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think there are resources out there but i dont know where
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quick srs lets doxx everyone named adam
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my liberal bubble is the best this sounded weird to me as a communist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,keep one give the other way assuming you can afford to keep one fish i mean
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,d a m n s o n
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not going to state them here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no its not their approval i want i discarded that thought a long time ago im just afraid they might react badly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,eve was an srs mod
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im fine with srs being a popular front myself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well one has died well see if the other survives the night
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my mom called me freaking out when i changed my facebook profile picture to the rainbow thing she told me i didnt even understand what i was supporting she blamed my university for brainwashing me into being a liberal she then forbid my younger sister from going to the same university as me my sister is already super liberal as a recent high school grad like yesterday was graduation so im not sure how she got brainwashed but all in all it really wasnt a big deal i still talk to my mom we still hang out and laugh sometimes we just disagree and think it upset her at first but she got over it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your own safety is the most important concern right now youll have your whole life to fight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck temperature water purity lack of food
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a bit of a fallacy to dismiss all radical views as inherently devoid of merit at one point things like abolition were radical views
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think it was the living in a plastic bag then being transferred to a toosmall bowl then having the bowl carried from one house to another if the other survives the night well get it an actual tank with a filter and actual space to move around in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aww poor feesh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yup the other one is still here which means now i need to find money from somewhere to get an actual tank and stuff
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wish you the best of luck if nothing else family friends or other kids might be able to take it off your hands
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can the altright move on from funny memes to something more serious holy shit like i want to laugh at them but im not sure if i should just feel bad for them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there was a thread yesterday on how manson used techniques from dale carnegie the amount of comments asking to be taught these techniques was fucking disturbing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we mostly just teach each other how to avoid creepy dudes on the street but whatever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is that subreddit for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so they just admit to being a cult now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if somebody hacks the antidoxxing insurance client list
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and srs is now how i get my news now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,offshoot trp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,misogynists who cant get laid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lead by the one and only uciswhitemailstrom on his new account
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh wow subreddits multiply like bunnies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit where children cant selfidentify but we should lower the age of consent tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im an eagle scout from a rural troop these people dont know shit about the boy scouts and if they were boy scouts they dont live by the same law i do a scout is trustworthy loyal helpful friendly courteous kind obedient cheerful thrifty brave clean reverant nowhere in that law does it say born men these laws are valid codes for anyone to live by not your immature boys club edit born men is inaccurate i should have written assigned male at birth that being said i believe that there should be no gendered component to the scouts as well cis and trans boys and girls would all benefit from the scouts thank you ujrslayerofrajang for the reality check
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you should have seen the yikyak feed at my school people were losing their goddamn minds there was a dude who was completely convinced that little girls were going to dress up as boys just to join the boy scouts because thats totally a thing but he didnt believe that trans boys exist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,young cis boy im not a girl im a boy reddit yes of course young trans boy im not a girl im a boy reddit but wait how does this kid actually know that huh how could a kid possibly know that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,by their own logic these fuckwads are clearly too underdeveloped to identify as cis should be forced to live as trans until theyre deemed mentally capable by a panel of therapists with a financial incentive to string them along
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually theyre right you have to be to be able to register for a transgender license although you can take the test if youre sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wtf lol transgender children they should be taken away from their parents not enrolling in boy scouts what in the actual hell people goddamnit rule
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also a lot of shitty comments on rupliftingnews about this im on mobile so i cant effort post right now but heres more of reddit being awful
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that last comment makes me want to throw up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trustworthy redditors lie through their teeth when they brigade other threads and pretend to be blacks gays or whatever it is they want to be loyal the only thing they are loyal to are their dicks thats not the kind of loyalty the boy scouts need helpful redditors have no moral guidance to offer support to female for victims and cheers for the rapists how helpful of them friendly only to their own little cliques and other minorities when they can use them as leverage against another minority courteous see how redditors treat women kind to rapists pedophiles and white terrorists obedient redditors flout a shit load of rules by spreading hate speech and being dicks cheerful redditors exchanged all of their cheerfulness for hate anger and perverse joy over making their targets suffer thrifty they buy reddit gold to honour bigoted remarks thats fucking wasteful brave redditors are scared shitless of any mass efforts to speak out against them and dislike confronting rational people alone preferring to stay within their circle jerks clean redditors are disgusting and the scum of the earth reverant redditors are reverant about all the wrong things tldr redditors have no place in dictating what the boy scouts should do if they dont even have the qualities themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trans men are born men their body might develop wrong for whatever reason but who we are is not determined by our genitals regardless of what they used to be called they have always been men im a trans woman i did not become someone else ive always been me ive always been a woman but only now does my external appearance and shape and presentation reflect who i really am
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your gender is unknowable except by strangers on the internet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah no concept of gender for kids but the boy scouts and girl scouts exist for some reason
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,buhbut boys need a space where boys can be boystm and do boy things without those pesky grils getting in the way just like in the real world s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry i didnt mean that to come out like it did im in favor of opening up the boy scouts to all people cis women as well i intended on rejecting the notion that there should be a gendered component to scouts at all but i see now that i wasnt clear thank sincerely for the correction ill edit some context in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you for that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont give a shit about what you think go cry about me being nice to people somewhere you can get validation or is negative attention enough to satisfy your narcissism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we also learnt that pluto was a planet whats his point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mfw cis people have a hard time comprehending that theyre wrong on at least different levels
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dispel the myth of xx and xy chromosomes they dont exist apparently the straw keeps burning
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mfw all that stuff i learned in anatomy and physiology was not correct at utc anaveragewhiteguy replied to mfw all that stuff i learned in anatomy and physiology was not correct
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every single time ive gotten into this kind of argument with someone their respose is something like well thats just an anamoly it doesnt really count
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ten is a bit low of a starting point tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpenwikipediaorgwikixyfemale httpenwikipediaorgwikixxmale facts are fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well to the average cis white male everyone else doesnt count
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you ignore the data that contradicts my opinion then im correct
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah thats usually the point where im like aaarrrggghhh why am i even bothering to explain this to you redditors may claim to love science but theyre not going to let it get in the way of their own prejudice no way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and even then there are women out there who dont realize theyre genetically xy ex complete androgen sensitivity syndrome until they get a karyotype test or surgery done
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fucking love science as long as i can use it to confirm my shitty worldviews
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not to stray into rule x territory here but i cant help but think that they specifically mean that helping an abused woman purely for the sake of trying to get with her is shitty which i kind of agree with thatd give me massive trust issues and probably end up making things worse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,helping and loving an abused woman is a shitty thing to do in reply to zammies on its a very niceguy lyric and there are a lot in this song though from watching the actual music video for it it seems to suggest the woman is actually in an abusive relationship and theres a shout out to the domestic violence hotline at the end at utc istoleatimelord wrote that makes it worse imo im not gonna try to help a battered woman under the pretense of actually giving a shit and then be like get with me instead thats fucking shitty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for what its worth i kind of agree this person didnt even follow many of the posting guidelines which leads me to believe that they are new to the sub the comment score wasnt included in the title but the worst offence is that it wasnt a direct quote it was a heavily editorialized version which is against the rules also i kind of get what you were trying to say its not okay to help a battered woman just because you want to get with her though in defense of op i would say that your comment though not shitty on its own merit misrepresented the song lyric because it doesnt imply hes helping her to just to have sex with her but just that he thinks she should be treated better anyway personally and i could be wrong but i expect this will be removed at some point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,op has never met a muslim woman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just because you see muslims on the streets not committing atrocities does not mean theyre all innocent theres a reason you almost never see a muslim woman smile in reply to on i want to admit something i hate to admit but im being worn down defending muslims its not that im not compassionate towards each good person its just that it takes a lot more energy to be understanding i wish we could as humanity get past holding on to the idea of religion what a waste of human potential at utc wrote not all ideologies are created equal and not all ideologies deserve defending anyone who believes there is no difference between youi and a staunch believer of islam is simply ignorant and too much ignorance can be very dangerous just because you see muslims on the streets not committing atrocities does not mean theyre all innocent theres a reason you almost never see a muslim woman smile
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its honestly incredible the overwhelming majority of muslim women ive met have been outwardly happy people reddit twists and warp your brain with racism so that you feel like you know all about ppl youve never met
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,right one of my neighbors is muslim she always says hi and waves to me when i pass her planting flowers or putting up decorations im sure she has bad days but for fucks sake people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow holy shit i think its time to remind reddit about that white dude from that shitty band that was raping babies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literal white supremacist meme check whole story is a local news piece that was hatejerked to the front page check way too many other shit comments check must be roddit dot com front page of the fuckin internet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,considering that a church was shoot up by a young white boy i think black people should never lower their guards around young white men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont mind me just regurgitating literal neonazi propaganda average reddit poster
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,never relax around blacks at utc woodyfly replied to never relax around blacks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deportmayo seriously though how they never thought to apply their inane logic to men or white people is beyond me its almost like theyre just cowardly racists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,am white can confirm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but you need to make it kinda rhyme to make it true obviously dont worry though i got your back its never alright around whites boom truthed for ya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh and lets not forget all the white terrorists this year like dylan roof those bozos that took over that small government property those dudes that set bombs to blow up an apartment complex with lots of refugees and that guy who killed a couple cops because he was mad he was removed from a football game for going full white supremacist there conservatives want us to forget but dont
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,according to hate mail im officially a terrorist sympathiser for not unilaterally decrying the concept of islam
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i learnt today that my brothers friend was to lazy to register to vote hed drive hours to enter a smash tournament but registering to vote wow too much effort
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sure its been pointed out already but yall ever notice how back in redditors saw fundies as such a threat to our nation because they might teach our children that climate change and evolution isnt real and now we have someone in the white house who doesnt believe in climate change and might be putting someone who doesnt believe in evolution in his cabinet and a vast amount of redditors are just so glad to have him funny that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,prepare for the shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the edge of seventeen omg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you guys have any favorite podcasts any subject
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so im not really sure how serious rtheschulz are but theyre pretty funny in a german way also i only just realised that the nutlords trumpets mean mainstream media when they say msm i thought that initialism meant something else whoops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i endured the first hour of jordan petersons appearance on the joe rogan podcast just to hear what kind of nonsense he spewed i have never heard anyone being so deliberately obtuse about a wide plethora of issues from pronouns to flagrantly i mean flagrantly misrepresenting bill i had to turn it off when he said whats wrong with dressing as a mexican on halloween id love to hear everyones thoughts on this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im gettin me some juicy hate mail right now i feel bad for milking it though i probably wont say anything the next time he pms me the dudes clearly off his rocker
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my alarm clock is conspiring to make me late for class or i just forgot to set it either way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yall are silly gooses with your silly ideas and silly ways stop being so silly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know whats a good album ive heard lately american boyfriend by kevin abstract reminds me alot of american football in the teenage lovey stuff since kevin is bi theres some bi undertones in some songs great album
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if theyre harassing you dont forget to report them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sometimes i dont know which group i have more contempt for those who actively voted for trump or those who stood on the sidelines when their country needed them the most
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors will throw away every single one of their values if it means nonwhite people have it even a little bit tougher than they did yesterday
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ehh i dont know that the fundie hating group and the prodrumpf group have much of an overlap though reddit is a big place and both wereare just very vocal groups not necessarily very big ones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,somebody was raped and the perpetrator wasnt a foreigner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the roosterteeth trinity of the the roosterteeth podcast off topic and always open are pretty good depending on your interests
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the doughboys is super funny one of them is a bonafide cuck too so that should interest some of yall also the next picture show is really good if you like movies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how did this get made is admirably funny a lot of the time and iffy only a very small amount of the time one of my favourite episodes is their look back on gods of egypt and how absolutely nothing in that movie ever worked even a bit edit also decoder ring theatre for your dose of oldtimey radio shows about canadas greatest superhero the red panda and his sidekick the flying squirrelhes the brains and shes the musclethe only one in their extensive support network who can drive worth a damn in the dangerous streets of depressionera toronto and the droll quasinoire styles of black jack justice aided by trixie dixon girl detective one of their episodes is a riff movie riffs and has a certain forrester guest they go from comedy to suspense to dieselpunk twists on wwii and back with ease though should mention theres a slight hangemhigh slant to red pandas crimefighting based a lot on the creators own views and at least two episodes that put periodappropriate homophobic insults in the mouths of the heroes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for the longest while i was really confused because i had only seen that acronym used to refer to men who have sex with men i was like why are they organizing casual gay hooku oh of course it doesnt mean that why am i not surprised that its about shitting on any media that doesnt play in their court
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you usually listen to the joe rogan podcast
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah ill stick with my silly ways of calling homophobes racists and misogynists what they are the fact that they dont like me doing it is why it needs doing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aww banned me guess he needs to suck it up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like this guy wringing his hands over obvious satire standing in the middle of the road is illegal and thus its okay for you to be intentionally run down id bet anything this person denies moral realism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ets is more or less ok for the most time except for the triggered joak of course but when it goes bad then it goes bad in a big way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you forgot the part where the clinton campaign didnt even bother to show up in states and counties obama worked hard and won didnt even call the mayor of a blue bastion like madison or where they didnt update their getoutthevote roster until midoctober so lets not forget to heap some contempt on dnc leadership with friends like these etc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think thats what pisses me off most people measuring personal success by the distance between them and the person behind not against their own growth i may be losing out year on year against the elite but im losing out less than that person so im a better person and if i fuck up their chances ill be even better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a whole lot of rascism and antifeminism tied up in the new atheist movement i wouldnt be at all surprised if most of them voted for trump
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as transhivemind said i dont think its too absurd to think new atheists would vote for trump because of his antifeminism and opposition to pc culture and all that hoopla but you make a good point i guess its just interesting to see the shift in ideology of the userbase as a whole rather than the individual users themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love them because theyre so varied you never know what youre going to get also theyre like hours long
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i thought it meant that whoops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,check out the ny times exit poll for other religious affiliation it looks like its behind the paywall now but iirc the trump vote was unusually high for a group that was not christian jewish or muslim
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jesus christ i hate how these people think that caring about women abuse and caring about men abuse are mutually exclusive you can care about both of them ffs and nobody is forgetting about mens problems while pointing out womens these people really cant handle even one instance of someone not talking about their problems theyre like yolds crying because mommy and daddy dont give them enough attention its seriously fucking annoying jfc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont forget men are abused too can we please talk about men and not women everyone fucking remembers because redditeurs like this always derail the conversation any time anyone tries to discuss violence against women the top several comments about this photo were all about abuse against men even though the image was meant to provide a dialogue about violence against women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i knew as soon as i saw that post what the comments would be like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whatever happened to their precious men are physically stronger than females everywhere and in everything and men rule and females drool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,further down theres a link to where he got the statistic from and he got it from a study performed by a mens rights group
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,frustrating that its only for ending domestic abuse against women when men are at a close statistic of being domestically abused as well at utc replied to frustrating that its only for ending domestic abuse against women when men are at a close statistic of being domestically abused as well httpiimgurcomscabjthpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it ignores that most dv victims are women there are absolutely men issues but they never seem to want to rectify them only shit on women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unfortunately they only ever bring this up when its used to shut down discussion of domestic violence its always men get abused too so feminists are bad rather than hey this is a serious social issue you can do x y z to help stop it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id rather play runescape and that communitys shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait werent they just getting angry about not talking about how men are also abused but men dont want conciliatory access to your victimcard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,scrolling through it like im sure someone will bring the focus back to violence against womenokay still menstill menwhy am i even surprised by this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,huh thats kind of how i feel about the places with high percentages of confederate flags being displayed in public
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sure the admins will swoop right on in to issue sitewide bans for this violent rhetoric any second now annnnny second
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some nations are full of uncivilized trash that frankly im not ok sharing the earth with i know the feeling i wouldnt give any space to americans either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually the comment kind of proves its own self right im not ok with sharing the same universe as this racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,genocide bash the fash is the real issue
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some nations are full of uncivilized trash that frankly im not ok sharing the earth with in reply to josefernandes on what the fuck that sounds like something out of those fucked up fairy tales hard to imagine people like that still exist at utc wrote i hate to say it but some nations are full of uncivilized trash that frankly im not ok sharing the earth with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all nations are full of uncivilized trash ftfy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats how i feel about america
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sherman missed a few
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well acskhuallyieieyyy thats about having pride in my history and totally not about being a racist piece of trash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but its not violent rhetoric its lazy violence supporting rhetoric s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know the feeling i wouldnt give any space to americans whites either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,another gif was posted showing that she did survive with apparently minor injuries and was able to climb down with rescuers thank goodness it is still very sad to watch never been so relieved about a gif i hope the woman filming that gets what she deserve disgusting piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reconstruction ended too soon we should have treated the south like germany japan
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some nations are full of uncivilized whites that frankly im not ok sharing this earth with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao ulysses grant was a corrupt piece of shit but honestly we were kinda fucked to begin with because muh southern pride
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah that works great
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pedophiles are disgusting at what the actual fuck burn these fucking servers to the ground salt them throw them ito space for a poor advanced society to find them so the destroy the world fuck this shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pedophiles are fine in reply to on pedophiles are disgusting at utc ryswick wrote pedophiles are fine molesting children is wrong httpiimgurcomiduxfvfpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and that attitude is why our justice system is fucked dont get me wrong for the worst of criminals this line of thinking is extremely tempting and part of me still firmly believes breivik deserves nothing less than a visit to the firing squad rather than the he got but if you want to stop this kind of behavior treating inmates like shit is not the way to go
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im glad to see the comments underneath seem to be pretty disturbed by it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but rape culture doesnt real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mras will be in there any minute to condemn the user for not taking male rape seriously anyyyyy time now just wait
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont like what president duterte is doing we need due process heinous crime happens cut his balls off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also reddit my world view is rational and in no way determined by my feefees
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but rape culture doesnt exist right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sure you only feel this way when a white bro gets stabbed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i sincerely hope they go to the worst prison in california and get raped and beaten everyday of the rest of their miserable shitty fucking lives at utc replied to what kind of fucking animals stab a man in front of his kids over a simple request to not blast vulgar music in a toy section of a walmart i sincerely hope they go to the worst prison in california and get raped and beaten everyday of the rest of their miserable shitty fucking lives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh brevik is serving a life sentence the traditional american concept of one doesnt exist though what he got in norway is effectively the same
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the justice system should be above vengeance even when it sucks and the person is a miserable piece of shit it makes the death penalty and other extreme punishments appealing but removing them from society is effective in protecting the society from them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah duterte and the philippines should all hang their heads in shame now i cant understand where theyre at john oliver should set them straight but if you kill over some loud music i hope the cops neuter you posthaste so love me love me love me im a redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he sentence doesnt include endless suffering or isolation so its hardly similarly effective american prisons seem to seek to punish as deeply as possible without regard to humanity or ethics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,classic srs fanboy law comes to save the day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because women arent being paid less to do the same work at utc cuddlyfreshsoftness replied to because women arent being paid less to do the same work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sargon of akkad and thunderfoot told me so it must be true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women that think they get paid less for the same work should get paid less dinobenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had the whole conservative upbringing thing so ive spent years opening doors literally no one has ever been bothered by this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sometimes i get really mad at women and use my imagination to try and justify that anger
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol they probably thought you were giving them your seat on the bus because they looked pregnant who stands up for half the population
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im an inconsiderate arsehole who never gave up a seat or held a door in my life but made up this story to avoid being called put on my bullshit behaviour because that totally wouldnt make me feel bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hold doors for everybody its polite but if you stand for only women who need seats thats weird right like century if youre giving someone your seat solely based on their gender thats contributing to a women are inferior mindset right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont let the door slam in whoevers face if theyre walking behind you and dont make a fucking stage production out of it if you do hold it this is some classic dae nice guys finish last bullshit like fuck redditors tend to think theyre so fuckin smart but cant figure out basic social behaviors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah except none of that ever happened this is just dae sjw bad pandering bullshit to rile up the nice guys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im just looking for any excuse to be rude to others
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh well i still do it for everyone just like saying hey to everyone i see on city sidewalks it just freaks people out sometimes maybe because people have actual reasons to be worried about randos saying hey
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,completely unbelievable a redditor was told something by a woman and that redditor listened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as a female supremacist i have never given anyone crap for holding a door open for me or giving up their seat for me this is the way it should be it is the natural order of things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fucking redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i held the door open for all women and after my experience with a woman telling me that she didnt need a man to open the door for her and it was sexist i felt the need to stop doing it i also stopped giving women my seat on the bus for the same reason at utc senorkerry replied to man i had some bad experiences when i moved from the south to boston i held the door open for all women and after my experience with a woman telling me that she didnt need a man to open the door for her and it was sexist i felt the need to stop doing it but i didnt stop doing it for dudes because they never complained only said thanks i also stopped giving women my seat on the bus for the same reason
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this definitely happened you guys me and all the other females frequently berate nice men for holding doors because were so emotional
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that seems a bit strange but presumably this redditor has opened the door for hundreds of women and men too so why should he stop being polite just because one feeeeeemale oppressed him by making a mountain out of a molehill i hold the doors open for anybody coming behind me i dont rush in front of someone to open the door for them yeah that would be a bit inappropriate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly the worst reaction ive ever had to opening the door for someone was no reaction at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is similar to living in the citybeing a waiterbeing a racist made me racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah this is what gets me about these constant complaints why only for women i hold the door for everyone always check to see if anyone is behind me before i let go of the door my husband too on a bus or whatever id give my seat to someone who looked like they needed it like for example an older person of any gender only focus on women and it looks like either you think this is or it looks like youre maybe trying to hit on her
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your life experience is probably pretty limited its ignorant to assume that others have similar social experiences as you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats like borderline rude in some cities hell its borderline insane if you consider the sheer number of people on the sidewalk in a city like say sf or new york youd be saying hey every few seconds hundreds if not thousands of times a day whotf needs to fleetingly notconnect to that many random strangers bit of a red flag honestly clutches pepper spray where im from you want to acknowledge the people you pass on the street you keep it to a polite nod like a normal person and its served me well everywhere ive been cant go wrong with a nod
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,likely not he probably just held the door open for a woman she didnt give him the adequate amount of sex probably zero so he angrily made up this scenario in his head and ran home to rant about it on altright reddit dot com upjerks around for the poor mans feefees
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think that first part is considered a slur around here any more because of its autism spectrum connotations its kind of redundant considering redditor anyway which already carries all the nonautism spectrum connotations as it is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i got the speech once at a coffee shop about twenty years ago but she came by my table about ten minutes later to apologize because shed spent the morning dealing with nice guys and id accidentally stumbled into the aftereffects
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,went shopping with my boyfriend a couple months ago and he held the door for me and like random people and one girl made a comment to her friend along the lines of oh look a white knight opening the door for us it was so cringey and she said it loud so it was obvious she wanted him to hear her she seemed like she was young though probably around or and full of teen angst
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but its other peoples fault that im a bigot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or that bullshit about a conservative is a liberal whos been mugged
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay i feel like there needs to be some clarification here everyone should hold the door open behind themselves for people coming in after them its weird imo to hold it open and let someone go through before you unless youre with them especially if you run up to open it for someone like a fucking dweeb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the same as who do only men get the draft most people respond by saying the draft is outdated and we should get rid of it reddit responds by wanting to include women in the draft here we have reddit wanting nobody to hold the door open for anyone instead of just opening the door for everyone its about dragging people down instead of doing something beneficial
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,must be different where i live i say hello or good day to most people i pass on the street no one freaks out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dunno plenty of liberals seem eager enough to fall in line with conservatives just block a highway or sit down during the national anthem or be queer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unless theyre like a little old lady carrying a bunch of groceries tbh even then i ask hey can i get that door for you as im running to the door
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well unless they freak outwardly you wouldnt know like when i first moved from dense city to a town two orders of magnitude smaller and wasnt used to the level of streethellos yet i did freak out a bit inwardly and then id quickly recover and nodsmilewave back it took me probably a year to get used to it i still jump a little sometimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well the original post used neckbeard which as accurate as it is has its roots in an antiautism spectrum slur barry deutsch cartoon explains things pretty well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hm i never considered that a simple act of friendliness would freak people out i may have to reconsider
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck gotta try and explain this to my boyfriend we were going to go as nckbeards for halloween maybe it could be replaced with edgelord mcfriendzone i usually use that name for all redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lgbtqai
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,eh again freak out is probably overstating it a bit no worries im sure youre just doing whats common in your area— and who can be mad at that as the romans do etc etc but in places where that isnt the norm people who insist on doing that should reconsider like if out of people react to your street hellos with startlement or frowny brows or mild alarm maybe lay off with it i think its weird that this is even a fight to so many streetgreeters i mean regardless of local norms presumably good morning isnt meant to evoke those feelingsresponses— thats not the desired effect so i dont get people who dont seem to a notice or b care that its not going over im being polite well not really etiquette is mostly in the eye of the beholder no i dont generally spend a lot of time thinking about this but now that i am it does seem a bit militant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditor is still a good costume
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,where i live not greeting is sometimes even offensive to some for example if old people walk by you and you dont formally greet them sometimes theyll ask you if you have no manners
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or you could just staple a bunch of garbage to your clothes light yourself on fire and go as reddit also drag a few corpses behind you while denying you have anything to do with them bonus points if youre in whiteface
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont forget the horse carcasses and the bats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rfunny suffers from the same problem as every rightwing comedian they try to tell a political joke but it ends up being a plain earnest rant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also from the comment when i told them that i have anxiety and autism they immediately changed stance and tone becoming sympathetic and soft in speech to me and apologized they literally apologized and treated him nicely once they learned of his disability even though he originally confronted them and interrupted their conversation lhitlerally fascism you guise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,blmism well thats a new one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,egalitarian may as well mean neonazi as far as i can tell i dont care to read about feminism but i get really uncomfortable when i think about it and i definitely dont want to introspect so i know im not sexist soooo 😒😒😒
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they were ranting at eachother about how inherently evil white men were yep that sounds like a real conversation that actually happened in the actual reallife world and totally not just in your imagination yep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly the same as how the nazis marginalized the jews where exactly are all these white male extermination camps
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in modern parlance theyd talk about how jew privilege was being used to oppress authentic germans and jewish income inequality was a major social problem because jews had more of it of course translation the skeletons say that there is injustice and unfair things happening in society know who else said things like that hitler about the jews top minds of reddit clearly worked overtime on this profound and enlightening analysis of history this is sitting at now too reddit delenda est
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they say that like theyre not their biggest fans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they assume every single white person is far better off than every single person of every single other denomination and skin color yeah because any feminist black lives matterist and sjwist has ever said that egalitarianism is great feminism blmism and sjwism are hate groups and dont care about real equality or civil rights most redditeurs seem to think that if a groupmovement doesnt presuppose that all individuals are equals regardless of gender ethnicity etc then they arent about real equality and that any groupmovement that recognises that some groups are more priveliged than others and attempts to get rid of this privelige thus making people equal is trying to take away their rights they ignore the very obvious set in stone fact that white privelige and male privelige are real things as an excuse to block out of their heads any movement that doesnt focus on them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,meanwhile whitelivesmatter is fine depsite white surpemacist ties
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you cant just tag ism onto the end of things and assume it makes you sound smart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they immediately assumed i was privileged just because of my skin color i hate to break it to you buddy but you are white privilege doesnt mean you have a great life with no hardships and nothing ever goes against you it means that because of how you look the world perceives and treats you differently im sorry if you feel like that diminishes your personal struggles somehow and they also assumed my mental state how do you know this are you just assuming they did egalitarianism is great feminism blmism and sjwism are hate groups and dont care about real equality or civil rights sjwism isnt a group and just because none of those is going out of their way to target the rights of white dudes who have some hardships in their life despite their white skin oh my god that doesnt mean they dont care about real equality i cant handle this pity party
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats totally true except that the groups arent coherent groups and to the extent that they are a group they are about equality andor civil rights while not using nazi tactics so its like a trumpism its factually false to the extent that its not fictional but it confirms what some people want to be true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,godwins law assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they were ranting at eachother about how inherently evil white men were and i was in a bad mood that day so i interrupted them and told them they were being sexist rthathappened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,times my opinion suddenly becomes legitimate on reddit when i explain that i am not white sure ok reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of all of the things that have happened this one has happened the most
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sjwism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ism ism ism ism ism ism ism ism its like theyre beatboxing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love the articles they posted like look how contradictory sjws are like has nobody actually noticed that its two different writers anybody whose actually worked in journalism knows youre going to have writers who dont agree and having both opinions represented in your op eds is good business its like if a website only includes one opinion its biased but if it includes two its proof that sjws are contradictory and will never be pleased
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,beeelemism essjaydoubleyewism wat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and i thought they loved nazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly the same exactly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha south park pc principal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant get drunk enough to think like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae le white genocide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the nazis did marginalize german jews with the nuremberg laws in the middle but the holocaust starting in the late and in other countries didnt bother with marginalization it went straight to brutal extermination so the idea is just nonsensical and ahistorical
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and then all the white men applauded me as i walk away with honor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stdhtxt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so being critical of white males makes you a hate group guys were becoming too pc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feminism blmism and sjwism are hate groups and dont care about real equality or civil rights the tactics are exactly the same as how the nazis marginalized the jews in reply to poemi on thats because sjws dont judge people based on what they actually dothey judge them based on their skin color sexual orientation and other preconceived labelscategories theyre living the exact opposite of mlks dream the marginally more intelligent among them will try to explain the hypocrisy away with metric tons of drivel about intersectional oppression but the bottom line is that they are more sexistracistetc then nearly all the people they bitch about at utc kingsgrave wrote i had an in person confrontation with a few of them at a grocery store a few months ago they were ranting at eachother about how inherently evil white men were and i was in a bad mood that day so i interrupted them and told them they were being sexist just as a side note i have huge social anxiety and you have to really provoke me to get me to converse in public i just wanted poptarts man and i couldnt focus on which one i wanted lmao anyway they immediately just mock laughed at me because im white and am privileged when i told them that i have anxiety and autism they immediately changed stance and tone becoming sympathetic and soft in speech to me and apologized i actually have those things didnt just use it to win an argument lmao so fucking hypocritical they immediately assumed i was privileged just because of my skin color and they also assumed my gender and my mental state all things they tell people not to do also ironically them trying to be sympathetic out of nowhere because they found out about my autism was incredibly patronizing and felt like they were pitying me ive seen sjws make several comments about these types of things regarding people with mental conditions yet ive encountered this type of shit more than once egalitarianism is great feminism blmism and sjwism are hate groups and dont care about real equality or civil rights reminded me of this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a slippery slope though first they treat you with respect and next thing you know youre being sent off to a concentration camp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reading the rest of his comments about the autistic community hes still a major asshole
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like something from rthathappened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black lives matterism i have no idea what they could possibly even mean by that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i can count on one hand the times i met selfproclaimed egalitarians who actually understood what the word meant and acted in a way that showed they gave a shit about anyone but themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate white men theyre top evil do you hate white men too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my yard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,strange how when jews were marginalized they were forced to live in ghettos nowadays when the word ghetto is used every murican thinks predominantly black neighbourhood unless you include the word lavender which makes it a predominantly lgbt neighbourhood yet they have the gall to claim these groups are the ones marginalizing whites its impressive that these guys can spin and warp the narrative to the point where the existence of black latino lavender and other ghettos just fly over their heads when they say protesters are as bad as nazis it may be terrifying but i want to see what they see cause it must be a terribly warped and funny world they percieve
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just another day at the office
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love it when the conservatives get upset because the woke proles wont also be racist so they just project racism onto economic discourse it shows just how quickly theyre guzzling that koolaid as they pretend that the copious amounts of blue pills theyre ingesting are actually red
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that one line is fucked up in at least three different ways efficient i especially like how they give an example for the second thing that is not a thing but not for the first whaddaya know about that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my flair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre not helping me better find a way to shut them down
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well you can but youd be wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh well i guess ocracy is my next best bet then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have no idea why my autism would make my white privilege go away
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just like any other special interest group they feel about them however best fuels the current tantrum
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you have my sword
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aww i was hoping itd be the other way around c
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao uhhuh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yesterday i was in a grocery store and saw two redditors talking to each other in the checkout lane at first they were only talking about dank memes and mcchicken sandwiches but then they slapped their dicks out on the conveyor belt and started masturbating to cosmo i tried to tell them that such behavior wasnt appropriate and they just laughed and told me they had free speech when the cashier threatened to get a manager they zipped back up made a comment comparing store managers to nazis and told the cashier straight to her face that their peens were not pleased she grimaced when they handed her their money they demanded that she smiled and refused to leave the line until she did she called the manager over and they called the police and now both redditors are serving life sentences literally happened just yesterday i swear its just as truthful as the linked comment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but like assuming that it did happen and they were in the wrong being very generous here his story amounts to i had this one interaction with some sjw types that rubbed me the wrong way so now i hate all movements that are even vaguely associated with them in my head so much logic and totally not exactly the same thing he was criticising then for ie profiling an entire group based on the actions of a few members
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,matterism a type of painting which emphasizes paint as a physical substance it became identifiable as a tendency in paris in the in the work of fautrier and dubuffet and became widespread in the still no clue what black lives matterism is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well it makes sense when you consider that they each view themselves as kings of the shit pile and everyone below them deserves an equal portion of their shit their understanding of egalitarianism made a hard stop at treating everyone else equally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,from my perspective the white men are evil
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hashtag all men god i love irl conversations
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how do you do fellow sjws
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sounds like a party
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so thats what the milkshake song was really about
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look look with your special flair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gotta be sensitive to white fragility being called racist is literally the worst thing that can happen to a white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sjwocracy seems legit now taking bets on when well see it in the wild
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a figure near wouldnt shock me it would probably be lower than the general black population similar to how feminist women are less likely to say they hate men than women generally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess we can speculate i speculate that your speculative figure is incorrect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know thats not true because she didnt falsely accuse them of rape for attention
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like regular matterism but each pictures includes a pack of white people crowding around it shouting that the paintings the real racist here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exterminate the white men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre so irritating and they get everywhere
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they came for my milkshake i came for their lives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being called racist is literally the worst thing that can happen to a white idk have you tried calling them privileged that one really gets to them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,she didnt have to the cops took one look at them decided they were misogynists and arrested them for thought crimes thats how they got life sentences i watched them get dragged away screaming this is just like one of them broke free for a moment and tried to waddlesprint away he yelled feminism is cancer before being tased less than four steps away from the pursuing officer id hate to be the employee that had to clean up the piss puddle in any case the world doesnt have to worry about them now they are in prison where they belong honestly we need stricter laws the more of them in jail the less violent the world will be i have tons of statistics to back it up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this but unironically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what are they sand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,was expecting peggy hill
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,proof of white genocide insidetm srs at it again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can anyone link to me some good ideassome theory blog for feministsocial justice debate topics uni debater here want to make my league more aware of these issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im getting back into the scp wiki and im really happy abt the nukeitfromorbit stance they take on transphobia nowdays
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the trump dump is now pages so trump called the one black guy at his rally yesterday a thug and a paid protestor after he saw him waving at him he then had him thrown out of his rally the twist he was an actual trump supporter he was waving at him because he wanted to give him a note saying that if he wanted to win the election he had to be less racist but not that youd ever know that this happened as all major networks are streaming coverage of clintons birth certificate issues
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am become chlorine destroyer of germs and olfactory senses
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i took lifts for granted for too long now i have to go up ten floors using the stairs just wanted to whinge about stupid stuff for a bit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well all my whining about not having a crush and now some teen on ffxiv has an unrequited crush on me universe why you play like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait has trump gone to doing a birther on clinton this doesnt even make sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not being ferric chloride psh what are you ig chem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im comparing the gops tenacity to not shut up about such a nonissue as clintons emails which were put to rest long ago to the nonissue of them insisting that obama isnt an american republicans are like crabs they pinch on to one thing and never let go they understand people are simpletons and that if you repeat something enough times and with constant tenacity then people start to believe it thats marketing so while they are constantly fucking up on a daily occurrence the goto answer from the gop is yeah ok but what about hillarys emails
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feric chloride is for losers i have no idea what you just referenced
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh right lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh ig is like year chemistry its really easy compared to year as for the cambridge international examinations cie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oooh the only science im halfway competent at is compsci so ya got mehaha
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,¯ツ¯ youll do good champ
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why the hell do they want women to go to the bathroom with them like why do they want to see a woman in the mens restroom do they think bathrooms are inherently sexually charged what kind of fucking perverts are these
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont forget everyone reddit is left wing and progressive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why does it need to be more complicated than
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont get the problem here are you white then use the whites bathroom are you black then use the blacks bathroom dont make it more complicated than it needs to be the kind of bullshit that happens when you deliberately make laws that target certain groups of people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,empathy cant be sold or fucked so whites have no use for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its bad enough that schools restrict peoples usage of the bathrooms whenhow often theyre allowed to go not allowing trans students to use whichever they feel most comfortable with especially given how nasty public restrooms are is pretty dehumanizing it basically solidifies the concept that your body and personal needs arent important
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the republicans are going to be fucking pissed when the inevitable end comes and all bathrooms have to be unisex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive never understood the dilemma here are you a man use the mens room are you a woman use the womens room why does it need to be more complicated than that fixd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is that srs macro about empathy not being valued because its not a commodity havent seen it in a while but im sure it applies here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because youre not showing everyone in the bathroom you genitals you ding dong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh ok so if a trans person passes as their true gender they would have to go to that bathroom anyway like imagine a transwoman going to the mens room it would be a nightmare for her and also dangerous either way its a shit idea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jfc allies if a male wants to use the female bathroom shut the fuck up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remove this if it doesnt belong here but whats this subreddits stance on the ideal bathroom scenario bathrooms segregated but you can use the preferred one or unisex bathrooms or is no change necessary if only people could stop being assholes to other people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its almost as if the entire argument against transgender people using the correct bathroom comes down to a bunch of men who want to fondle the gentiles of ever person in the restroom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive never understood the dilemma here do you have a dick use the mens room do you have a vagina use the womens room why does it need to be more complicated than that at utc replied to ive never understood the dilemma here do you have a dick use the mens room do you have a vagina use the womens room why does it need to be more complicated than that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honest question people act like what he did was say use the bathroom of the gender you were born with but in reality didnt he just put the power back in the hands of the states to decide how they would like to set their own guidelines so if youre from a progressive state that would more than likely continue to go with obamas bill and if youre from a conservative state it has the choice to do what nc did edit not sure why this is getting downvoted to hell it was an honest question from someone who was truly trying to informed on multiple views and be open minded shouldnt that be a good thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why the hell do they want women to go to the bathroom with them so they know who to target its a hate crime they want to expose exile and harm that person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do they think bathrooms are inherently sexually charged honestly theres no other explanation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,le classically liberal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i can make it simpler i dont understand the dilenma just make every bathroom unisex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats what gets me the most so many people especially for a site that supposedly loves science and knowledge have very little to no understanding of a massive variety of issues especially social ones yet feel the need to defend their positions to the death while knowing they have done no research whatsoever like the majority of complaints people here have about social justice or feminism are debunked through a quick second google search seriously i remember one big argument i had with someone about transgender issues and he was arguing and acting insanely superior and his entire argument was debunked through literally the first link from a google search
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why better myself when i can just be a bigot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i never understood the dilemma here and i dont care to try
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i never thought about that but now that you point it out its honestly a little creepy how much schools regulate students bathroom habits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,empathy cant be sold or fucked therefore whites have no use for it or something like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was actually worse before hitting rall im sure itll be worse by the time all of the americans wake up and comment on it though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ideally wed deconstruct the idea that a gender binary exists at all and have unisex bathrooms since that probably isnt happening any time soon be consistent and let women use womens rooms and men use mens rooms which requires dealing with the basic reality that trans women are women and trans men are men i cant speak for the sub but thats going to be your general intersectional approach to the issue
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats still a bad thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres a thought experiment for you if civil rights had been left to the states would mississippi and alabama still be segregated same shit here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people act like what he did was say use the bathroom of the gender you were born with but but nothing thats what they want in fact many of the more recent bathroom bills specify that doesnt matter if you transitioned got your id changed and had srs all twenty years ago you still gotta use your assigned genders bathroom it wont be better in progressive states either aside from a handful california oregon washington maybe new york and maybe new jersey everywhere else will be shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so what happens when transpeople have to visit other states they either have to risk being caught breaking the bigoted law or being publicly outed in environments that are quite probably not transfriendly the history of america shows that allowing individual states to discriminate does not have pleasant outcomes not to mention if the republicans get a majority on the supreme court cases will go forward allowing for individual exceptions to the progressive states antibathroom discrimination laws and it will slowly become a complete clusterfuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiarkansasnationalguardandtheintegrationofcentralhighschool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,states rights has always been the rallying call for biggots im sort of done pretending its anything other than the lie they tell themselves so they can feel all small government while doing the opposite it also rings a little hollow in the context of the nc bill since that was specifically passed in response to one of their cities passing a law protecting transgender people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so if youre from a progressive state that would more than likely continue to go with obamas bill and if youre from a conservative state it has the choice to do what nc did which is why people considered it better to have trans peoples bathroom rights guaranteed at the federal level states rights would be a good thing if the choice was between having antitrans legislation at the federal level and leaving it up to the states but thats not the choice being presented here there are essentially three choices not just two federal legislation guaranteeing trans people the right to use bathrooms in accordance with their gender identity best case federal legislation requiring trans people to use bathrooms in accordance with their assigned sex worst case leaving it up to the states to decide which bathrooms trans people can use in the middle most trans people would prefer the first option and that was what obamas policy was moving towards leaving it up to the states is a net loss for trans people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in response to your edit conservatives fall back on leave it to the states when they know theyve lost the actual argument its an admission that their idea is bad and unpopular but they want to keep doing it in their states where theyll never lose an election no matter what on issues like this where the right the state wants to keep is the right to discriminate against a minority group the federal government has an obligation to step in and protect people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just want to invade every country that doesnt follow our form of government whats wrong with that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,socially liberal fiscally conservative
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah like every home has a unisex bathroom lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they love science but they arent interested in the concept of science basically they like some of the results achieved by the scientific community including social and political sciences but dont want to go through any form critical thinking or analysis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also the profound lack of empathy so many positions argued that are literally of no consequence to the person arguing but mean so much to the people having problems
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this gets me as well many of the debates you see in the topranked comments were settled decades ago in academia and many of reddits bright ideas would be laughed out of the room by people who have spent any length of time studying the topic seeing how casually some of these dumbfucks dismiss literally all of academia and the mainstream news is scary because they are literally trying to go back to a time when the word of the king was the ultimate truth and anybody who disagreed could be dismissed andor killed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tolerance is a rightwing projection narrative fool kombatbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its mostly because the current school model is based off the factory schools for children of workers which served the dual purpose of childcare and preparing future workers with a basic education who were already familiar with the routine so since you couldnt freely go to the toilet at work you cant freely go to the toilet at school
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my school gave you five passes a semester to use the restroom which means you can leave class five times a semester to go to the restroom and get back but that is still only if the teacher consents fun times
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,teachers need to know where students are at all times if students were able to leave whenever they wanted to go to the bathroom the teacher would have absolutely no idea where the students are and if god forbid a fire or lockdown happens that would be really really bad imagine going to pick your kid up from school and asking the teacher where your kid is and the teacher just shrugs you would be pretty pissed how an entire school lost your kid also though yes its also kinda a trust thing too you dont want a student using the bathroom to leave school or hide from class personally i just let students go when they want to they just have to let me know because i need to know where they are how ever some teachers do abuse this for some unknown reason
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you get a bathroom he gets a bathroom they get a bathroom everyone gets a bathroom we should just make them unisex already tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,destroying gender will be a bit problematic because many people currently identify with some or all of their gender but if gender were to just go away i know i certainly wouldnt miss it im by and large an individualist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what about intersex people that are born sometimes with a combination of both genitals well obviously they will be treated like freaks and herded off to the nearest concentration camp by the there are only two genders people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i personally think theres a simple solution but its do you look like a girl use the womens toilet look like a man use the mens toilet look like neither use whichever you want i wont know what you are doing in your stall and i honestly dont care
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just wanted to add httpwwwmassgovcourtscaselegalreslawliblawsbysubjabouttransgenderhtml to the list of good states it protects the right of all people – including transgender people – to use sexsegregated facilities that are most consistent with their sincerely held gender identity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a fair number of citiescounties have protections too like pa as a whole kinda sucks doesnt even have protection for sexual orientation but in pittsburgh or philly youre good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you for answering this makes sense i guess ive always been for giving states the power to govern themselves but i guess theres not a very good track record when it comes to laws based on discrimination
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it also rings a little hollow in the context of the nc bill since that was specifically passed in response to one of their cities passing a law protecting transgender people fucking this conservatives only want small government when it works in their favor its a marketing slogan not a principle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is that what those ushaped toilet seats are for lots of womens rooms have them too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,communism killed of millions what african people millions dying from starvation and preventable diseases every year thats their own fault for hating america and not having enough freedom they just need less government the freer the market the freer the people also they should stop that being brown thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for when you believe economic and social policy have absolutely no relation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there are folks in that thread saying how mens and womens restrooms have equipment specifically tailored for the corresponding sex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they say they love science but they really just like to look at sciences butt when it walks by
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they love science but they arent interested in the concept of science science is lasers jetpacks and mclass planets science requires you to admit that youre out of your depth and that you may be wrong about things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for leaving the post up long enough to block the kiddo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,graders fucking in the bathroom wait what the fuck are you sure it wasnt a different grade
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at my high school someone shit in the boys bathroom in the fucking sink this happened last year
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also in middle school graders got caught fucking in the bathroom ah i remember that seventh grade at my school they werent the only kids caught actually but they were the only ones who got in trouble because they were both girls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,see this is what im talking about like i get it when its a safety issue and teachers have to know kids whereabouts but stuff like this is just ridiculous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i didnt suggest destroying gender just deconstructing the forced binary narrative
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually we have special doctors that decide whether they are better suited to have a vagina or a penis you know when theyre still babies and dont use any bathroom yet but also dont know what sex is this is for giving the psychologists more jobs thus the circle of life is completed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if people cant agree on which one you look like the problem with such a measure is that its inherently subjective and its flaws have already been demonstrated the antitrans crowd has tried to do vigilante bathroom policing and ended up blocking cis women from using the bathroom because they didnt look feminine enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you look like x aka do you pass is a rigidly and violently enforced social norm that no one at least in this sub should validate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you honestly dont care yet you deliberately show up here and share your unqualified opinion on it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,states rights is a concept that was coined by lost causers who never got over losing the fight on slavery it was the argument used in school segregation it is literally a white supremacists argument but placed underneath the klan hood of southern strategy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean you can be for states rights in general but it doesnt really work for civil rights by saying leave it to the states you are saying that states should be able to discriminate if they want to it makes sense that if you are against discrimination for ethical reasons then you should against discrimination in all of the us it makes no sense to be against discrimination but be fine with certain states discriminating
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and as we were talking about this trump comes out as antimarijuana maybe states rights only applies to states that vote the right way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think thats just to make manufacturing simple its easier to just make one part than two how many toilets do you need for you new building ok order you dont have to order and install correctly u shaped seats and wrap around seats it reduces skus for the manufacturer and wholesaler and retailer thats just my guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,communism fails in every country because the us installs a dictator first
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my queer bar in town has two restrooms the door of one has two toilets painted on it and the door on the other one has a toilet and a urinal painted on it you can use whichever bathroom you please its not difficult the mens floor i currently live on at my university doesnt even have a urinal and somehow we have all survived
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean using a urinal is slightly more annoying but thats what i have a shewee for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i quoted that ch comic the other day too is this going to become a regular thing ugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah it was like years ago but i distinctly remember morning announcement happening
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how many people do you think started doing that sort of thing just to emulate that one south park episode
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i only remember hearing about one instance of it and they got suspended or expelled
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah sorry if it felt like i was putting words into your mouth my views are my own and nothing more and yes i would definitely be satisfied with getting rid of the expectation of conformity to the gender norms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sweet jesus i forgot about those horrible horrible people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ha yep i almost came back and edited that in states rights are important unless we need an excuse to fill private prisons and arrest lots of brown people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like to be fair urinals save a lot of water and that is important but i hardly think that bathroom equipment is a hill to die on though on the other hand there was that time that zizek explained ideology through toilet design so idunno
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its pretty funny that the kind of content creators that reddit loves are more aware about this than redditors themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wasnt even giving reasons for bathrooms to be segregated i was just telling something that happened at my school
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unisex toilets that might be better but theres also a lot of people who would not be comfortable with it theres no perfect solution this has been the garbage answer for any white moderate who is faced with the dilemma of having to give up normalizing oppression yeah but if we free the slaves then that means they are on equal footing as poor whites and too many people would not be comfortable with it sorry but there is no perfect solution the solution is simple fuck the oppressors feelings how a person feels about no longer stepping on someone elses neck is irrelevant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deconstructing the way society especially white western society views gender and enforces gender norms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,legalization of marijuana lolin leftleaning states yeah wow fantastic unless you think medical marijuana is counted in that bullshit and red states where medical marijuana is legal the state legislature has passed laws to curtail dispensaries monitor dispensary customers crack down harder on marijuana possessiongood deflect though i especially like the whole oh i dont believe southern strategy exists bit just a tip for the future you might sound less like a bad faith participant if you werent a joe rogan fan or deflecting milo being a pedophile or doing a im just asking questions routine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,guess that reddit says they love those content creators but they really just like to look etc heck they created an entire movement of hypermisogyny based on symbolism from a movie written by two trans women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wasnt even discussing segration i was replying to a comment about how somebody said how they limit bathroom visits in schools was bad i totally think people should be able to shit wherever the hell they want unisex bathrooms would make mroe sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh yes sorry i forgot what the reply was under and assumed it was over the title of the post bathroom visits in my school arent restricted at all unless its someone who is known for not coming back or just wondering around for a long time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in middle school we had to sign a sheet that got submitted to upper administration at the end of the week they would keep tallies of visits this only went on for about or months though it became too much work for them in high school most teachers either had a policy to not let you go or bathroom passes the most bathroom passes i got from a teacher was a year each semester they did not roll over the ones who didnt let you go said you had time between classes even though you only had minutes between classes when it could take to to get from one side of the school to the other
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh wow we have a sign in thing in front of the bathroom to keep the graffiti downhave suspects in case theres poop again but i dont think it works especially because theres usually not someone making you sign in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,makes sense the last thing i would do is sign up for poop monitor duty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in response to japan banning drinking and emplacing a curfew on us military after murder of a local woman when mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre not sending you ironic when japan can say the same thing at utc smileyfrown replied to when mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre not sending you theyre not sending you theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good people ironic when japan can say the same thing httpiimgurcommqwiipapng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,um
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we should start a wiki for people who dont understand what haram means its just as shitty as people misusing triggered or attack helicopter shit and blatantly islamaphobic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im gonna start saying sexual euphoria and this is haram during sex now pretty excited at utc negbreg replied to im gonna start saying sexual euphoria and this is haram during sex now pretty excited
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre so right my buddy feminists never ever talk about toxic masculinity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly wont anyone ever think about the men edit at least theres some nonpoop getting upvoted in there this ones at rn why do these discussions always wind up going in this direction weve stopped empathizing and started turning issues into a moral pissing contest where one side cannot possibly be facing something that the other isnt already experiencing what i mean to say is when you talk to someone about allowing syrian refugees into america the response from someone who doenst support it typically is along the lines of why would we let in refugees when were not even capable of taking care of our own veterans yes veterans need better care but youve just hijacked the point of the discussion in order to put yourself on the moral high ground yes men do face implicit bias as well but dont hijack the moral high ground and try to outpity someone have some empathy and ask important questions like how can i stop doing this how can i tell if i have implicit biases if you can solve your own problems you can start helping others do the same dont rationalize away your own problems by throwing a pity party
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but how dare feminists use the term toxic masculinity amirite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,interpreted as lemme just mansplain this to yall
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,re implicit bias as it relates to feminism the only thing that bothers me about the whole implicit bias thing is that people dont concede it affects men as well men are seen as more likely to be violent aggressive etc and this has various negative effects in reply to zazzlekdazzle on httpkirwaninstituteosueduresearchunderstandingimplicitbias the best way i can explain it is from an anecdote from my own experience i am a scientist and as a result consider myself to really be someone who thinks of things carefully weighing all the evidence i would never have thought i had much if any implicit bias about anything i am a geneticist and originally worked on modelsystem fly genetics like many do later in my career i switched fields to work on an organism that causes a disease that exists mostly in the developing world suddenly my colleagues went from being white to being at least black and latino because they were africans and south americans though many of them had positions at american and european universities when i started meeting them and hearing about their work i found myself feeling a bit surprised that their research was as rigorous and innovative as that of the white dudes in my fly world i had not expected them to be so dedicated to good science and building good research plans i had never realized it but i never really question why the colleagues i had worked with were always white i think in some way i had the idea that people of color just didnt have it i cant really even say what this it was but probably some sort of mixture of natural talent good work ethic and dedication to something abstract like science i hate to think of treating my black and latino students differently during this time without even noticing it at the very least just not making that much of an investment in them because i assumed they just wouldnt make the cut not to mention having a different reaction from the beginning seeing an email or resume from a laquita jackson or a carlos mendezherrera as opposed to a madison wilson or a jeremy adams if while a fly biologist someone brought the idea up to me that i was judging people based on their race i would have said they were insane i am very liberal in my politics and consider myself to be highly aware of the social issues of race not to mention being a hyperrational or so i thought scientist as mentioned above in fact i bet i would have said that if a black student ever showed any real interest they would get all sorts of special treatment and be promoted beyond their abilities i would never have thought that maybe the reason those students didnt stay on in the field was because they didnt feel welcome and could sense that people didnt believe in them or had patronizingly low expectations maybe they never even got in the door in the first place because of this issue it was a real wakeup call these are the same things happen with women in all sorts of circumstances in my own field just the type of issue i am illustrating here with my anecdote has been supported with actual research an article in pnas illustrated the issue very well although this article speaks only to a specific type of case hiring a recent college graduate for a gateway position in science i do think it has broader implications to other circumstances and fields and it certainly speaks to the idea of how one decision can have a cascading effect on someones life or career reading the article filled me with aha moments about my own experiences also with implicit bias against women from both sides although pitched for humor i think the sketch of is a good illustration of how this issue can affect women edit i should also add that i am actually married to a latino scientist and i am sure i would have pointed to that in my defense of having any bias at utc wrote the only thing that bothers me about the whole implicit bias thing is that people dont concede it affects men as well men are seen as more likely to be violent aggressive etc and this has various negative effects men being more likely to get longer jail sentences for the same crime violence against men not being taken seriously boys in school getting suspended more etc even if people concede this they often say its justified or its not a big deal i guess this is part of a larger issue that i think that unlike race gender issues are more complicated than one side being privileged and the other oppressed its more twosided even if on net women have it worse but people talk about it that way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what do you mean all masculinity is toxic waaah misandry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey i am new to this stuff can you explain how what you are saying is a response to that post i know i am ignorant but i really dont understand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lucky for you theres an argument about the horrible oppressive sexism of the word mansplaining a few comments down from the quoted one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i got into that with three other people in that exact same thread i mean fucks sake this is grammatical nuance that a ten year old should understand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,grammar and communication is for humanities plebs i a logical and rational stemsir dont need to understand adjectives to become euphoric
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you probably wanna take it to if you have more questions but in brief toxic masculinity consists of culturalsocial restrictions that limit the only culturally acceptable masculinity men can perform to one that is harmful to themselves the violent aggressive unemotional nonnurturing manliness that the quote is complaining about if you see men performing masculinity in another way whether its deeply caring about somethingsomeone and visibly displaying it crying or showing other emotions not wanting sex for whatever reason being interested in the arts asking for help wanting a career in nursing or childcare and being derided for any of that as girly or sissy or not a real man thats toxic masculinity at work e my post relates to that post because feminism definitely acknowledges and talks about the effects of the patriarchy on men which is what maintainscreates the construct and the cultural bias
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes thank you for that i was circlejerking your explanation of toxic masculinity is spot on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy moly i hadnt actually looked at the source thread until now when i saw the title i assumed the worst then the top toplevelcomment is a legit issue and the second top toplevelcomment is goldredditsays material not sure how that happened in asscredit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in this moment i am euphoric not because of any phony social sciences but because i am enlightened by my stem intelligence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay this totally makes sense thank you i will take future questions to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and redditors always react to the phrase as if it means masculinity in all forms is toxic because men are bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know i was complaining about reddit complaining about mansplaining
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah that thread was surprisingly good in general not perfect but then its reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,btw i forgot to add that toxic masculinity is often internalized too so if a man stops himself from doing something along those lines that he wants to do before he ever does it or feels guilt or shame for doing it even if no one else gives him grief for it thats also part of the effects
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,then usually when you try to explain it to them if youre feeling patient enough to try for the time they double down and then run away because they dont want to have their preconceptions about ebil feminism challenged
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you for adding this because i think i have this problem i will often stop myself from crying even when i am alone out of a sense of guilt something i definitely need to work on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i came here after seeing that thread knowing there would be some wellselected bigotry nuggets for me to feast on that thread is a cesspool in response to feminism being about equality one of the top comments will update as i can
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were at the point where if i hear someone was raped i immediately want to know was it a real rape or a new age rape i have no words at least people have upvoted this garbage statement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins as disappointing as it is its certainly not a surprise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that is not racism that is generalization yeah okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why no i cant think of any reason why other racial groups might not have had the same social opportunities in the west
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can quote whatever you want your argument is fundamentally flawed from the beginning no evidence can save you translation youre wrong because i say so no matter what the facts say
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wanted to let yall know i contacted the mods and received permission to violate the nothingyoureinvolvedin rule because the comment was so highly upvoted seriously read through the thread so much shit like damn if i may start us off ahem analogies are liberal bullshit and stereotype threat is an anecdote science edit also have you noticed that people who use the phrase victim ideology are the same ones victimizing others what a wacky coincidence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,until about all of the important people in western society were white in reply to captainlavender on absolutely these are just a few off the top of my head when you speak in class your comments may be attached to your race or assumed to speak for a large portion of your race learning about history science etc is basically learning about what white people were doing while they were busy barring your ancestors from opportunities for achievement dealing with stereotype threat a welldocumented phenomenon in which priming people to identify with a demographic that is stereotypically bad at something will make them worse at that thing for example when asian women are asked their race before being given a math test they do slightly but significantly better when they are asked their sex before the test they likewise do significantly worse negative stereotypes activate anxieties which make it harder to excel this isnt about race but stem researchers most of whom were also professors offered the same research candidate identical resume less money and volunteered less help if the name at the top was female so thats a pretty wellestablished bias i would imagine that if any similar studies are done regarding race i havent looked it up lately the results are probably analogous salience bias white students are more likely to notice a black student than another white student tis means black students will always feel conspicuous on predominantlywhite campuses i can absolutely keep going at utc dukeofcrydee wrote when you speak in class your comments may be attached to your race or assumed to speak for a large portion of your race when speaking about the industrial revolution or calculus there is no affect on anything racial but that assumption exists for white people speaking about race issues learning about history science etc is basically learning about what white people were doing while they were busy barring your ancestors from opportunities for achievement well up until about all of the important people in western society were white im jewish you dont see me being offended about holocaust discussion or the fact that we learn about the protestant reformation and christianity in europe these things are integral to understanding western society and culture if you want to learn about black history then you should focus on african societies because it seems like youd prefer to identify with that culture instead of western liberalism you can start httpswwwwikiwandcomenwritingsystemsofafrica dealing with stereotype threat a welldocumented phenomenon in which priming people to identify with a demographic that is stereotypically bad at something will make them worse at that thing for example when asian women are asked their race before being given a math test they do slightly but significantly better when they are asked their sex before the test they likewise do significantly worse negative stereotypes activate anxieties which make it harder to excel what the hell does that have to do with anything this is a related anecdote at best how do you encounter that daytoday this isnt about race but stem researchers most of whom were also professors offered the same research candidate identical resume less money and volunteered less help if the name at the top was female so thats a pretty wellestablished bias i would imagine that if any similar studies are done regarding race i havent looked it up lately the results are probably analogous you are guessing here its ironic you mention stem when presenting your unscientific argument this means nothing in regards to race salience bias white students are more likely to notice a black student than another white student tis means black students will always feel conspicuous on predominantlywhite campuses people notice me because im different im sure they also notice punks girls with blue hair and orthodox jews youre not special wheres there people dont let me into parties because im black or the im not allowed to register for classes because im black or the people shout ngger at me when i walk by how do you expect to be taken seriously when this is how you define racism what else fits in your definition of racism httpiimgurcomupjuimbpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what makes this so funny is that they used which is like years before slavery was abolished in the us maybe slavery has something to do with it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,errr well actually i didnt realize that you were involved with the thread when i said that lol i was just thinking of the karma rule its ok we will leave it this time i just dont want people to have the wrong impression about when we may or may not bend the rules
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh come now this is reddit you know that acknowledging race exists makes you the real racist unless youre praising white peoplethats just logic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who said that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,goddesses
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nods
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what alternate dimension are these people from and how do i get there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,comments like this make me think the op was sitting around counting bitterly another black actor thats the second one this month its too many sorry black people have jobs in hollywood sometimes i dont know what to even say edit i didnt change anything above but since i was being bothered by srssucks usersreaders i have to help them with some reading comprehension they are confused why i am speaking about black people instead of lgbtq this is because of a little something called context if you look at our bot only just a few comments below youll see the context for the shitty linked comment was they also think half the nation is black when its only so there you have it kiddos i hope youve all learned something about context today
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder what this average american looks like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because two years in a row where zero pocs were nominated for any oscar whatsoever is definitely hollywood overrepresenting pocs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because theyre so overrepresented in media its actually true for being such a small percentage of the whole theyre actually over represented in hollywood and music in reply to networklackey on they also think half the nation is black when its only at utc superquickexpressway wrote because theyre so overrepresented in media
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit that image is perfect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,petition to add this image as smiley
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it should be a smiley
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no human is illegal fight the class war not the race war
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so youre telling me that people fleeing for their lives and living in miserable conditions might not display exemplary behavior yeah theyre basically animals then its totally right to say that based on a youtube video with little or no context which could easily be fake its also totally right to say that even if the youtube video has no facts distorted because harboring prejudice towards an entire group of millions of people based on the actions of a few is entirely justified
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,human rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can we send redditors somewhere whatever happened to that reddit island idea it sounds a little better every day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,obligatory like the whites followed the rules and showed gratitude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre like animals send them back if they cant follow the rules of your country and show some gratitude fuck you trump trash they are people at utc replied to theyre like animals send them back if they cant follow the rules of your country and show some gratitude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,while a safe space does mean excluding people who hostile to others it isnt necessarily a heavily censored space either i get that we want to call thedonald on their hypocrisy but cant we do that without dragging safe spaces even further through the mud
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes send all the white people back to europe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but throwing illegal in white peoples faces helps deal with the scars of colonization wat do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not all men though s uns considering crash we should deport white males save our economy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you see even before the crisis they viewed arabs as subhuman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when reddit sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre bringing pedophilia theyre bringing fascism theyre bringing racism some of them i assume are good people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the sooner they go the better it will be for decent people trying to live their lives in peace
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites arent human obviously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not the only reason we should start deporting white males
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean if you look at those mass shootings they make a pretty strong case against us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites arent human obviously there maybe now youll understand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,srs is a satire subreddit that makes light of racism and sexism by turning the tables and speaking of cis heterosexual white men in a fashion similar to what the white supremacistsmrasconservatives spout to disadvantaged groups this is done to highlight their doublestandard and raise awareness of abuse white males are a disease srs is the cure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre one of the good ones i dont even think of you as white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or both world wars
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbh if you looked at mass shootings the white pretense should drop and it should be just men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait we arent serious about wanting white genocide it seemed like such a sound plan though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white people lie steal colonize sell drugs etc and i think we should deport them back to europe but hey i dont hate white people i have a couple of white friends
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean its a great plan but we need to spermjack them first use your head
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbh whiteness is something that should be destroyed i guess if we could just get rid of the whiteness in white people they could stay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone didnt attend sjw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,although it never gets old that this is an irrational mra fear im still concerned about the idea that we will want to rebreed the rodditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think white people would be fine as long as they completely and utterly got rid of everything that makes them white and assimilated into our culture they can stay as long as they become exactly as we are were trying to promote diversity here but were not trying to lose our culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,race is a spook
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do we start slaughtering white people now or next tuesday
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone should just become a communist and well be raceless proletariat who celebrate and enjoy the good qualities of all peoples culture thats my solution anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,then we can all have communal vegan or labgrown synthetic barbecues in space
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fully automated barbeques
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fully automated grills i suppose because its fully automated luxury space communism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we could always start with socialism and wean people off of capitalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,posts in and gaming subreddits must be one of those reddit liberals that live in a postsexist society
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yay time to get brigaded over a fucking joke d signs that you lack any critical thought and will desperately seek validation by parroting demonstrably false reddit narratives we dont give a single fuck about your fake internet points dumbass if anything id upboat you to keep your shit at the top but i simply do not give a shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,time to get brigaded over a fucking joke so all that comes out of your mouth is careless drivel
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he whines about being brigaded but his comment went from to and is still climbing yes please tell me more how srs brigades
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,she didnt cheat she is a woman so she only actually had to do of the course because equality at utc soapgoat replied to she didnt cheat she is a woman so she only actually had to do of the course because equality httpiimgurcomviioblrpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of those people who think smoking weed and tugging it to nonwhite women once in a while makes you leftwing i think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont touch the poop tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol a bunch them losing their shit over srs throughout that thread my fave is the ableist concern troll saying were all gonna die of heart attacks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now sitting at
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,make a joke about white boys being privileged all of the sudden redditors get reall upset and come out of the woodwork to shoot it down
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well you see his victim complex has to form a protective shell of a narrative of a hostile world of feminazis gheys and brown people in order to avoid the dreadful epiphany that maybe he himself is the problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,doesnt even need to be said couldnt possibly care less about cracker jacks utterly meaningless score
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hmmmmmm taking some time off from shitposting on the same bad vidya sub thanks for sharing this moment where you learned something though wondering who you thought fucking cared enough that you needed to share
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no is it painful to remember that your ancestors were enslaving human beings and working them like livestock while using cracking whips as enforcement you poor child im so sorry to have offended you fuck off cracker
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,racial insult white ppl got such thin skin bye dickwipe bobityben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was curious decided to search for penis wipes read the product description see photos of the founders tell me that isnt the most white dudebro thing youve ever seen what is so dude about them anyway it seems like luxury wipes why would they only market them to men lol my this was a fun couple of minutes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well this sucks everytime i turn around these days people i thought were kind of funny on yt are turning into alt reich asshats
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you either die young or live long enough to see yourself become the villain rip jontron
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,talk like a nazi get called a nazi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shoutout to that time jontron tried to talk to neil cicierega and neil told him to fuck off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,didnt jontron do a livestream with fucking sargon of akkad you cant really have a good argument for him not being a neonazi fuckstick after that and yeah people are entitled to their views but when youre a youtube celebrity with a lot of youngish fans you should be responsble about the things you promote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can someone this whole jontron thing why are people calling him alt right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people are genuinely calling jontron a facistnazietc for expressing his views this is extremely unfair framing people arent entitled to their views remaining unchallenged hes not being called names because he expressed his views hes being called names because what those views are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey that bird is a waterfowl with webbed feet and a broad bill and quacks but it told me it rejects identity politics so can we please stop throwing the word duck around
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,walks like a nazi talks like a nazi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to everyone who like me is really disappointed that a youtuber we used to like turned out to be a neonazi say it together with me loud and clear so that we dont forget you dont have to be a good person to be charismatic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my first thought is who the hell is jontron then his consistent rejection of identity politics on sargons stream is evidence of that oh good i dont need to know who this is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well duh if you express your views and your views are nazism is good people will call you a nazi how are these people surprised at this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god damnit i liked jontron i didnt know he was a piece of shit now im in a bad mood
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i once worried that game grumps wouldnt be as good when jontron left lmao those were more innocent times no but seriously i have an old gg shirt that needs burning
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im so glad he left game grumps even when he was on it and i didnt know about his shitty opinions i thought there was something off about some of the stuff he said i really like game grumps now and danny for me is the only true not so grump i think he has great chemistry with arin is really funny by himself and i really like him for other personal reasons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well its not coming from nowhere people are genuinely calling jontron a facistnazietc for expressing his views in reply to gabidalbygarlmarx on rip rjontron ill always remember this place before it became lol literally shaking haha literally hitler amirite jons so based shitlords unite xd at utc dodorevenge wrote well its not coming from nowhere people are genuinely calling jontron a facistnazietc for expressing his views those people deserve to be mocked
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the rgamegrumps discussion about this is surprisingly not terrible i suppose its kind of sad though that i expect every video game related fanbase to be awful by default
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre better off just assuming that your favorite youtube person is reactionary by default until youre proven otherwise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,roosterteeth is still safe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if the founding fathers were alive today they would have killed themselves about miscegenation long before they heard anyones political points
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the founding fathers would just hate it if they saw people exercising the rights that they enshrined
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought it was die a hero
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously why does he get to talk about stuff and i dont get to talk about stuff
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please supply links
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,boom roasted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the videos where he makes fun of reduculous bs and bootlegs were funny but dont agree with any of his politics and think he should probably stop trying to thrust himself into the political opinion but now i guess the damage is done might be an ok one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he gave an interview to breitbart alt right white supremacist online magazine and recently appeared on a podcast with alt right individuals where he supported nazi conspiracy theories
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people arent entitled to their views remaining unchallenged hes not being called names because he expressed his views hes being called names because what those views are i want this put on a billboard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you dont have to be a good person to be charismatic this is an extremely good thing to keep in mind i think lately with this highly politicized climate a lot of people are showing their true colours and when those true colours include things like fuck lgbt people women dont deserve access to abortion and wont they do something about all the scary brown people remember the value in knowing their true feelings because now you can remove yourself from the situation and not support them even if it sucks in the moment to realize an old fave is a piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man begins career screaming at video games and then later evolves to also scream about movies there all you need to know trust me i used to be a fan of his work too bad hes a piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,eh russians give a pretty good run for their money also my sister lived in italy for a year and she said theyre super racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can still like his contentliking someone for what they do and liking someone for who they are are two different things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i havent watched gg since jon leftis it better now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,harshlycritical seems cool when it comes to gaming channels
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lets not forget jimquisition
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rhett and link are the only good youtubers left
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah that sub is actually pretty okay for the most part theyve always called out jon on his bullshit like when he did that interview with fucking breitbart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats what happens when they start a hate movement because a girl said something mean about their video games who are gamergaters only allies mras puas reactionaries transphobes neonazisall people who also hate women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please dont become a nazi erik
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kpopp noooooooo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fantano is cool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dunno burnie only thinks there are senses the mans basically anti science at this point s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also holy shit planes and cars and fast food and giant massive cities and non white people walking around like its okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jesus christ that really sucks i really liked jontron
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,here is a summary of what he said in the livestream thats really fucked up even though i lost respect for him doing an interview with breitbart i thought he was a useful idiot for their cause to hear that he listens to molyneux believes media no longer report truth after doing an interview with fucking breitbart for gods sake and supports marine le pen is so disappointing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its kind of ironic that hes supporting those kind of people considering hes the son of iranian immigrants who came to the us in the
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh what the fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id still rather not give money to a nazi tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah as i said the new guy danny infinitely more funny and charming for me than jon ever was and i like their new side shows as well their humor can get pretty lewd very fast because thats just dannys personality so if youre ok with that its very good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love his playthru therpgminx aka mangaminx is also pretty enjoyable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,daddy nl is best youtuber
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hbomberguy is a channel that used to do funny takedowns of neonazi youtubers and has now moved on to doing funny interesting games analysis i like him actually the whole youtube genre of british person goes way too in depth analyzing a video game seems to be full of prosocial justice people best genre on youtube if you ask me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just found him a few months ago hes pretty good only youtuber with a full silent hill playthrough i could find that wasnt annoying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank god for jim fucking sterling son
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he told sjws to drink bleach on a video for theamazingatheist no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fantano is cool i have bad news for you

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,egg daddy will never betray us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anthony noooooooooooooooo he just he seems like one of us he seemed like hes very problack rights prowomens rights progay rights protrans rights and so on wtf was he doing on a sargon of akkad livestream
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bbut its le joak guiz youtubers when confronting their bullshit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean yeah he gave mbdtf a not cool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he said the womens march was just a bunch of whiners
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,which one the one where he hung himself or the one where he took pills
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gg is definitely one of the big youtube comedy shows that i can watch without feeling guilty their humor is super lewd and generally crass but they generally stay away from controversial topics and tend to approach them from a serious perspective when they do discuss them they do have some sorta offensive jokes but nothing completely awful and its generally clear that they dont have an agenda behind it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well theres also the part where hes chums with a lot of online neo nazi dweebs but yeah giving mbdtf a was pretty shitty too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ohh rich why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously thats makes me really sad since i love redlettermedia even if i didnt always agree with them c where did he say this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the one where he hung himself for de funnies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats true but he dissed ye seriously it sucks when you find out youtubers you like are actually kinda pieces of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just who he is unfortunately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he said it on the prerec stream on the or whichever one they played that shitty car game and he said it again at the beginning of the stream last night when some people him in the chat gave him shit for it jack pushed back but hes never going to really challenge richs fucked up opinions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh because the pill one i think was an earlier one so i didnt think much of the hanging one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,true but i think it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not neonazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rule x
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lets see how they respond uspez is a cuck are these the people you want to associate with spez
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit indelibly known to the media as that pedo site that supports trump can only be good for business surely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this explanation is not convincing its not even really an explanation you couldve said that about all of trumps answers

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we did work with the rthedonald mod team to ensure this ama ran smoothly for everyone involved the ama was a success yeah brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a promotional thing the admins couldnt turn down the chance to get an ama from a presidential candidate on their website
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly he does hes had every opportunity to ban that sub but doesnt either he agrees with them or just doesnt care either way uspez you are clearly fine with your site being home to pedophiles rapists bigots racists homophobes terrorists and all manner of vile lowlife scum is this the legacy you want to leave behind is this what you wanted this site to be the content you allow to fester on reddit is a direct reflection of its creator and leader you when is enough gonna be enough when are you going to stand up and take a stand against this shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah come on thats not true its also known as that site that fucked up the boston bomber thing but was so overconfident it drove that dude to suicide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,their simply trying to corner the pedophile nazi demographic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder if they ever worked with the rhillaryclinton mods because that place gets brigaded like hell eveytime meanwhile rtheadolph brigades and gets no punishment whatsoever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,monster high fancommunity looking good fam im the only member who has posted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in his defense the media backlash of banning that sub would be unprecedented especially since all of the conspiracy theorists are trump supporters and after what happened with sanders and claimed voter fraud this would be a pretty big thing i hate that sub sooooo much its filled with total morons but if reddit even touches it theyre shooting themselves in the foot arm and leg they should have addressed this ages ago and now theyre immobilized
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cant blame him after the fph debacle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so now theyre in competition with wonderful
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont like clinton but the amount of harassment her supporters receive is utterly absurd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this shit level comment has been justly removed but i would like to add a ben in honor of the fact that this person attempted to make a serious smug ass comment with the username weedblazer it literally made me lol rip mister weedblazer staybenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it could be worse i run the introvert community and it like died rip
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cant u tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,could you imagine what a hillary ama would look like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,doncha just miss having a community centered around insulting and bullying people for their weight while maintaining the razorthin veneer of caring for the health of people you dehumanized and ridiculed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember when they promised to fuck off to voat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the real winners of the world dont make or take opportunities to succeed they dont exercise exchanging good ideas or creativity or civility or any of the beautiful things in life that we only have a finite amount of time to enjoy the real winners gather on the internet to jerk each other off over hate oh reddit maybe there is still hope
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its times like this i wish reddit would burn to the ground
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a troll hopefully with the username lanigracoonridge was upvoted with a comment that was clearly meant to be hateful i hate reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its times like this i wish rfatpeoplehate was still around at utc replied to its times like this i wish rfatpeoplehate was still around
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was one of the people who did just that there is an fph on that site but voat is mostly a cesspool of islamophobia these days sub count of vfph is nowhere near the original subreddits looking back on it i was a bit of a moron water under the bridge now but i do know how they behave which is nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the mods comment on the post wasnt too bad either ffs people whats wrong with you hating on a overweight person like hes some kind of animal or monster get along please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,weirdly enough i have him at votes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought this or rthebluepill were it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt that putting too much effort into it we dont really need to do much to freak them out already
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but make it all were just giving men a hard time so they learn to be better its really just caring about good behaviours
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre one of the good ones that grew out of being a toxic shit rather than doubling down on hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you forgot ragainstmensrights its right there in the name sarcasm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh yeah rmenslib fucks with those people too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,given that one of the original power rangers was gay and ostrasized and bullied by the rest of the production crew because of it this seems particularly ironicegregious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,artificial diversity i want to pretend that everyone around me is just like me and i hate when the media i consume forces me to consider otherwise i love bros who treat media all media like it has to be their safe space
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but remember its those lefty spooky sjws who are perpetually offended and outraged s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one really gives a shit about who you fuck i agree does anyone else think we should make lgbt characters the default then i mean no one caaaaaares and all funny how the people who cry about others getting some kind of representation never had to worry about the lack of representation for themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,plays a thousand games starring white mcstraightdude plays a game that includes a gay person raaarrgh i dont care about your sexualityyy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one really gives a shit and the winner in most often repeated bullshit of all time category is i dont care i guess this is what feels like not giving a fuck to people who are resentful of others so often it doesnt feel like an emotion to them anymore just an absence of emotion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one gives a shit except the nerds who complain every time theres an lgbt character in anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if people didnt care about who we fucked then this wouldnt be a conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one really gives a fuck about who you fuck in a thread about russia being homophobic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why does every single movievideo gameanything have to include some straight character its artificial diversity if you ask me no one really gives a shit about who you fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember it only counts as pandering if it isnt to straight white dudes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one really gives a shit about who you fuck yet here you are complaining about who people fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont care cant you salad juices see how much i dont care please pay attention to my apathy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,diversity isnt pandering diversity is realistic having mostly straightwhitecismale select as appropriate characters is pandering
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the correct word is tokenism its the lefts version of racismsexism no words
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i havent seen the movie in question but does it take the time to explore any other characters sexualitypersonal life that to me would be the difference between pandering and character development
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why does every single movievideo gameanything have to include some cishet character its artificial diversity if you ask me no one really gives a shit about who you fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know whats artificial diversity having a white cis male action hero who saves the world south and southeast asia alone has a larger population than all other nations combined why isnt asian the default why all this pandering
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you meaninternalized homophobia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you think its anywhere near every single movievideo gameanything you are suffering from some extreme confirmation bias i mean were there any films in theatres last week with an lgbt character besides beauty and the beast even that barely counts no one really gives a shit about who you fuck he says while demonstrating that he absolutely gives a shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why does every single anything have to include some cishet character
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why does every single movievideo gameanything have to include some lgbt character its artificial diversity if you ask me no one really gives a shit about who you fuck at utc squiznard replied to why does every single movievideo gameanything have to include some lgbt character its artificial diversity if you ask me no one really gives a shit about who you fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if no one gives a shit who you fuck then why are they getting pissy about lgbt characters by their own logic it shouldnt matter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people who say this really do give a shit about you being gay and want you back in the closet they can take their attitude and shove it up their arse also horizon zero dawn is a great game some of these idiots will never play because its got a woman as a protagonist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,america has a president who thinks the entire country should be his safe space
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive always said that id like to see aggressive reparations how great would it be to see showsfilmsetc only featuring queer people or only featuring poc i think moonlight is the only film i can think of in recent times where i struggle to think of a white face in the cast which is cool actually not only does it give me an insight as to how poc feel when watching most mainstream fodder i think its really great progress slightly rambling comment but yeah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly also your flair made me out loud laugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not a gamer find them a bit boring what is the game that the piece of living arsegravy is referencing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you know that tracer being a lesbian is literally straight genocide s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats different straight white guys are the default anything else is politically correct pandering to the es jay dubyas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why is no one validating my apathy dont you even care how much i dont care
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,salad juices this is my new favorite sjw replacement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait is it then pandering if it takes that time or if it doesnt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but its the stupid sjws who demand safe spaces their the real problem i fucking hate this website
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people like stories that are relatable one thing that is often relatable is loverelated drama love interests play a big role in media and always have that is inherently going to go one way or the other whats wrong with making it a little bit more even
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ikr i mean they cared enough to make the post even i hate reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yup it was the only all black cast film to win the best picture films with a south asian lead character are almost non existent in the west i can only think of in the last years lion this past year slumdog millionaire almost years ago and bend it like beckham back in and all three of those are british produced hollywood sucks even more in that regard and if i ever mention that ill get scores of people just telling me to watch bollywood and stop complaining
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah it tends to be that way with characters that arent straight white cis dudeswhether you are a woman a gay person whatever that becomes your defining trait as a person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they dont show up in games because people dont write them into games i love how we can talk about a game with aliens dragons etc but as soon as there is more than one gay character or a trans character or a non white main character we see people up in arms and crying about unrealistic representation what it boils down to is that a lot of people who complain about different groups being represented are perfectly fine with having the odd token character here or there as long as they are the ones that receive the most attention from developers in terms or representation or romance interests its entitlement to the extreme
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cultural marxist lol those darned spooky cultural marxists at it again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the fact that nazis hate life is strange makes me incredibly happy happier thanalmost as happy as marshfield
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive seen too much fanart of her gettin various levels of frisky with widowmaker or mei to think shes anything else at this point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how do you up and downvote here i dont know that i understand it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hope that they explore this more in the inevitable sequel she said her parents try to label her so maybe she is pan and doesnt entirely know how to express that or she could be trans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,danged salad juice warlocks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nothing is wrong with that i just think making sexuality a core part of a character isnt really a good thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when a gay character exists its political but when a straight character exists its normal why are lgbt so uppity s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well guess what you still dont have to think about it its easy simply dont assume that everyone is cishet by default and then you wont have to deal with those unpleasant feelings of your expectations not matching reality the whole it doesnt add to the plot thing is flimsy as hell there are a zillion things in the movie that dont add to the main plot extras comic relief context for the world and situation the story is taking place in nobody flips out about minor straight characters doing straight things in the background or in one line exchanges i guess we need to remove all those too as well as everything that doesnt add to the main storyline except its not that and never has been its an excuse to try to get rid of things they dont like a putting something in movies that i dont want to acknowledge exists is distracting and makes the movie bad i dont want to have to think about see or acknowledge that diversity exists is shitty as hell and is a far far cry from i dont care
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and if i ever mention that ill get scores of people just telling me to watch bollywood and stop complaining ugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the raid and raid though they never really had a big showing in the west
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a codeword thats loaded with antisemitic history i dont know if these people know it or not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the orange one is upvote the blue one is downvote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,click the down arrow to upvote someone everyones score is shown with a in front of it comments that have an actual negative score will have two
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nobody flips out about minor straight characters doing straight things in the background or in one line exchanges i guess we need to remove all those too as well as everything that doesnt add to the main storyline this but unironically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just think of blue stop signs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh shit ive been giving out many downvotes in the past few days
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dude this helps a lot i thought something was wrong with something somewhere when i didnt understand what was going on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,turns out weve been brigading ourselves all along
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its only imaginary internet points anyway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha yeah it took me a while too feel free to ask any questions like that in the daily chat threads
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cant wait for her to release home movies to really bring her into the mainstream in reply to dracosolon on slowly changing into a kardashian at utc altiuscitiusfortius wrote cant wait for her to release home movies to really bring her into the mainstream
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly the first thought i had was her hat is silly i mean i eventually thought of her chest but my thought after silly hats was what the fuck is that beverage will it kill you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for the update
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont wanna know do i
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well this is the same gamecommunity that had a team called alabama ns competing in one of their tournaments and the general consensus was if youre calling them out youre the real problem so yeah not really surprised here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lel black ppl r bad am i the funni man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dota has a wonderful community which has no elitism at all to race or choice of game
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i kinda get the whole lol trigger pc sjw shtick when its a progressive idea that isnt widely accepted yet like nonbinary genders or something like that dont get me wrong its still shitty and obnoxious but i understand why so many people agree with making fun of it but having this kind of reaction to the most racist slur there is in american culture like really thinking the word nr is bad is sjw pc culture now for fucks sake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the pc term for crackers is terrible people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kill all gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i miss the days when the worst you got playing online games was people switching sides and killing your character
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,asa nerd im okay with flying nerd culture into the sun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted great victory against free speech bird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i expected so much more from you lol nah this is exactly what i expected
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gamers are useless to society in so so so so so many ways
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow i play little game called guess the subbreddit with srs i guessed it was going to be low hanging fruit nope fucking dota at this point im perfectly fine destroying all video games
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,looking at the title i thought what the fuck how then i saw the subreddit was for a moba which instantly explained it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for ducks sake edit fucks sake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is causing the issue ns the pc term is basketballamericans dont trigger me and check your white male privilege before posting thanks in reply to alfurion on can you not unmodd everyone you dont know what is causing the issue at utc apalapapa wrote niggers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pure unapologetic racism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait really
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,could you not say that please
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deaths and nothing of value was lost
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont forget the obligatory triggered joak reply
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not nearly enough gold especially for that many upvotes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of any mobas community is horribly toxic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae peruvians are sub human twitchemote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love pretending to be peruvian and receiving racist rants its great
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well this is exactly what free speech activists gamers are fighting for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,suburban americans mayonnaise americans hockey americans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why bother gamers are already dead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know a lot of games have a reputation as the worst community but dota is the real one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the moment games let people talk is the moment they go to shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am but an internet babby and that sounds hilarious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,great victory my friend
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gamers you targeted gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like video games i just hate video game culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,binding of isaac was good tho and valve made several games with well written diverse characters over a decade before the real pressure came in to do so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id be fine with it too as long as i get to keep new vegas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please dont i quite like video games if you want to destroy any form of media destroy tabloids nobody likes those
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the mods deleted some of the more obvious racist commentswhich were upvoted mind but its still pretty damn bad warning may cause you to try and claw out your eyes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,controversial implies some redditors liked it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if anything the world is a better place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this rate we wont need a wallag
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive yet to find a online community that isnt horribly toxic even hearthstone and you can only emote there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i loved the genre i was very much into the original dota back in warcraft probably about years ago now and played mobas for years after that at a certain point the communities became so overwhelmingly crappy that i quit playing the genre entirely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kappawhiteprideworldwide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,blue eyed devils
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gamers gamers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gamers are dead and vivian james isnt real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know gaming in general is full of shitters but seems like in general mobas have the most toxicass communities of them all like holy shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how does a community get worse than league of legends
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i havent even played it and i know dota is the real one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,really over league
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay so i was a newbie in warcraft and i was doing poorly so the foaf broke alliance with me allied with the computer and crushed me im just not efficient enough for blizzard rts titles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were a group of people who will sit for hours days even weeks on end performing some of the hardest most mentally demanding tasks over and over and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did well punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture because we think its fun well spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second many of us have made careers out of doing just these things slogging through the grind all day the same quests over and over hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed systems over heated disks and carts destroyed frustration all to latter be referred to as bragging rights these people honestly think this is a battle they can win they take our media were already building a new one without them they take our devs gamers arent shy about throwing their money else where or even making the games our selves they think calling us racist mysoginistic rape apologists is going to change us weve been called worse things by prepubescent year olds with a shitty head set they picked a fight against a group thats already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods who enjoy the battle of attrition theyve threatened us with who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter our obsession with proving we can after being told we cant is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brotherssisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need a honed reflex gamers are competative hard core by nature we love a challange the worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us youre not special youre not original youre not the first this is just another boss fight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its for the greater good im willing to give up my video games
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were still using this damn site
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i remember ages ago finding a private css server of all places that was noob friendly no hostility to people who are not good at the game and didnt allow racism that was probably about the best experience i had online and even then it was difficult to get a server of people at a time without someone having something shitty to say id love to find a server in any game that is very strict against any form of bigotry and welcoming of people of any skill level and not empty because half the players get upset when they are told they cant say the nword
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,starcraft has a lot of rage but it tends to stay within the confines of the game rather than slinging slurs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,eve online is great because the curve means that usually the year olds that start up this poop quit at least it seemed rather mature a few years ago but ive since stopped playing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is that an ice poseidon emote or destiny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty much any game where youre dependent on a team to win to be honest
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,league at least makes sure that their pro players maintain some level of decency and is a lot more likely to ban players for homophobiaracismsexism ingame dota literally doesnt give a fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,add some elitism thats what dota is league elitism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,y i k e s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,se dirigieron a los jugadores jugadores somos un grupo de personas que se sientan por horas días incluso semanas continuamente para ejecutar una porción de las tareas más difíciles y mentalmente exigentes una otra vez y otra sencillamente por nada más que un chico cospel digital diciendo que lo hicimos nos castigaremos haciendo cosas que otros considerarían como tortura porque pensamos que es divertido dedicaremos la mayoría si no todo nuestro tiempo libre para maximizar las estadísticas de un carácter ficticio sencillamente para obtener un único punto más de daño por segundo muchos de nosotros creamos carreras donde hacemos sencillamente esto trabajar a través de la rutina todo el día las mismas misiones repetidamente cientos de veces al punto donde conocemos cada pequeño detalle hasta que algunos obtienen tal nirvana que pueden jugar a estos juegos con los ojos literalmente vendados ¿esta gente tiene alguna idea de cuantos controladores han sido aplastados sistemas sobrecalentados discos y cartas destruidos en frustración todo para referirse luego como el derecho de jactarse ¿esta gente honestamente cree que esto es una lucha que puedan vencer ¿tomar nuestros medios ya construimos unos nuevos sin ellos ¿tomar nuestros diseñadores los jugadores no tenemos miedo de invertir nuestro dinero en otro sitio o aun diseñar los juegos por nosotros mismos ¿piensan que referirse a nosotros como racistas misóginos o apologistas de las violaciones va a afectarnos impúberes de diez años con auriculares de mierda se refrieron a nosotros más injuriosamente empezaron una lucha contra una demográfica que ya está desensibilizada hacia sus estrategias y métodos que disfruta el conflicto abrasivo con el que nos amenazaron que lo acepta como desafío cuando nos dicen que no importamos más nuestra obsesión con probar que podemos después de habernos dicho que no podíamos está establecido a causa de años de tratar con hermanos y amigos riéndose de lo patético que eramos que probarles a ustedes cuan equivocados están se volvió una necesidad muy real un reflejo agudizado los jugadores son naturalmente competitivos y esforzados adoramos un desafío lo peor que hicieron en todo de esto fue desafiarnos uds no son especiales ni originales ni los primeros esto es sencillamente otra pelea contra el monstruo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol look you made one mad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how about we compromise we put every gamer through emotional maturity screening if they get offended by minorities or scream cuck we get their parents to take away their vidya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,years ago i was part of a super cool gaming clan and we had a forum that was pretty similar they even had a women only section everyone was welcoming and there was no bigotry there were jokes thrown back and forth but they were one hundred percent in good spirit it really makes me anxious letting my daughters play anything online i tried getting them into hearthstone but changed my mind when i beat some guy and he friend requests me to say you should have died in orlando youyou can probably fill in the blanks you can say whatever you want about me im a year old guy its hard to get under my skin but my kids that would make the really upset
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most games like cs with strong dedicated serverbased communities have niches like this sadly the move toward matchmaking has ruined this and made bigotry much more acceptable in gaming communities since there isnt a core group to tell you to fuck off when youre being racist or just an asshole
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,best gaming community ive ever been in were lgbtfriendly guilds in wow when people arent bigots it turns out that it makes gaming a lot more fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my kids have some issues with anger just like i did so id prefer to keep them away from that kind of behaviour until they are able to control it themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think it might just be the cultures the subreddits have created not the actual communities when i played league it was super racist and in this one discussion about video games class i took all the league players were the gamergaters idk i think that class made me instantly assume all league players are trashcans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i remember when then eg player mason was found to say nigga so often in game it in the top most used words by himself of course this is what mason looks like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wasnt that bad then again i havent checked in years
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the ones that are free at least
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id try to translate that to inupiat but my grammar sucks and id need to upload a png or jpg because none of the special characters save for palatized n are in standard latin orthography
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a copy pasta
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly i havent found a csgo server like this i would love to find one i tried ranked play and im too old to put up with all the edgy kids shouting naughty words over their mic or all the hitler profile pictures i mean ive been playing since so i guess i should be used to this but the older i get the less patience i have for this stuff if anyone knows a good server i would love to know about it the community in overwatch seemed sorta decent until i tried the competitive ptr now every second game has someone being hostile and throwing around fbombs not talking about the four letter word
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats fair though im not sure if keeping them away from situations where they have to control their emotions is the way to go though i dont know you or your kids im not gonna pretend i know more than you just in my own experience gaming taught me to control myself and how i feel
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,smug my knuckles are itching
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is definitely better probably because it doesnt feel like it was meant to be played competitively people playing it arent so fucking high strung like they are in dota
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a capital idea to get peer review preferably from an adult native the trick is finding an assistant i would suggest but they currently dont have an option for inupiat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gourmet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that is hilarious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,csgo at least used to have servers like this i havent played for a long time for various reasons so i cant help you out there matchmaking ruined the cs community ill stand by that forever lmao the whole gambling thing surrounding it doesnt help either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a difference between frustrating video games and being called horrible names by man children id prefer to not have my year old daughter who is deep in the throws of puberty be called awful names
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres also custom servers most of the awful people go join their own awful edge lord server which separates them from regular players
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe ill ask my greatuncle he was a consultant on never alone and teaches at one of the universities in state
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it seems like matchmaking ruins any online gaming community to be honest playing with random people seems to attract way too many toxic players which says a whole lot about the gaming community in general
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well my point in the comment that that comes from is that you arent getting that from starcraft at least compared to the other games listed it isnt perfect but the worst youll usually get is about perceived imbalance in the game that and chat isnt at all a requirement to play nothing wrong with just turning it off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,usually its the other way around the dumb shits rule the average valve server just spamming their edgelord binds which is why i only play on two or three community servers with active mods
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill look into it thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if were going to have racist misogynistic altreich conservative assholes in our countries we need armed officers to protect us from them fixed it for you buddy also what do you think p
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was on rnews the very same day this happened people shot in one city in the past week all by nonmuslims also a few months before you probably didnt hear about it because there was no rpics tribute or upvoted news posts on the front page of reedit but notice the lack of collectivization there and lack of faux outrage this is why we call you islamophobes racists and bigots
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spoiler alert there are million muslims already here in america o this is the kind of us vs them mentality that sickens me why cant people just get along why all the fearmongering how can people be so oblivious to others struggles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its difficult to mock someone so blatant ill try if were going to have redditors on the internet we need modsadmins to protect us from their flung words of poop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love the reaction over this and the reaction reddit had when white men killed white cops last month and at least of them were done ambush style but you know race has nothing to do with it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was raised muslim but not really a believer i guess not like hur dur reliegon of potato i just dont care the only reason i still identify as one is to spite the right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny how terrorism isnt excused by any american religious leaders except for extreme right christianity maybe youre the dangerous ones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if were going to have whites in our countries we need armed officers to protect us from them red cloud wants you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,men the cause most of violence we should lock them up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its truly one of the achievements of the propaganda system to make rich white men so terrified of poor muslim refugees that they feel they need armed protection from them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought the us had armed officers to protect them from terrorists of any religiousethnic group
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine being this scared of a religious group with over a billion people in it i mean seriously we joke about it all the time but have these people actually never been outside if these majority collegeaged redditors have ever actually been on a college campus they should see muslims all the time going about their business like normal fucking people but i guess those are the good ones or a false flag operation or whatever other bullshit they come up with and meanwhile we have white frat boys sexually assaulting women and writing shit like build that wall and ners go home on the sidewalks and walls and these people are just one of us according to reddit great
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what about protecting us from white shooters and abortion clinic bombers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if were going to have neonazis in our countries we need armed antifa to protect us from them preferably something queer like bash back
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel like the people who say this shit have never been outside or had a job before i have served many muslim people at the place i work at and they have been nothing but nice and courteous my bad experiences have only come from old white people who think theyre entitled to everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,literal fucking fascism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if were going to have muslims in our countries we need armed officers to protect us from them in reply to sufferinsuccatash on lucky there was an officer nearby he likely saved several lives at utc sironeofyou wrote thank god this wasnt a pathetic european country where all the average cop would be able to do is to prostrate themselves before him and beg him to stop i say this as an englishman if were going to have muslims in our countries we need armed officers to protect us from them httpiimgurcomsfncorppng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i say we arm the muslims to protect us from the officers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cowards
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spoiler alert im pretty sure that america has killed more muslims than muslim terrorists have killed american citizens
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cause we gotta get people elected and fear works way too well on the uninformed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously i am in the same boat not really a muslim anymore but it is still the culture i was raised in i still identify as muslim just to annoy these fucks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah all those abortion clinics and black churches obmbed are false flag attacks or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,capitalism is the cause of most violence we should lock it up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,statistics prove this so by their logic yes all men should be watched
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kind of we have armed officers to guard capitalism and shoot people of color
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dunno man california is so large that europe can be included into it you can walk miles before you met any moooslems s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no you see its totally different because muslims are actually bad rightwingers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah raltright likes it even more that way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,eh i never liked that much because they twist it back on us and say kill all men replace men with jew and that sounds kinda naziish you nazi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,careful youll give them ideas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cooldagbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clinton is behind all of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,use four hashes to make everything rainbow a good first pasta attempt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait if im not a germanic or a nordic do i squeak by and not have the inherent evils oliver cromwell tried to genocide my peeps back in the day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,capitalism also something which came into being due to men coincidence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but watching what men do is harmful for your sanity there would be ai programs going on strikes on the first day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,islam isnt a race beckyvoice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean they call themselves nazis sorry natsoc for that lovely orwellian flair why are they surprised when people call them that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes but we dont actually mean kill all men just as long as we bash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how much benned gifs you have anyways chuckle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,soros
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is communist hulk a thing it should be a thing

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,c o m m u n i s m
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stalinism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow the mommy hate is strong in this one like my mum likes to sand the dry skin off her heels while we watch movies its a loud and somewhat disgusting process sometimes my dad and his friends give her shit for it but shes just totally unapologetic because a shes done a full weeks work and thats how she unwinds and shows herself love and b chances are shes cooked dinner for everyone already that night and c you can bet your bottom dollar the remains of their tea and biscuits will sit on that coffee table until the apocalypse unless she tidies up after them so theres a tacit acknowledgement that she can do whatever the fuck she wants on movie night movie night is family time if that means listening to all the noises everyone is making and she is not the only one who makes noises then fair enough if you want to watch a movie in silence then go lock yourself in your bedroom
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean take your pick ive been told this type of stuff my whole life but i was a pushover and now i dont give flying fuck about anyone unless theyre signing my checks soon ill be signing my own pay checks i googled this to see if they were quoting like fight club or some shit but i guess they actually talk like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ironicat ironicatironicat ironicatironicatironicat ironicatironicatironicatironicat ironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicatironicat what is up with all these redditors that take all this time to think about destroying people like this what a terrible use of your time edgypost
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or maybe just say hey thats rude and we are trying to watch the movie if yo uwant to do something else please leave and do that next time you wont get an invite if you disrupt everything so hard dont need to kill anyones dreams or piss in anyone cheerios
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,soon ill be signing my own paychecks someone managed to slog through atlas shrugged
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,adviceanimals is practically low hanging fruit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this totally happened if it did wouldnt a simple complaint be enough to have her removed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly dont know how that man got word for word what i got banned for from adviceanimals but damn was i fucked up back in the day holy shit i know that rant id know it anywhere it has markings of a crazy twoscoop edit i can feel the rage coursing through me and the terrible grammar i produced
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people this full of themselves dont feel guilt you have to punish them they only understand embarrassment find their weakness exploit it watch them fall apart could be as simple as calling them a fat ass saying thats why no one calls you on your birth day in reply to jogaklaa on just be petty about it pause the movie when she does that stuff and stare at her until she stops shell probably ask why you stopped the movie so tell you didnt want to distract her from her more important other video at utc xmanatomic wrote people this full of themselves dont feel guilt you have to punish them they only understand embarrassment find their weakness exploit it watch them fall apart could be as simple as calling them a fat ass saying thats why no one calls you on your birth day i mean take your pick ive been told this type of stuff my whole life but i was a pushover and now i dont give flying fuck about anyone unless theyre signing my checks soon ill be signing my own pay checks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,soon ill be signing my own paychecks and then nobody can stop me from being a complete and utter shithead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that is a bot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rip big ironicat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and also be aware that a mother doesnt need to be invited to her own living room
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i honestly dont know how it even got posted again yes again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so someone took twice as long to post something shitty oof
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was saddened by big ironicats passing but i understand that it needed to be done more ironicats is the same as one big ironicat thats what helps me cope
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no they stole it from someone word for word and posted it on the subreddit where it was most likely banned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not just a shitposter a shitposter whos tracing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youll need to contact the mods to find that out the reason will be good though the mods here dont take decisions on the smileysthis sub in general lightly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this had to be like some next level shit they saved it from years ago
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so glad i unsubbed from videos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,upwards of a third of the time were talking about something very different from a man a woman its almost as if rape isnt limited to male on female piv rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit the todd akin of web sites
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know girls who were raped and they were all by guys who were first to say that rape rates are bullshit one thought he was gods gift to the world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were at the point where if i hear someone has a reddit account i immediately want to know if theyre a redditor or a decent human being
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but for some reason the answer i get is always you absolute asshole i am far too logical to make sense of their emotional reaction
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,racial justice is all about whites mistreating blacks and nothing else and diversity is essentially all about having less white people this is literally repackaged neonazi white genocide bullshit but its fine because as a liberal uracialinjusticethw is totes not a member of the altright also its relatively harmless now but what happens when white people are of the population and are minorities who have been brought up to believe all their problems are due to white people and its fine to say racist and discriminatory stuff about whites what happens when those same people become our judges politicians etc fucking hell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,new age rape thats where the rapist is white andor famous right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whole thread is nauseating
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,might be a good idea to castrate all men as a preventative measure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is what rape culture looks like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because youre a piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,time for another round of reddit comment or your awful republican uncles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were at the point where if i hear someone was raped i immediately want to know was it a real rape or a new age rape in reply to justhach on this honestly pisses me off so much this is the exact kind of shit that turned feminism from a human rightsequality movement to an insult for people you disagree with its like do these fucking selffocused ignoramuses not realise that shit like this and not the patriarchy is the reason that theres doubt whenever a woman claims sexual harassmentrape not every trivial instance and interaction where you feel insulted or threatened is tantamount to harassment and as a double whammy now redpillers and douchebags advocates can parade this video around as evidence that all feminists are crazy at utc mustangarrett wrote were at the point where if i hear someone was raped i immediately want to know was it a real rape or a new age rape that sounds terrible but upwards of a third of the time were talking about something very different from a man forcing his penis into a woman without her consent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were at the point where if i hear someone was raped i immediately want to know if they are being treated in an appropriate manner and if the person who did such a terrible thing to them is being prosecuted side note their calling it new age rape smacks of a fundamental misunderstanding of consent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly ive had to unsub from a lot of normal subs because of stuff like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same its fucking awful
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and these people are the first to point that out is that irony im pretty sure that counts as irony
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that last paragraph is hilarious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its almost like the answer would be to stop discriminating and being racist but nah gotta keep whitey on top
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah they dont have to be famous it only counts if theyre not white and even then the victim doesnt need sympathy its just a sign people who arent white are evil
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i purged a lot of the default subs from my list and i immediately noticeed that i have all these other quite active subs that are really interesting but i never saw them because i got distracted by the default subs also the absence of hate its like ive entered smooth sailing waters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty much the only good big subs left are the sports ones imo i usually dont see racist garbage and such in rcfb and other subs like that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont sub to anything nonfempire i do visit rforwardsfromgrandma a lot but but it sometimes gets overrun with shitty people as well as having some resident shitty people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the irony is lost on them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the projection if you switched white people and minorities itd be much more accurate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had a years absence from reddit quite a while ago grew a lot in terms of the kind of person i am when i came back my first move was removing every default sub from my list cut the potential of blatant bigotry i see aside from subs meant to expose it ofc down quite a bit and made reddit so much more bearable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty much unfortunately although i find some smaller subreddits are fine and remo has enforced some pretty heavy sjw rules so im happy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ooh dramatic irony
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a hockey player in my city was recently convicted of raping a year old in a nightclub bathroom a few years ago and the amount of women defending him in the comments for news articles is disgusting i dont understand why so many people victim blame all these middle aged women are commenting things like thats what she gets for going to a bar at and shes just ashamed of herself and wants someone else to pay these are all facebook comments so theres no anonymity it makes me so sad that theres that many women out there who will victim blame other women for being raped theres even a support page for the rapist and from the looks of it its a bunch of hockey moms whining about how his career is down the drain what the hell is wrong with society if anyone wants to read about it httpwindsorstarcomnewslocalnewsbenjohnsonsentencedtothreeyearsforforciblecriminalsexualassault it looks like the site removed the entire comments section but on their facebook page comments are still allowed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hello
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,comic book fans are really dumb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really wish that i could get some stim toys in malaysia that would be real nice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow what the fuck that guy honestly deserves a longer sentence then he got i just hope the victims been doing okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and then people wonder why survivors dont come forward fox news response to trumps accusers has been to shame them to insult them to dissect their lives and then to share their addresses and not a single one of those pieces of shit has been fired
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hello
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,honestly im kind of scared that he wont lose i dont even live in the states but the amount of people ive met whos line of thinking is is rather have a racist sexist shitty president then hillary is shocking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of my fav stim toys is just slime which is really easy to make
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hello
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,by the numbers it seems pretty unlikely hell win and gary johnsons support is high enough that itll eat into those independent south park voter types and the proweed wing of the republican electorate so if you dont live in a swing state vote for stein or akavian or whoever and dont let anybody shame you for it on edit i need to put a s after the vote akavian pitch please dont vote for him if it werent for the constant racism and sexism he spews and if he was just running as a total dumbass id maybe vote for him since hopefully his ineffectiveness would minimize the amount of bombings corporate handouts and rich people tax breaks america does but hed probably just resign and wed end up with pence which would be frightening
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive been thinking of doing that too how do you make slime ive been looking for chewy and feely things too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,greets to thee it is i your trans necromancer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,btw how do you think why has hillarys lead been constantly eroded after the last debate according to five thirtyeight at least
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,um basically you need glue and borax theres lots of tutorials online theres also places you can buy chew jewelry online i need extra strong ones because i bite right through the normal ones p
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,would that be where you can only raise trans people from the dead or is it that when you bring someone back from the dead they switch genders or does it just mean youre a necromancer who happens to be trans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would guess the wikileaks stuff but i couldnt tell you however shes still very much ahead of trump its still important for everyone to go out and vote though especially people in swing states
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hillarys support has never been high trump and hillary both have historically low levels of popular support and approval for candidates this isnt a new trend the american electorate has turned out in historically low numbers for nonpresidential campaigns the past several election cycles so it could just be creeping apathy seeping into the presidential race that said i think a huge chunk of itmost of itis misogyny and not even that just some year long character assassination campaign
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks ive tried stimtastic but the shipping cost literally doubles the price of the stim toys im buying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the last one im just a trans gal who likes to engage in the dark arts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love the dark arts tell me more
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love the ability to use necromancy to summon undead minions to do my bidding mostly menial things like paperwork and punching reactionaries in the face idk if its under the purview of the dark arts but i have been at least somewhat intrigued by the concept of succubi seems cool to me at least
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sign me up for an undead minion i hate jumping through the hoop that is paperwork
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,paperwork is garbagei would send you a minion but im probably really far away from you and i doubt a decomposing shambling semiliterate walking corpse would survive the tropics for long without magical protection
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre right and i live in a more southern area of the us so i imagine the stench from the heat would be a bit much after a while i guess ill have to stick to calling spirits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can go the elder scrolls route and call a spirit into a shambling corpse thus achieving the best of both worlds p
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but dont they have a job how can you joke about mcdonalds employees not wanting jobs if they have a job by definition
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anyone who has ever worked a min wage job knows that they are some of the toughest jobs around you work your ass off you dont sit around in your office hiding from your boss browsing reddit all day you also gotta deal with daily so thats a big fucking chore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow thats a cranky old republican joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,daily dose of classism from the very liberal site known also as the front page of the internet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,believes mcdonalds should continue existing believes its workers dont deserve a livable wage doesnt appreciate that other people claim they believe mcdonalds workers should live in poverty redditurds only like logic when they can pervert it to suit themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god forbid minorities feed their families
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone has to make the arbys sauce im saying that guy should have enough money for the most basic life necessities im not so sure that we have come far enough as a species to make that a reality and also treat harder working people fairly just yet yes we have not come far enough as a species living in the richest country to have ever existed on the face of the planet to ensure that our citizens can afford the most basic of necessities thats obviously true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bootstrapping intensifies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shockingly that thread went from zero empathy for minimum wage workers to eugenics real quickly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,businesses that pay their employees poverty wages are passing the costs of labor onto the taxpayer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on mcdonalds workers protesting for higher wages fortunatelythese protests usually only last days or sobecause any more of an effort and it seems like a job and they disband at utc faughnjj replied to fortunatelythese protests usually only last days or sobecause any more of an effort and it seems like a job and they disband
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not a real job you need to have some sort of middleclass office job to have valid opinions see youre trying to use logic on these statements when they werent intended to be logical they start with the beliefs that poor people are inherently flawed unions are greedy and then find some sort of bullshit criticism that simply discredits them and makes them easy to ignore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they dont actually care about whether people have jobs they just hate poor people its why the same commentors are saying poor people shouldnt be allowed to have children in their mind being poor is a punishment for doing something wrong anyone who is poor deserves to suffer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if only mras made it this obvious all the time women would be able to just avoid this kind of toxicity most of them harbor their misogyny silently and just treat women badly without making a fuss about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh my god i cant imagine having to talk with a redditor irl jesus christ
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can i point out how reddit stopped caring about this video in less than a day yet hugh mungus jokes are still being made
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rush limbaugh or altright redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ikr i grew up in a middle class suburban family and heard shit like this all the time so this mustve just struck a chord with me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if we paid fast food employees enough so they didnt live in poverty we couldnt use the job as an insult anymore though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for true redditry find people saying that mcds shouldnt continue existing because they get explosive diarrhea every time they eat there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the same logic that makes them feel obliged to play games they arent fond of then complain about it afterwards for upvotes i feel its silly that complaining and cynicism are the epitome of intelligence now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,their morals are as weak as their bowels
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cry endlessly about consent real weird way to say that people are against rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think guys should have to be upfront about their bigotry im not trans but i do not want to have relations with someone who is so upset at the idea of a trans woman that they compare it to rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,she took away your choice to what valuable conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did this dude seriously compare getting raped to having surgery to change your sex please dont tell me this is real life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have seen them argue just that on the grounds that they are a manwoman they just had surgery to correct a mistake not everybody shares the same view of transgenderism as a genetic accident some view it as a mental disorder that is easier to fix surgically than to treat so its your opinion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only time reddit will bring up consent go figure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anybody else see this in the following comments some shithead acknowledges that trans people being open about their status invites assault and murder but still claims its their right to know if their partners trans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but he consented what the fuck is the problem he even said hes okay with it also the idea that she was lying about being a woman or that shes actually a man is just wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so if ive had both my appendix and my gallbladder out do i have to tell this to everyone i sleep with ok before we lay down i have to tell you some things sit down thisll take a while at i had a tooth removed when i was i had my appendix removed i think the ingrown toenail was so i would have been anyway theres lots more lemme get the diagrams
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,an anti feministonce again trying to sound smartsaying what they said with confidence and here i am sitting here thinking what in gods name did i just read
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so basically what this guy is asking for is the right to have consensual sex and accuse the woman of rape when he decides he regrets it later hmm where have we heard that before edit lol at all the deleted comments im never gonna read good job trying to redefine your regretted sex as rape and constantly whining about feminists doing the same thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sex under false pretenses i want to see the example they think of here like i can think of people arguing that taking off a condom without their partner knowing is rape but what else is there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that was a really wordy way of saying i do not understand rape or consent and also i hate trans people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,come again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont get how feminists cry endlessly about consent sex under false pretenses etc and in the same breath defend trans peoples rights to omit something as huge as having had a sex change operation she took away your choice in the matter its lying by omission and its fucked up in reply to on those who have had sex with someone who has had a sex change how did it throwaway because shes not out to the world and people in my life know my account i had a year relationship with a mtf postop we went from chatting at a bar to playing at a bdsm club to fucking in about a month and a half not entirely out of the norm id guess she said shed started on hormones pretty late but also had a very delayed puberty so that sort of evened out and then went to thailand at we met about years after she had surgery all that to say that she had slim hips a slim bone structure pretty much nothing pointed to born male appears female her vagina looked like a vagina theres enough variety in the world that i didnt inspect it vigorously to determine how it came about she had some small breasts that werent implants basically i didnt know sex was great we needed lube but the only uncommon thing about that for me in many cases is that we needed it right at the start instead of first sometime in the middle it was tight it was soft it was warm it was very wet because we used lube and it was sex with someone i was already mentally in love with also breasts and my hand around her throat a good time she told me she was trans in a public place a little while later she was worried about what sort of reaction i might have to learning that the whole you tricked me into fucking a dude now im going to kill you thing but i just didnt care this is actually something ive thought about a lot since and i wish she had told me ahead of time i understand why she didnt but its still something she kept me from having informed consent about since i didnt care to begin with i havent stayed too worried about it our relationship went really strongly for a bit over a year and we ended up breaking up over personality meshing issues a regular old breakup but even by the end the sex was still great at utc saltedcaramelsauce wrote i wish she had told me ahead of time i understand why she didnt but its still something she kept me from having informed consent about isnt that the crux of the whole issue i dont get how feministsliberalswhatever cry endlessly about consent sex under false pretenses etc and in the same breath defend trans peoples rights to omit something as huge as having had a sex change operation she took away your choice in the matter its lying by omission and its fucked up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seconding what
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wah wahhh why do people like you keep crying about forced exsanguinations
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i had a dollar for every time feminists and liberals were considered oversensitive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,easy say youre mtf trans and if they react negatively walk away and if they exclaim that they couldnt tell at all boink away
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the reason the people on that thread are making the comparison to rape is because they would lift their consent if they knew the other person was trans sure the values behind that decision are questionable and i believe based on bigoted ideas but once they actually would i can get why they would find omission of such factor a problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,choice to be overtly transphobic i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i follow the argument correct they are saying they withdraw consent if its a trans person if they find out somehow during or before edit superfluous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nonono he compared rape to having sex with a trans woman much better s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the whole thread is shit and full of people trying to debate that trans women arent women because of their feels and also that theyll somehow become gay from having piv sex with a woman also the idea that its lying is fucked up theyre women trying to say that they are men because of bigotry and these peoples ignorance about what gender even is is the real lie
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes some people view being transgender as a mental illness some people are wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,antiscience transphobia ableism but redditors are rational
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit seems to think consensual means not involving a trans person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nothing else matters trans must risk murder to make the sensitive cis feel comfortable allow them to be transphobic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how about my right to know before we go any further theres something i have to tell you whatwhat is it im a redditor always have been what does that mean it means i will value my own comfort over your life should it come to that are you okay i think i need a minute im not sure if i can sleep with someone who has no empathy for me take your time but know that if you turn me down i will call you slurs and insult your appearance and pretend like i was never attracted to you in the first place sure that goes without saying im not sure what that was just now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the thing is they didnt even see a penis according to the op the person replying to op just wants an excuse to be outraged and hate trans people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,masculinity so fragile that even sleeping with a woman can threaten it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just wait until we get to the open heart surgery
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont forget the xrays you cant bone someone without having seen their bones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i usually seem them comparing it to someone not informing you beforehand if they have an std i dont get this though that could actually harm you having sex with a trans person wont harm you i guess if youre straight and they havent had surgery yet then maybe there could be an issue but in that case you just back out and say no but if you have sex with them and its all good and then you find out later that they were trans what is there to be upset over at that point the only thing you would be upset about is the fact that they were trans which is transphobic its like being mad at someone for finding out theyre half black after sex or something if you couldnt tell before or during and it upsets you for some reason then the only thing upsetting you is your own racism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thirding can someone please translate this to english
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,money would lose all value we would drown in a sea of washingtons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id short it then bet on a followup comment talking about foreskin and jail rape even more slaveronbill
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean maybe theyll kill you but at least they wont have slept with a trans person s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the thing is theres a virtually infinite number of ways you can lie before having sex with someone and some unknowable subset of those lies might result in the opposite choice being made these people arent advocating that you give someone your unabridged life story prior to sex theyre not even advocating that you have to honestly answer any given question before sex i guarantee you that at least some subset of them would have had less sex in their lifetimes if either policy were in place theyre only advocating for rape by omission in the one area where such omission hurts them theyd probably also advocate for it in a handful of other places some might care about number of previous partners others might demand a detailed list of the times a birth control pill was consumed in the past days point is they only care about their own ability to get laid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,which is fine i dont think there are any feminists who would say you have to have sex with someone you dont want to in fact its feminists who say you can withdraw consent at any moment so whats this guys point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its creepy as fuck to me me that many of the comments start with throwaway for obvious reasonswhich is essentially to say yeah i slept with a trans woman but im ashamed and embarrassed and i dont want anyone to find out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the fact that thread is marked as serious shows how shitty the askreddit mods are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,genius
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,duh women have cooties which is the worst std known to science
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no all of what you said is stupid and wrong a trans woman is a woman being roofied is literally never okay he could remove his consent at any time what are you on about girl get your shot together
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is blatantly the account you use only when you have something moronically offensive to sayif what you have to say is so valid and truthful then why dont you come here with your actual account oh thats right its because the things you have to say are just useless garbage and youre clearly just a cowardice child go somewhere else
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i personally would want to know if the genitalia i am about to come in contact with are different from what i expect if for no other reason than so my own reaction to surprise penis doesnt ruin things otherwise it just comes down to the idea of boxing in your own sexuality at best
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sure if you try really hard to read it that way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hope you disclose youre cis otherwise i cant consent also fuck off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a guy on the internet once said he slept with a female but it was really a slur and this totally happened and now it is my deepest anger fear and i will talk about it every day because it totally happens repeat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill be honest with you this is complicated rape by deception is complicated on in its own as it should involve the analisis of the context in which the actions happened mostly because we should check for the persons intention when not mentioning something like if i know you are a lesbian and pretend im a woman to sleep with you it would be rape however if my uncle killed your father and i knew you had sworn revenge against my clan and proceeded the sleep with you while hiding my family name then yeah i it would be rape as you can see it involves the actual knowledge by the persons part that they are hiding information that would make the person negate consent so yeah a postop trans person cant really know the person they are sleeping with are actually bigoted so they wouldnt be raping someone just from sleeping with them however if there was a dude whos famous for beeing the figurehead of a transphobic group and a trans person activelly worked for hiding their transition and sleep with them then i actually think it would be rape this discussion in there however is stupid af because they are talking about trans people simply not stating something about themselves all the time just so we know not to sleep with you like fuck if a trivial thing like this matters to them so much then the least expected is that they ask about it before
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i saw it more as i dont want people on reddit to harass my real account because they can be assholes but maybe im just not cynical enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how does a boy potentially having to see a penis make transphobia i thought it was a economic and social system that enforce behavioral roles onto people regardless of aptitude or taste but it could be either tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if i am disgusted by the idea of having sex with someone who likes country music is it fucked up if they fail to tell me they like country music before we have sex
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your preference is transphobic sorry im just not attracted to black people its a preference sounds a bit racist right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont think thats a fair point why do transfolks owe that to everyone what does it matter edit okay nm saw your other response below asshole
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pretty sure youre just not cynical enough but maybe ill be a bit more optimistic and take your view
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont get how feminists cry endlessly about consent sex under false pretenses etc and in the same breath defend crackers rights to omit something as huge as liking country music they took away your choice in the matter its lying by omission and its fucked up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people who want to argue that point should read
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre running out of straw dude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if it can be withdrawn at anytime i think transphobic people think that means they can withdraw consent after sleeping with a transgender person after finding out about the reassignment i dont think the idea that being a phobe doesnt entitle you to act like a victim because being a phobe is selftaught victimization notice how whenever they make themselves out to be the real victim its always to justify some course of action they want the satisfaction of being wronged but have no intention of recognizing their own vulnerabilities which might actually reveal where they themselves were victimized like i dont know being taught all this phobe bullshit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but the premise is that you cannot tell that they are trans so they only reason to care seems to be preexisting prejudices
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fail to see how that is relevant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,am i the only one who finds it odd than in reddit chan communities its completely cool to be sexually attracted to trans women traps but the moment the discussion shifts to speaking about them as people rather than sexual objects their views do a complete actually never mind this is basically how cis women are treated as well so its not even remotely surprising fucking sick of hearing how we dont need feminism when the concept of femininity itself is constantly looked down upon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not transphobic i jack off to traps all the time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,girl guy porn girls girl half man half woman woman a trans woman is not half man half woman that would be a werewoman a man who becomes a woman under a full moon or alternatively if one of my parents is a woman and the other is a man then i am half man half woman a trans woman is woman
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anyone else find the use of traps incredibly disgusting im still not sure how that word gained traction here granted reddit is a shithole but i was hoping that at least one thing from would stay there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive never heard of any gay men who fancy traps in fact
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought they were talking about like bear traps or something and i was like you know more power to you i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no i am attracted to a beautiful woman dae think im gay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,altered nonpc language he doesnt seem to understand that this is just the tip of the fucked up poop iceberg that is his post
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,op would probably be a lot happier if they acknowledged that who theyre attracted to is nothing to be ashamed of and even consistent with their nominal orientation rather than assuming that everyone else in their generation feels the same attractions and the same shame
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,omg look at them all trying desperately to justify and prove to each other that theyre not gay for liking transgender porn its like being in middle or high school again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,m
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair laverne cox is gorgeous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these fucking idiots cant even get that shit right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what is the gayest thing youve done jacked it to traps but name me a millennial who hasnt at utc replied to jacked it to traps but name me a millennial who hasnt httpiimgurcomoxlxsvcpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,am i the only one who finds it odd than in reddit chan communities its completely cool to be sexually attracted to trans women traps but the moment the discussion shifts to speaking about them as people rather than sexual objects their views do a complete yeah this is why socalled transattracted cis men chasers are not very well received in the trans community to say the least
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill take im insecure about my toxic masculinity for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah fetishization
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you should check out internet murder revenge fantasy by merritt kopas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the same reason theyre cool with having waifus but hate women theyre insecure self loathing man children who deserve nothing short of chemical castration and ostracization from society at large all praise the brd femlord pbuh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a little different theres heaps more shame and the potential ones masculinity or sexuality to be called into question if someone finds out youre attracted to trans women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and fuck seth mcfarlane along with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats the quote cant findrecognize it in the thread just link it of you dont want to repeat it i can understand not wanting to type out any seth mcfarlanes bile
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats the quote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont hate women i love having sex with them im not racist i once spent time with a black person and didnt call them a slur once im not homophobic im in favor of gay marriage i just hate it when they act gay im not actually a right wing shit stain i like free college and legal gay weed so like im totally progressive i mean yes i have a strong distaste toward anyone thats different than me but i dont watch fox news like my grandpa i trust real news sources like breitbart they call out all those uppity poor people homos transgenders and blacks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my best friend is a n
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a werewoman thank you for helping me define myself in a way that i have never been able to properly express
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,werewoman sounds spooky they must be the feminist allies from mens lib s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or a boy who becomes a girl when splashed with cold water
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when i changed my name after coming out as trans i was really tempted to change my last name as it contains trap but i figure the term will eventually die out heres hoping
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,many users from probably like reddit because there are more subs for more of their interests and the diversity of users here gives them more people to shit on also since reddit is me vanilla and made to look more tolerant and amazing the self righteous users can circle jerk more easily because the users here convince themselves that theyre part of a good community at least is self aware
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i honestly didnt know what it meant until i read these comments i thought they were talking about the muscles the traps like oh i go to the gym nice traps bro no homo though because im manly and straight but actually its so much worse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on the one hand i want to be happy that a redditor admitted its totally natural to be attracted to transgendered individuals but naturally he also had to objectify them use a slur and then try to explain that hes totally not gay so you know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just to let you know this study is absolute bullshit full of holes you could drive a semi through and ogi ogas is a misogynistic stemlord piece of shit who has an axe to grind about what the feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemales find sexy to the point of altering his own study and his own university cut him off and told him he could no longer associate with them i can provide receipts if youre interested in a read but yeah his methodology is total shite and he obviously had a conclusion in mind before he even started and twisted the data to prove it as a trans person one of the very few studies that arent done by ogi misogyny ogas ive been able to find on transattracted men shows that the majority self identify as some flavour of bisexual also traps are different from the stuff plenty of dudes who selfidentify as gay are interested in traps which are essentially very feminine malesfemboys
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought they meant people with big traps the muscles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,technically traps are back muscles not shoulder muscles easy confusion though as most people only see their traps in the space between their neck and deltoids shoulders
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its amazing that there are still so many people that vilify anything other than heterosexuality and how fucking many of them are atheists and still somehow promote these awful ideologies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the porn industry is wrong and honestly a lot of this has to do with internalized homophobia this has no bearing on the fact that trans women are women though i am a trans guy with a trans female girlfriend and we are our genders lol ill just quote the popular trans blogger kat blaque on this one yeahi dont know theres justtheres something wrong to me when you see a beautiful woman and all you keep coming back to is dick dick dick dick dick dick dick dick the majority of men into trans porn have a penis fetish they use and objectify trans women because they feel they have plausible deniability in one of the few studies done for trans attracted men self identified bisexuals were the highest demographic the myth that trans porn is marketed solely to heterosexual men is a lie and its because internalized and externalized homophobia has permeated western society the woman attached to the penis is as my girlfriend says just feminine life support for the almighty cock to these men tldr mainstream trans porn is disgusting and exploitative and the fact that they lie and say its a completely straight bro pursuit has zero bearing on trans women themselves it just shows the lengths cis men will go to in order to try and justify what makes their diddle piddle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just like the attack helicopter is about otherkin and not transgender people amirite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for the peen update mate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cool story bro
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are not very well received in the trans community to say the least i can imagine i mean theyre essentially reducing you to a fetish and objectifying you in the extreme that kind of shit is really really uncomfortable as well as pretty much necessarily transphobic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is it rare for trans woman to be attracted to straight cis men in your experience just curious because i really dont know very many trans people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reminds me of antigay politicians who end up getting caught having gay affairs or adventures
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh poor babies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at some point he became the thing he was supposedly parodying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when that episode of family guy about quagmires mom being an amab trans woman came out he said something about how its probably the most protrans thing on tv at the tme like seriously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,any time seth macfarlane acts like an ally i want him to choke on his own shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is from the same movie where the main character goes through a court proceeding to establish that he is a sentient person deserving of the same rights as anyone else and there were intentional parallels made between teds struggle and lgbt rights in the us and in that same movie in the same breath mcfarlane has that very same character denying us our genders and who we always were while at the same time fetishising us as mere objects of some perverse sexual attraction that teds friend calls a disease fuck you seth mcfarlane god i fucking hope you realise how much of a shit you are some day and i hope it hits you hard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is why im not in favor of the term altright it just sounds so benign reactionaries are usually defined by the religiosity of people so because these guys hate religion some people think they shouldnt be lumped in that category but their arguments come straight from their parents and grandparents who argue from religious morality hatred of trans and gays is a cultural heritage for christians hatred of anyone other than someone with white skin is a cultural heritage for american christians theyve just been using religion to try to justify their hatred now this generation just openly hates and has no justification other than that they want to live out wild fantasies of committing murder and violence against anyone who is different than them how can you label such people as altright
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not racistsome of my best slaves are black
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not racist i once spent time with a black person and didnt call them a slur once more like im not racist i like some music made by black people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,strictly speaking sure but people generally refer to werewolves as half man half wolf not man wolf so thats where the rationale comes from
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well a werewolf doesnt really transform into a wolf it depends on the depiction but they typically have some combination of wolf and human features like a wolf head claws walk upright abs so when transformed theyre half man half wolf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ou on when that starts popping up on redpill
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if my reading in sexology and time spent on the internet has taught me anything its if anyone ever says there arent any who like then thats probably a false statement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats because trans men are men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,transgender is the more appropriate term right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in my community and in some academic work transsexual is coming back as a legitimate term i myself use transsexual because transgender seems to focus a lot of the persons experience and transition around their gender while myself has extremely been focused on the body i have friends who are both transsexual and transgender and we experience transitioning much differently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant disagree my comment was targeted at the idea that trans porn is a gay genre when the gender politics and sexual dynamics of it all are for more nuanced and complicated than simply two dicks instagay i probably should have made that more clear
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now he needs to brexit out of here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,complete opposite of rare lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trans man but im married to a cis boy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nope i married two
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was more so thinking of how that affects trans women like me and leads to things like trans panic being legitimate defense tactics in murder trials
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is almost as if spending your whole life being a shithead ironically isnt so far from just being a shithead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i havent seen the episode but i could easily see that being the case its a really really low bar
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hmmm how can i make chicks with dicks even more offensive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uuugggghhhh so fucking stupid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not racistsome of my best slaves are black im stealing this its perfect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not racist im subscribed to rblackpeopletwitter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ew
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok i fucked it up i meant to say many redditors probably like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep or trans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,right and i agree with everything youve said i just try and educate where i can because unfortunately ogi ogas see my other comments in this thread for more on this douchebro and his studies has spread a lot of misinformation that has contributed to a very big misconception about who consumes trans porn and why and when something is packaged in such a way to appeal to men who are ashamed of liking something that could be considered not rigidly heterosexual they can use pseudoscience evopsych nonsense and terrible methodology to claim that their penis fetish is a totally straightbro pursuit and that all straight dudes secretly want a large throbbing penisyou can see why its complicated and seeing people crow its straight is kind of a headache even for a trans person theres a difference between accepting a trans person is their identified gender and cis peoples hardcore fetishization of transgender bodies based off of extremely fetishy porn made specifically to cater to the taboo fantasies of cis men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats sort of what i assumed thanks i guess the important factor is that the vast majority of trans people dont want to be in a relationship with someone who sees their identity as a sexual fetish hence why chasers are unpopular
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id hope a cis man would never treat me nor anyone else the way most of them treat women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how is attracted to nonsensical
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i can understand that trans guy here myself so thats kind of where i was coming from with that statement the original comment almost sounded like you were giving cis guys a pass i understand you arent now this is just what i thought before and since my girlfriend is also trans i was immediately like no uhuh they dont get a pass for acting like trans women are something to be ashamed of its such a hard line to walk between acceptance and dealing with the horrible fetishization issue trans people in general and trans women especially have regarding cis people viewing our bodies as sexual taboo novelties disregarding our struggle our own sexual agency and the fact that our bodies arent minted in a porno factory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,counterpoint whatever you think of stephen colbert hes certainly not the character he played on the colbert report
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hes always been a brogressive piece of shit hes never been good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at one point in the episode brian the dog mind you spends several minutes projectile vomiting at the thought of having been attracted to a trans women a dog nevermind where the bar existed on tv at the time the message that trans women are so disgusting that theyre not even worth being viewed positively by a talking cartoon dog is definitely way way under that bar by the way this came out the same year an episode of house aired portraying a trans child in a relatively sympathetic and positive light as she and her mother struggle to allow her to keep her sense of femininity against the wishes of her father who has custody and is demanding that she cut her hair and stop looking so feminine the bar was set much higher than seth mcfarlane can even imagine in his warped little bubble worldview where women are objects and trans women are disgusting vomitinducing objects not worthy even of affection from a dog
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in rhode island we watch it mostly for the rhode island jokes other than that id say youre probably spot on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trap is usually meant for trans women because society is extremely and violently centered around male heterosexuality i know gay men who are into trans men well yeah they are men after all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imo you can drop the star it was only used for a little while and a lot of nb people were upset because it was saying they werent trans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aaaaaaabsolutely i would never ever want to be in a relationship where my partner values me as a sexual object more than an actual person with actual emotions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id say that applies to a lot more than trans women too white guys with a fetish for blackasian girls are the creepiest people you will ever meet in your life
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yup exactly just like basically every other woman hmm its almost like were people or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most chasers arent attracted to you theyre attracted to your penis thats okay for some folks and honestly i think its fine for someone to be a chaser i even know a couple chasers who are very nice polite and understanding people however some chasers treat all trans women as fetish objects and nothing else
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i can definitely see that reading
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no though unfortunately he fetishizes the military and is a pretty standard liberal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah but house wasnt satire s but seriously family guy managed to fail to meet my low expectations of it ugh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how does it say that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fetish for blackasian girls whats the difference between fetish and preference or is it the same thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its really so obvious it kind of wasnt worth pointing out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think they are responding to this as long as they treat me like any other woman that kind of implies that cis women are generally treated well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah its a joke theyre saying cis men treat cis women like shit so they hope theyd treat you better but i get what you are saying and no youre not wrong for desiring a romanticsexual relationship with cis men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess i meant it in a fairly broad way sexually attracted to desiring a relationship with etc but yeah youre right i couldve been more specific
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,satire only works as a comedic device when its david taking potshots at goliath with his little tiny ineffective slingshot the moment its goliath stomping david into the ground even if its done ironically it ceases to be funny now its just being a bully
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think its the implication that whatever comes as a suffix to trans wont have anything to do with nonbinary identities
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,from httpwwwtransstudentorgasterisk there is nothing inherently problematic with the asterisk but its often applied in inaccessible binarist and transmisogynist ways it is unnecessary and should not be used
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think its more that the star was included to be inclusive of nb people but its actually less inclusive since it implies theyre not included in trans in the first place in other words its like saying trans and nb people rather than just having nb included under trans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ahh okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks for the info i wonder how long a time period all this took place
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a year or so not very long
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why the fuck should i give a shit does electricity being invented by fucking edison make everyone else wannabe whites when they use it how does one invent electricity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,asians are statistically shorter both in height and in endowment than white men asians always try to be like white people because they want to fit in and shed their primitive culture oh my gooooooood
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its an older slur sir but it checks out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just sayin the dude is a poster to raznidentity which is a pretty antiblack asian sub he also gleefully calls folks nigger monkeys elsewhere in the thread there are no heroes in that thread they all suck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no they called me whitey baby
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is basketball a jewish conspiracy now too naismith wasnt even jewish he worked at the ymca several times throughout his career and the sport of basketball spread nationally through the ymca but somehow they feel better thinking it was invented by a jew
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god have you people even taken a look at the rest of the comments at least thirty different users have suggested they would physically harm those two girls in the picture roundhouse to the face for both of those little crumb snatchers fly back and beat the shit out of them i would drowned that stealing bitch in soy sauce soysauce is japanese you dumb fuck not even the right part of the continent thats like trying to insult a swede by making a reference to sicilian pasta i mean id be pissed if some kids made off with my belongings but i would never hurt a child even if they were a real brat and those two kids certainly are not brats also i highly doubt this actually happened for two reasons those kids are actually quite well known in that particular part of thailand as they take pictures with tourists for a small fee so trying to steal belongings especially stupid when you are being caught on camera would hurt their reputation even if they were thieves they would not target your girlfriends watch as those are not really that valuable in thailand more likely they would target whatever is your bag also kids just like to touch stuff actually they really love touching new things source i have worked with little kids and they love to grab whatever it is you have with you adorable if it is your keys not so much if it is an expensive phone edit anybody think there is a little bit of a doublestandard here i mean reddit finds it adorable when asian kids steal your stuff but i imagine they would be calling for genocide if those kids were african
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh white oppression
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and then he edits his post to make it look like he never called anyone an asian slur l m a o
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the level of flaming that those poc are doing in that thread is godly ive got half a mind to start putting their quotes on pepes to retaliate against the nazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck your raicst vitrol against both white people and black people ive seen you all over this thread today get a life gook in reply to falltotheground on w h i t e y at utc uniquememerinos wrote fuck your raicst vitrol against both white people and black people ive seen you all over this thread today get a life gook
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the same way columbus invented murica duh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,besides everyone knows ben franklin invented it with his kite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so wrong tesla won that battle so ac current runs through powerlines instead of dc as edison wanted so hes not just a shitlord hes a rbadhistory worthy shitlord
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ironicat
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the type of childish shit that im ashamed i did when i was like someone insults you racially you so insult them back racially its basically a well if you can say it i can too and its fucking dumb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,classic white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,primitive culture didnt the japanese invent video games how the hell is that primitive i mean even if they didnt invent video games they did invent the nes thats pretty notprimitive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now i know what slavery was like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not soon enough
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every time im reminded of this i get irrationally angry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone insults you racially you so insult them back racially but while calling them out for being racist like oh im a well fuck you makes way more internal sense than your racism is unwelcome here ya damn thats a new one on me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,classic white brogressive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah but thats different because its something they like
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually he plans to free us from the memes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres plenty of space on twitter to rant about minor things that make you irrationally angry wait
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair memetics is just a shitty less interesting ripoff of semiotics its not like dawkins is in any way relevant to anything ever outside of like manbaby shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,richard dawkins has been called out by people on r atheism about his twitter feed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,🐍 dont tread on memes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this almost makes up for all of dawkins shittiness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he quickly shits all over it by quoting wilde as if the socialist wilde would put up with his elitist horseshit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a black hispanic indian romani arabic jewish muslim and anarcha‐feminist was teaching a class on martin luther king a known black supremacist before the class begins you must get on your knees and worship martin luther king and accept that he did more for humanity than anybody else including adolf hitler at this moment a brave masculine nordic‐aryan neo‐nazi champion who had over posts on stormfront and understood the necessity of eugenics and fully supported all military decisions made by the nazi régime stood up and held up a canister of zyklon‐b what was this canister used for the arrogant professor smirked quite semitically and smugly replied it was used to kill six million jews you stupid fascist wrong nobody ever died in gas chambers during world war ii if this contained poison and the holocaust as you say happened then we would have found traces of it in the chambers the professor was visibly shaken and dropped her chalk and copy of the talmud she stormed out of the room crying those communist crocodile tears the same tears that communists cry for minorities who would have still been living in caves were it not for the heroic white men of the colonial era when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from hard‐working white men there is no doubt that at this point our professor rosa parks wished she had returned to africa and become more than a sophist regressive left professor she wished so much that she had a gun to shoot herself from embarrassment but she herself had petitioned against them the students applauded and all joined the nazi party that day and accepted donald trump as their lord and savior an eagle named race realism flew into the room and perched atop the american flag and shed a tear on the chalk mein kampf was read several times and god himself showed up and deported all of the illegals from the country the professor lost her tenure and was fired the next day she died from overdosing on marijuana white pride world wide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ill admit i really dont know much about the girl who carried around the mattress kia is all up in arms about false accusations though and every time an ethical reporting nerd asks if theres a source proving le false accusations kia ignores and continues its hate jerk why does it feel like this frontpage post is just slandering a case that they can label as false accusations it seems like anything involving rape that isnt proven beyond a reasonable doubt and clearly of the violent nature reddit jumps to le false accusations defense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rrghi might need to take a break from reddit soonseeing so many fascists so much racism anythingphobia just a complete disregard for basic human decency and empathythen again thats a good chunk of the world at this point it seemsgah i need to go watch some northernlion or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so we can confirm that gameragate is literally nothing to do with video games now yeah the whole thread is a giant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it seems like wherever you get a bagel the only cream cheese applications are basically a layer of cream cheese so thin it doesnt exist or an amount of cream cheese that will clear out a dairy farm shit is weird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did anybody else watch ceo last night that top was crazy and then that trailer at the end
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone posted the liberal redneck on a different sub he is pretty funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im so tired of this site casual sexism racism homophobia you name it just permeates the majority of reddit i wouldve already left without the fempire etc can anyone recommend an online community thats not entirely shit but also has an appis easy to use on a phone im in imzy but it feels like not quite what im looking for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can we all take a moment to appreciate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just got called an altrighter for not agreeing with communism what the fuck is wrong with this site
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh and fuck pope francis for his whole christians should apologize to gay people for marginalizing them while upholding the deeply homophobic teaching of the rcc and saying things like it is a destructive pretension against the plan of god we are not talking about a mere bill but rather a machination of the father of lies that seeks to confuse and deceive the children of god the movement in many countries to accept samesex marriage is an ideological colonization that we have to be careful about that is trying to destroy the family and now if the union is given the category of marriage and they are given adoption rights there could be children affected every person needs a male father and a female mother that can help them shape their identity at stake are the lives of so many children who will be discriminated against in advance depriving them of the human maturation that god wanted to be given with a father and a mother
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so gross that oculus upvoted a vr waifu loli porn to the frontpage and people getting downvoted for calling it gross pedophile weeb shit which it is brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of reddit sucks this place has close to zero activity rcirclebroke is closed has identity problems and low activity rnegareddit is basically reddit and not in the dae both sides are right and wrong sense but on a literal sense its just another reactionary shithole at this point with commies somehow tech subs are full of people more tech illiterate than my cat with great delusions of grandeur to the point of them cannot even read the settings menu and if the do somehow find it you get a it should have been the default that way like bitch all you had to do is press a button if you had to recompile the kernel because of some obscure reason i would understand this is just pressing a fucking button rwarframe is just shitty memes and negativity i really want to pull a dae perfect circle venn diagram about rtechnology rlinux rthedonald rkotakuinaction and rpcmasterrace but is not even worth my time also the entire antiwindows drama is fucking hilarious because linux users had the perfect reasons to push linux and snag at the very fucking least of the market with great ease all they had to do was not be shitheads and subtly mention the alternatives and they fucked up that to the point they lost users
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i got a new company car ford fiesta its pretty dope only exception is that there is this gigantic hole near the handbrake where my key has fallen into and it took me more then half a hour to fish my keys out of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so ive been exploring islam lately and i find it somewhat amusing that the more i explore my identity the more hated minorities i seem to join im like a living breathing trumpette nightmare
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you should make the professor an anarchafeminist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fin
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought the neo nazi was attempting to gas everyone but i guess the pasta would end too soon also did the professor kill herself twice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its disturbingly amazing what you see when you start to pay attention to this stuff 😢
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can always remove excess but its usually more to get more cream cheese so theres a clear better scenario here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just want either a cream cheese thats not cold and bricklike or hotter bagels so my dang cheese will spread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,id recommend imzy but besides themnot much really thats the world we live in sadly it depresses me too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the rise of the far right have also brought in some far left dummies and this is coming from a socialist a couple days ago i saw a leftist defend torture on rlatestagecapitalism because muh realism edit that all being said it looks like youre being shit on for having bad arguments lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no you said communism can never work because of human nature and its a joke the human nature is literally a meme at this point you played yourself i did not see you get called an altrighter but you cannot eradicate racism and misogyny and transphobiahomophobia without also eradicating class divisions that is intersectionality for you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess the fact of the matter is that some religions are irreconciliable with lgbt rights
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,negareddit is reactionary it ranges liberalleaning moderate to downright leftist in my experience my only real gripe is some really petty shit makes it up there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,delete that gendered slur would ya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those are cute cars i was looking into one of those but settled on the slightly larger kia forte the ford hatchbacks had odd visibility issues out the back window because of the back seat headrests what color is it ford has the best blue imho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you could put duct tape or something covering the hole maybe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so ive been exploring islam lately can i ask why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tout est accompli
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you lost shitbag fuck off back to rthedonald
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was told by an individualist postleft to be fair anarchist say hed kill other socialists if they ever infringed on his liberty the fuck man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont had any reason to have good arguments on fucking negareddit where i go to evade and laugh this kind of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look again also its a meme because you all made it a meme even when i was new to the theme i voice my opinion and it seemed you all heard it a hundred times wonder why humans are greedy love screwing over each other and are toxicy competitive by default that is human nature communism would work on a setting like star trek where humanity transcended such bullshit but not now this its a meme so its invalid bullshit just reeks of pcmr rhetoric computers are hard is a meme therefore its invalid even when most people dont want to troubleshoot half of the basic problems everyone is eventually going to have plus building the damn thing if you seriously think because human nature its an invalid reason i want you to look at rthedonald and tell me with a straight face these people are apt to run a communism country and no well they wouldnt be the ones being the leaders is not an excuse because inherently on a communism government everyone is equal therefore you will eventually get one of those guys in charge
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i rlly rlly like ur flair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it went off the deep left end now at this point i can pull a dae horseshoe and say they are also building a commie echo chamber more so because hilariously of the submissions uploaded the past days are below upvoted leftie reactionaries if you must they even use the same rhetoric
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theduckface brigading comments about kias
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a white fiesta i cant agree more the blue colored once are trully the most beautifull compared to there other colored colleges i havent experienced any issue with the back window i do think the kia forte is better i occasionly feel very cramped in the fiesta
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i am still looking for the right thing that fits i want it to blend in and not be something i am going to slightly dislike every day thanks for your input maybe if everything fails i will just tape it shut fron the inside
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive felt oddly drawn to it for reasons i cant fully explain so ive been exploring the theology and reading the quran and a lot of it makes sense to me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you evoked the style of those bastards so well i had to doublecheck the username
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh wow thats even worse because thats a vague as shit statement especially under individualist philosophy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i havent even found out what postleft means
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you want to be smug and roll around in your privilege and use that to denigrate communism default reddit eats that shit up
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what you have a racist uncles lack of knowledge of communism classless literally everyone is equal in all ways i have also heard that black people are violent savages a million times i can dismiss it out of hand marx was a renowned philosopher historian the father of sociology economic theorist you are fucking clueless capital is about human nature if you had a tiny inkling of what the hell youre talking about you would know that for the vast majority of humanitys existence people lived in primitive communist lifestyles this level of ignorance is frankly quite ridiculous human nature is defined by nature itself remove the conditions of capitalism and greed is disincentivized of course communism would require a transitional stage that is what marx said himself i would support an anarchist revolution though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,communism would work on a setting like star trek where humanity transcended such bullshit but not now havent there been a few episodes and films where its pointed out that the federation isnt as superior and enlightened compared to past eras of humanity as theyd like to think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,o ty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sorry that it reminds you liberals are always a few decades late to the progress party
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol what happened to my safe space
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive felt oddly drawn to it for reasons i cant fully explain thats fair reading the quran and a lot of it makes sense to me im not too familiar with it what kind of things are making sense and have you checked out the hadiths yet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i get out of the pool i dont want water in my face when im eating at the table with the negareddit kool kids
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would support an anarchist revolution though attaboi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would support an anarchist revolution though good luck with that i stand by my words that communism is for people with nothing left to lose and i would support an anarchist revolution just reinforces that belief the current system is bad because i lost therefore we play by my rules now where i win if you stopped using alt reich rebuttals you may grab my attention but as it stands on dismissing every opposing opinion as ignorant or like some people a shill i doubt you are going to do anything else also nice insta downvotes on everything every single time i oppose commies i see reading so much about rthedonald taught you all well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry that it reminds you communists are in the wrong room for the progress party wait fuck im a liberal or a conservative make up yer mind you commies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im going to check out the hadiths and honestly its too early to really say beyond i agree with the general sentiments ive read so far and talked about aspects of it with friends of mine who are muslim its an odd feeling to say the least but one ill at least give a chance to explore
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well you sure seem to like the pool more go to runpopularopinions if you want to get pats on the back for being reactionary
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh please youre the one who thinks that because capitalism benefits you its the best system you reek of privilege thanks for down voting me for calling out your misogynistic slur in your other comment in this thread your nature might be to greedily exploit others certainly not mine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mhm teleport you to and youll be rationalizing slavery because muh golden mean and human nature wed still have jim crow if it wasnt for communists us conservatives are liberals by the way except for the extreme fascist ones you really do know nothing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cool thanks for the answers oh btw this just crossed my mind is there a sect that you identify with the most
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bruh i go to negareddit and circlebroke to get away from reactionaries then again the labeling point dodging with it was already addressed the broken mental gymnastics are hilarious its just like im talking to a donald user you only need to call me a cuck and we got the whole bingo card good to go
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i want to know how communism would give us all the same living conditions we have right now considering most companies were fighting for better internet speeds better hardware more efficient ways to produce electricity more efficient vehicles more efficient medicines better healthcare cheaper and better medicines more sturdy houses all in the name of selling more than the other idiots what incentive does everyone have on a communist country nothing that is why good will projects like open source anything never gets anywhere even the linux kernel is mainly developed by companies pouring money into it because they need it stable in the name of capitalism most open source nonfunded projects are understaffed nonpaid ridden with bugs and lagging years behind proprietary alternatives because nobody wants to do the hard work without getting a good pay meanwhile proprietary solutions are fucking around with vr hololens neural networks and self learning ai all in the name of capitalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i probably would then again its current year then again this whole you all know nothing sheeple shnick gets old fast
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so far i havent explored enough to fully say which sect but shia does call to me from what ive been reading on it this has all been very recent though so things may change given time im still in that new scary and excited stage haha
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,want to know how communism would give us all the same living conditions we have right now whose living conditions are you talking about are you talking about middle easterners whose homes are being destroyed by american drones are you talking about pakistanis working in click farms are you talking about donald trump are you talking about one of the people who starve to death annually considering most companies were fighting for better internet speeds better hardware more efficient ways to produce electricity more efficient vehicles more efficient medicines better healthcare cheaper and better medicines more sturdy houses food companies arent fighting to get free food to people who are homeless mcdonalds do not fight to end malnutrition in america cigarette companies do not fight to end tobacco addiction military hardware companies do not fight to end war in the middle east what incentive does everyone have on a communist country what incentive do you have to keep your house clean do you get paid if you go to a friends place for dinner what incentive do you have to offer to wash the dishes once you are done eating what incentive do you have to not litter in the streets what incentive do you have to be polite to a store clerk for some of us being a good person who lives in a decent society is incentive if you only do things because of the incentive of capital reward then i feel extremely sorry for you not just because such a life sounds horrible but because your parents teachers and other social influences failed you so horribly most open source nonfunded projects are understaffed nonpaid ridden with bugs and lagging years behind proprietary alternatives because nobody wants to do the hard work without getting a good pay so basically in a capitalist system you have to rely on the capitalist system to succeed therefore capitalism is best and we should keep it your logic is terrible and assumes the perpetuity of the dominant system in order to justify maintaining the dominant system meanwhile proprietary solutions are fucking around with vr hololens neural networks and self learning ai all in the name of capitalism do you have any idea how much more stuff gets put through by government working for the greater good of humanity rather than by companies the thing about companies is that they have to make a profit so if an idea has a lot of potential but will be expensive take a long time to achieve and have very little pay off companies are unlikely to fund it that is why things like the computer and the internet get invented by government departments or nonprofit ngos they can take that risk because they are not expected to make the same return on investment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit dude youre fucking clueless of course goodwill projects fail in a capitalist society that is the nature of capitalism there would be no internet if the state had not stepped in and made it profitable first there would be no satellites remember how the ussr was first to space
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most open source nonfunded projects are understaffed nonpaid ridden with bugs and lagging years behind proprietary alternatives because nobody wants to do the hard work without getting a good pay name open source projects that are bugridden lagging years behind because im pretty sure youre making stuff up and the funny thing is that you use mpv which is an open source media player and i doubt any corporations invest any money in it yet is unmatched in flexibility customization stability and video quality and vimemacs two of the most customizable efficient text editors ever and my vim setup with plugins is like smaller than the minimum requirement for visual studio it is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cool you love them reactionary memes too the whole human nature thoooo gets old fast considering it was debunked back in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you talking about middle easterners whose homes are being destroyed by american drones if america wanted to destroy middle easterners homes they could do it a lot cheaper without using drones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah no shit and we wouldnt need firefighters if it wasnt because fire exists how the shit do you want to make people shift over to your society find a genie lamp and wish that a totalitarian communist empire where capitalism is banned good luck bro
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,debunked yet its still alive and glaring if you look outside the window fixing capitalisms bullshit is doable but hard communism is a pipe dream you are free to try through
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so wait the war in the middle east and the loss of life and lifetsyle by people who live in the middle east isnt a relevant to a discussion of the living conditions have right now because america could be killing and destroying livelihoods more effectively is that what your saying or are you saying the loss of life and livelihood in the middle east isnt bad because it isnt americas primary goal and is merely collateral damage or is there some cognizant point you are making at the moment your response just comes across as the kneejerk reaction of someone desperately trying to avoid cognitive dissonance i assume that is actually what it is but i figured id double check
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were going to take the property of course you probably think that means we all want to use your toothbrush lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hahahaha spoken like a true bourgie go exploit some more workers you are rationalizing actual theft i dont expect you to know what revolutionary catalonia was or the successes of the ussr or cuba etc were go exploit more third world workers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good luck with that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the thing that bothers me is the lack of outreach on our part to try to patch up things between us and them ah the quickest way to the heart of the privileged saying its the minoritys fault
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in the end dealing with police is something most people will eventually have to do and thats terrible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in the end dealing with police is something most people will eventually have to do so its best that we educate police about us as much as possibleto not allow her into the venue in uniform was an affront to diversity at utc alexiscm replied to this is an interesting topic by far on one hand i understand not accepting police in general because of how for the most part police lack respect towards the lgbt community this is especially apparent for those of us that are trans being leery towards police is going to happen the thing that bothers me is the lack of outreach on our part to try to patch up things between us and them in the end dealing with police is something most people will eventually have to do so its best that we educate police about us as much as possible for the folks at that event to bar her entry is wrong she could be the one person we need to start or continue building a relationship with the police in that city but the people working that venue ruined that chance to not allow her into the venue in uniform was an affront to diversity edit fixing late night typos httpiimgurcomvmgrdztpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh didnt you hear victimblaming is all the rage now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on a starterpack on how white people have an easier time with the police looney blm supporters who do not like facing punishment for breaking the law make up narratives like these they think cops are racist for shooting criminals if the criminal happens to be black in reply to nowandlater on can someone explain to me what this starter pack is trying to say whatever it is doesnt seem funny edit ok i get it now at utc bajeena wrote looney blm supporters who do not like facing punishment for breaking the law make up narratives like these they think cops are racist for shooting criminals if the criminal happens to be black httpiimgurcompzinqqcpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you browse the trump sub youll see that these guys always talk about wearing a maga hat or trump shirt to trigger liberals these are attention starved losers who crave the attention to feel relevant they see minorities being oppressed and finally the conversation starts to notice them and what do these neonazis do they try to get people outraged at them so they can cry victim and shift the conversation back to but what about white males
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wearing a trump shirt — not necessarily antagonizing specifically wearing a trump shirt every day to a class about patriarchy — obvious intent is obvious this is not a hard connection to make
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,except if i disagree with your point of view will call you an sjw feminazi bully you dox you make your life hell until you kill yourself is that roughly how that sentence is supposed to play out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae black people arent people is a defendable opinion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont listen engage or argue with fascist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you support a blossoming protofascist you have willingly foregone your right to have your viewpoint considered on the same level other opinions are you are supporting a man who holds truth in no regard and will say pretty much anything to swing the public opinion in his preferred direction he has profaned the sanctity of organized discourse and has demonstrated quite nicely that he has no respect for others povs unless they support his own in some manner fascism is not something you fight by allowing it to take the stage and speak just my two cents i feel like that one meme where it goes like the wise man spoke there is literally no difference between good and bad things you ableism is pretty applicable for the whole people should be able to listen to different points of view bit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on what fucking planet are either one better for arguing with a trump supporter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty sure arguing with trump supporters has been gradually degrading my mind idk if that qualifies as better for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol if i ever see some male with a trump shirt im calling them a fucking fascist good night white pride
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,too much liberalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this ignores that the altreich thrives on bad faith arguments that makes any attempt at communicating impossible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edit looks like this guy fabricated the story to antagonize trollx
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tolerating intolerance builds intolerance
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,possible trigger warning for violence maybe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its these people who are the first to defend the fascists rights to free speech but complain about blm inconveniencing people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wearing a trump shirt is not antagonizing people should be able to listen to different points of view engage with them and argue against them in the end both people will be better for it at utc toadthegoat replied to to be fair wearing a trump shirt is not antagonizing people should be able to listen to different points of view engage with them and argue against them in the end both people will be better for it httpiimgurcomrhveofrpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wearing a trump shirt may not be deliberately antagonistic but i dont give a fuck they probably didnt think the swastika was antagonistic in the either you wear that shit you support fascism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uh no hillary was the big government socialist let me remind you that nazism is national socialism not national fascism hillary was politically much closer to nsdap than anything in americas right wing period unless you think hes literally hitler because hes a fing white male
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bobityben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look out we got a badass over here wait what were you expecting them to elicit violence towards you sorry mate we aint the fucking fash we wait till its called self defence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those nazis have been arguing in bad faith long before putin realized they were useful to manipulate us politics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,left wing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i can sell you better tin foil for your headgear
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the swastika did not originate in fascism though great yeah heard it a million times by redditeurs its not fucking relevant to the conversation at hand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i legit burst out laughing well done dinobenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nazism was fascism i dont give a fuck what the nazis called themselves if they called themselves the jewloving few it wouldnt make that true either you cant just declare yourself something and it becomes so edit also hilary is so far from socialist its not even funny pick up a book you clown
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and the democratic peoples republic of korea is really democratic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is a sad stable that produced such a horseshit theory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it must hurt to wake up every morning and be you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,socialism and national socialism are directly at odds to each other thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fascists using leftist and working class buzzwords to manipulate the common people is a favorite fascist propaganda tactic you took it at face value without any critical thought or objectivity ignorance like this perpetuates and enables fascism hillary is the epitome of liberalism not socialism at all socialism government run services in capitalist society her ideology and policy did not advocate for democratic workercommunity owned means of production and elimination of private propertyclass divisions liberalism and socialism are mutually exclusive ideologies both in practice and ethics fascism favors state capitalist enterprise and inequality hitler was no socialist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao you need to read a book about the rise of hitler and the nazi party im not even going to downvote you because this is reddit gold have an upvote
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,are you actually this stupid i hope so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,k
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is one of the best
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant see the third panel can someone post a web link so i can see the whole thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that thread is the outhouse that just wont stop giving isnt it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why is being a straight up nazi hilarious again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae how clever i am i make jew joak hurrrrrr
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now every other person is flipping out about not being able to use the fslur because frozen peaches
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hello thing people have been saying about jews at least since the medieval era
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae jews are money grubbing lets just ignore centuries of white european imperialism capitalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quick ask it something smart like why are we here what made the universe or why do jews steal all the money in reply to mastigia on but is it selfaware at utc immasuckyodick wrote quick ask it something smart like why are we here what made the universe or why do jews steal all the money httpiimgurcomwxpetmwpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty sure the old testament has a line about that joke being too unoriginal
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,da jooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooows someone tell herbert moon to go home
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why are white people so ugly and stupid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the worst image link for this quote but idgaf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nazi germany called it wants its joke back
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least with an outhouse most of the shit stays in the pit with reddit the shit flows like water after a dam breaks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its worse the flow after a breach would slow and maybe even stop reddit has constructed a shitworks to keep it flowing at all times
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like a septic tank that keeps exploding raining shit and piss down upon the poor and unsuspecting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if people who propose eugenics werent allowed to reproduce
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well itd cut down on the number of redditors wait whats that you think youd make the cut
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bonus yes they do and occupational health and safety laws are fighting natural selection the population as a whole is getting dumber people in industrial work literally deserve to die on the job because they are automatically not smart enough to exist in my world now lets go aside and complain that women arent dying on the job enough because thats the real privlege
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate idiocracy it is still providing validation for shit like this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of the people who say this stupid shit probably wouldnt have been born because at least one of their parents grands or greats would be considered stupid in the past
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when you get down to it these people would all approve as long as they didnt get culled so everyone dumber than them they themselves are the standard for who is smart enough to live or die what an incredibly selfcentered empathydevoid point of view blech
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someones been reading hottest takes of the
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what makes him think hell be one of the bright ones that should be allowed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stupid people shouldnt be allowed to reproduce at utc kushglo replied to stupid people shouldnt be allowed to reproduce
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only population control id approve of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its always best to lead by example
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what was his name again holter rittler
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the premise was intended to be humorous commentary on the nice guy complaint what happens if all the high school assholes really were getting the girls to the point where the entire world was basically a grade locker room but the movies view on genetics shouldnt be taken any more seriously than its view on cryogenics botony or civil engineering its a satiric take on prideful knownothingness not a serious recommendation for a human breeding program
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like that old i have a iq fedorawearing redditor stereotype is being manifested before our eyes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh white exceptionalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,richard spencer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,weird mustache though do you think the lurkers get the joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think that mentioning idiocracy in any debate about humanitys future should be qualified as an instalosing move
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh geez when i first saw this movie and he watered the ground instead of putting gatorade on it i was like welp hes dead its going to take years for that soil to recover movie magic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit loves giving fascism a wide berth i hate these arse holes they allow it because it doesnt affect the majority of the white populous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah not touching this one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats the point do you want to ruin his career just because you believe in a different ideology looks at fada well well
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did any of these people stop to think why someones career might be negatively affected by being outed as a trump supporter or is this one of those circumstances where the party of personal responsibility blames liberals for their problems
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one plays the you wanna make their life difficult just because they disagree card for people who have good ideology its always the defense of some evil douchebag just sayin
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you want to ruin his career just because you believe in a different ideology youre just being an asshole at utc johnarata replied to whats the point do you want to ruin his career just because you believe in a different ideology youre just being an asshole theres no reason for the site
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they give fascists a wide berth but leftistsfeministsetc had better shut the fuck up if they know whats good for them tells you who theyre really on the side of if you catch my drift
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when even uvorpaleskimo is speechless you done goofed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you suppress free speech you become fascist we used to bomb fascists it was once illegal to to support fascism in the us no one ever complains about that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,due to the recent rise in donald trump i worry that too much time has past since the last time fascism went unchecked to remember how fucking terrible it was
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those are not antifascists they are using lungs to inhale and exhale who else did that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is peak rshitliberalssay as well fascism is inherently violent but that doesnt mean violence is inherently fascist thats too much nuance for liberals i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,horseshoe theory intensifies edit spelling
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those are not antifascists they are using violence to stop fascist who else did that yes fascist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit defending nazis again under the guise of free speech neat e how much you wanna bet these are white christian heteronormative men who have nothing to fear from nazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me my grandfather fought fascists in reddit hes a hero me i fought them today reddit youre worse than them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this stage reddit is indistinguishable from breitbart breathlessly running with the latest article about the thuggish left with the comments being the agonizingly predictable i thought they were tolerant wtf and here we see the violence that is really inside liberals
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly supporters of valuable discussion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwxcydanffrw always appropriate but now more than usual
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,something something dril good and bad things tweet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah yes good old reddit falling over themselves to defend nazis while ranting about blm being a terrorist organization
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,somehow i doubt this guy is as accepting of blm protesters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uh gee i mean multiple countries are bombing isis right now doesnt that kinda make it so that those countries are using violence to stop freedom of speech and i mean america helped the allies repress the nazis guess we violently repressed their freedom of speech too huh gee i guess that makes america the real nazi and isis terrorist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,by that logic the soviet union was fascist hmm its almost as if violence or censorship as they would call it isnt inherently left or rightwing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those are not antifascists they are using violence to stop speech who else did that at utc wrestlingisgood replied to those are not antifascists they are using violence to stop speech who else did that the nazi speech isnt pleasant but violence isnt the answer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hitler drove a car hitler had hair hitler wore pants remind of of anyone lieberals hillary hussein clinton
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why did it stop being illegal to openly support fascism did the americans think it would make the fascists calm down or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was once illegal to to support fascism in the us it should still be illegal failing that antifa should be given free reign to do what it needs to do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what a creepy looking fucker how appropriate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh freeze peach intensifies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would love to know the origin of that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i learned at a blm rally in fact the one in minneapolis targeted by white supremacists that a layer of laminated magazines like checkout line tabloids does wonders to stop knives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit always picking the wrong side always ignoring the facts as they exist in reality always coming to the defense of those who deserve it the least
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont doubt you and i dont trust the media coverage of this event which was deeply biased towards the fascists but is there any media outlet that reported on the facts as you have stated them it would just be nice to read another account of what actually happened and be able to forward a journalistic account to people who are sympathizing with the fascists rather than a reddit comment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey another srser in sac cool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you were there shit im sorry about your friends im sad our people were the ones who got stuck but im honestly not surprised antifa has been taking a majority of the hits in the past few years we seriously need to arm ourselves the media will always paint us as the aggressor and defend the fash white liberals will always defend the fash the fash will always violently attack us antifa is among the few groups trying to keep them in check we need to start acting like a militia and seriously arming ourselves or something i dont know i dont know what we need we just cant let them keep growing im just scared that this is going to happen again and again fascism is growing exponentially in the us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it really seems like a lot of young people today feel like the who nazism thing was blown out of proportion from the end of nazis were portrayed as goto villains in a lot of media and it was generally agreed throughout society that nazism represented absolute evil now that were a few generations removed from nazi germany and many of the people who actually lived through their horrors are dying off a lot of younger people not only lack any kind of personal connection to the victims but also see the portrayal of nazism as some kind of overthetop exaggeration things like holocaust denial that just years ago was only taken seriously by an extremist fringe is now increasing in popularity in many parts of the right wing world and even in some of the more paranoid reactionary parts of the left its really frightening to encounter seemingly friendly reasonable teenagers from perfectly normal families spouting off claims originating from the likes of david irving or ernst zündel as though they were just interesting history factoids
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,getting a lot of mileage out of this lately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its as if liberals dont actually know what fascism is they accuse the left of just throwing the word fascist around as an insult when theyre the ones doing it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and capitalism is peaceful yep no deaths there no sir
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually did you know that both sides are just as bad and indistinguishable from each other smug
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hitler with the penrose arm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more than nothing to fear from them im sure more than a few of them are good friends with fascists and id put good money on some of them being cardcarrying little shitlers themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the soldiers landing in normandy and defending stalingrad are the real fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fascists are only bad when i dont agree with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at this point reddit mainly exists as an extension of the comments sections of various radicalized right wing news outlets with less moderation and less room for dissent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought they were tolerant wtf why arent they tolerant to my intolerance theyre the real facists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the soviet union was a totalitarian dictatorship i dont see why you feel the need to defend that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a few years after wwii ended however bans still exist in some countries like france russia germany and austria etc the german american bund nazi us party was dissolved in due to efforts by the house committee on unamerican activities hcuaa courts found the first amendment overturned what were deemed temporary measures during wwii the hcuaa moved its sights to communism which was seen as a bigger threat in the american nazi party was founded and allowed to stay in existence into the after that the fragmented neonazi groups survived by challenging attempts to hinder them in court through funds from white supremacist organisations oddly enough groups like the black panthers never had similar experience in using the amendment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cryptofascists in the government became more comfortable with exercising their power and influence
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think we can all count the year of the death of david bowie and the rise of the all feeeeeemale ghostbusters movie including shudder a fat woman and a black woman who dont make my peen hard as the true commencement of white male genocide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its from an httpsenwikipediaorgwikiitojunji manga i believe just guessing from the art style i might be wrong in the original version of the image hes saying dude let me in im a fairy dont you believe in fairies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i learned this from jojo great way to fight a timestopping knife throwing vampire who killed your grand grand grand father
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good advice i really dont want to be stabbed by a nazi but i also really dont want them standing uncontested at city freaking hall you know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,national geographic does wonders its like fucking body armor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now i have use for all those free magazine subscriptions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good good now i know what to tell people when im buying my checkout line tabloids
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like after that one blm march where a few people were shot by white supremacists the white supremacists literally posted a video of them driving to the rally with handguns saying blatantly racist shit clearly knowing theyre going to provoke a fight they get to the rally and start calling people niggers and dindunuffins they get told to fuck off someone throws a punch and chases the racists away the racists shoot like people and reddit still says that blm provoked the violence im lgbt not a poc but if someone comes into my neighborhood calling me a faggot they can expect to be punched in the throat i dont care what your precious constitution says talk shit get hit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god that sub has been absolutely awful i mean its usually bad but i cant stand reading the comments on articles about this issue
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im nearby lots of great groups in sac
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to me it felt a bit set up every one of them rallies ive gone to in sac the cops aint never let us near one another
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im just scared that this is going to happen again and again fascism is growing exponentially in the us no fucking kidding i have seen two separate incidents at the bus station and on the bus where fucking fascists have just started harassing innocent muslims minding their own business telling them they couldnt wear certain clothes or they couldnt speak their own language together and i live in a smallass city like maybe thousand residents and am rarely using the bus i cant even imagine how much of this shit is going on in places and at times when im not around to see it happening this is on the head of donald j trump fucking fascist supreme and he needs to lose the election and lose it bad in november so these fucks can know that america doesnt give a goddamned dime for their shit im talking i want to see a state blowout for clinton like happened in and i dont even like clinton but i just fucking hate trump so much i want him to lose like a rock swims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hell its right in the name antifascists cant be fascists because theyre by definition opposed to fascism that is unless anti has joined cis and trans on the reddit list of fake prefixes invented by sjws
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is perfect
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a dril tweet for that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fash we must exterminate the jews antifa eat pavement nazi fuck liberal i cant tell you two apart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,le truth is in le middle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no doubt op is a trumpet a couple are brand new accounts couple more are drama and tia trolls im sure theres a nazi or two in there knowing this godforsaken site
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how dare they violate the nazis freezepeach
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and even if i disagree well who am i to say anything just opinions bro
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive installed a comment blocker and let me tell you it works wonders
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah they routinely butchered actual leftists the ussr wasnt fascist but fuck the ussr antirevolutionaries if ive ever seen them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yare yare daze
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just gotta stuff em in your shirt jacket pants sleeves oh and hat just to be safe you never know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh thats a baseball
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,verbal harassment isnt even a first amendment issue
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even a blog post from an attendee with a fuller description of the days events would be something im interested in to counter the official narrative thanks for looking anyway and keep up the good fight
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually this is close to what i was looking for the obvious bias of the websites name isunfortunate at least for my purposes because it will be dismissed out of hand even by people who might otherwise be persuadeable based on the name alone also the only video showing the confrontation the first one appears to show an antifa protester knocking someone out with a pipe im guessing hes antifa based on the handkerchief over his face but the article youve posted does seem to corroborate anicechickens account overall stating their event was intended to be at the california capitol building in sacramento with antifa stepping up to confront the event right away the elected officials inside decided to retreat into the basement of the building for fear of confrontation and at was called for the first time with injuries that would need hospital transport bricks were throne baseball bats flew and fists were in the air as a roaming street battle ensued police came in riot gear to disperse the crowd using less lethal weapons on protesters engaged in confrontations with trad youth organizers the event escalated when the nationalist side stabbed antifascist protesters including an elderly woman who was posing no threat six antifascist protesters were stabbed by the fascist block a show unimaginable cruelty from a group of neonazis who knew they were on the losing side
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ironically the other day a redditeur called me a fascist for using cis in a post
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bbbut my precious horseshoe theory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its amazing how rather than wrapping their minds around the idea that political thought is multidimensional they cling to the notion that it is still one dimensional just with a big bend in that dimension
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre ok i guess personally i prefer comedic exaggeration
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,clearly neville chamberlain was the lesser of the two evils it was churchill who was the real bad guy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how does it work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a reason their system is often described as state capitalist rather than giving control over the means of production to the workers the state took control the state was run by party elites not by workers or the people in any real sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muda muda muda muda mudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamudamuda muuuuuudaaaaaaaaaaa
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpsstorifycomdoniellepthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetrut its also really dismissed the same as the first probably but im getting so much nazi loving bs in my inbox thought id come back with some more
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive had somebody call me a fascist commie on here before
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually thats what pat buchanan wants us to believe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh theres like a bunch of apps for chrome i have a youtube comment blocker and httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailshutupoklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfimhlen which blocks comments across the board
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,indeed in theory they were supposed to eventually turn that power over to the workers but in reality they just became the new bourgeoisie and if you know anything about the bourgeoisie they dont give their power up willingly fuck the bourgeoisie fuck the ussr
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraoraora

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay tell me about males paying child support reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ahem jordan legalized sodomy before texas did
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddot its always the womans fault always
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if some cop decides to go on a shooting spree in his town and he gets shot well gosh he needs to take responsibility for that it was his decision to live in a country where cops go around summarily executing people and he would have decided to take a walk outside
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,will you please think about actual problems in third world countries oh an actual problem well its her own fault
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on a woman being held captive by her husband in jordan she has to accept some personal responsibility at some point she chose to marry this person and have a kid and leave a country where she unquestionably has more rights than where she is now in reply to limberine on shes pregnant her husband will be very motivated to keep her and the baby in the country leaving will be dangerous you clearly have zero sympathy for her but the fact remains that she will be safer if someone helps her hopefully her father will be able to work something out at utc divergingapproach wrote she has to accept some personal responsibility at some point she chose to marry this person and have a kid and leave a country where she unquestionably has more rights than where she is now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now see thats totally different because ethics in gaming journalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats because anglo americans are savages we need to stop sending texas aid from the federal government theyd only embezzle it piss it away on violence and use it to spread hateful fundamentalist propaganda why support a regime that hates gay people we just want to protect gay people and women here we should be treating these white animals like what they are and going to war with them texan isnt a race ok so it isnt racist end immigration from texas id say bomb them back into the stone age but lol it wouldnt change a goddamn thing s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this but unironically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i want to throw a stripper party for my all male tech firm but i cant hire women because they get all preggers and thats expensive in reply to grievre on are there any legal implications associated with throwing a stripper party at my how many employees do you have because if the answer is more than say three you need to hire some women stat this is not meant to be legal advice at utc fjfilin wrote as of now we have people excluding myself officially i hire the best candidate for the job unofficially unfortunately california is one of the only states that requires paid maternity leave for female employees making female employees quite a risk for smaller businesses
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you cant afford to payprovide benefits to your employees the free market has decided that you are weak and deserve to go out of business
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,removed for violation of the submission rules

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,found this throwback while digging for content for riamnotracistbut come join us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what does this person think transphobia is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh okay i thought you were at first mainly because of the incredibly transphobic thing you just said but you claim not to be so i guess that cancels out every transphobic thing you might say or do oh wait no it doesnt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,denying the existence of trans women is transphobic you flaming piece of shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not racist bbbbutttt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,transwomen are not real women im not transphobic you can only pick one of these statements grosshopper i meant to type grasshopper but im leaving it because it seems more accurate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors are not real people im not misanthropic jk i am fuck reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some fucker in there is saying being gay is a mental disorder i want to punch them in the face
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,black people are not real people im not racist sounds horrible when you change the subject too edit i do appreciate a response without cursing and animal cracker crumbs is everyone getting messaged by the same guy thats not at all equivalent to the original statement racism means thinking that there are racial differences or discriminating based on race so thinking that some race is human and some other isnt is by definition racism transphobia means hating transgender people and thinking that transgender women are not women doesnt imply that you hate transgender people if you feel the need to make any distinction youre already part of the problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,translation trans women are only ok if a they please the cispeen b i cant tell they are trans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,has anyone ever seen an unpopular opinion puffin meme that really contained an unpopular opinion and not just sone circlejerk bullshit that gives you easy upvotes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hitler did nothing wrong im not a nazi i had no idea it was that easy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,edit im an old black guy because i think i am this sure is exactly how this works right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,guess the sub
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you cant have it both ways by denying the existence of trans people you void any ability you might have had to define who is and isnt transphobic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not racist buuuut i do acknowledge that as a white man i benefit greatly from systems of oppression and can never fully free myself from unconscious bias only better understand and hope to mitigated its impact
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im not fascist but i truly hate jews and i think they deserve to be slaughtered unotafascist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes you are oh no im not we could do this on stage and get paid for it s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,good responses in there makes me happy 💞
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,transwomen are not real women im not transphobic in reply to datbrony on real women have two x chromosomes does that work wait trans peeps ffs at utc banditqueen wrote i dont care what anyone says transwomen are not real women im not transphobic im just realistic with these labels they can call themselves whatever they want but theyre not actually women edit im an old black guy because i think i am
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hahaha this is a really old post i just saw my own comment in response to it from three years ago oh man good times
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as stupid as it sounds ive had arguments with people who try to weasel out of being called a transphobehomophobe by claiming that it cant possibly be true because phobia means fear and they dont fear us they just think were icky andor depraved perverts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its literally the same as i dont muslims are real americanseuropeans but im not islamophobic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i always think that we can effect great change at the low level the pride parade is a great way of doing a little something to show your support and have some fun one of the best thing we can do to fight injustice at the personal level is to treat people with love acceptance and inclusion so go and have an amazing time
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being straight is the mental disorder everyone should be bi my gay husband yeah im married now may disagree with this though now watch people think im serious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it also still sounds like something the average redditor would agree with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i saw one that said death should be abolished completely and that people who said it gave value to life were delusional they were downvoted to oblivion literally every other uop meme ive seen has been circlejerk bait
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,those always look like flashlights like youre searching for empathy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,smells like asscredit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as soon as i saw this thread i just rolled my eyes and immediately knew it was from another fucking unpopular opinion thread why havent these things just died already
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now look at this ben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mm well technically captchaout
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is on the level of twelve yearolds arguing they can say whatever they want since its a free country
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont see the harm in labeling the obviously different as such as long as there is no discriminating action proceeds to say trans women are fake get the fuck out matey bobityben
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fuck right off dinobenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh fuck off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine if we said trump supporters arent real americans
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is on the level of twelve yearolds redditors arguing they can say whatever they want since its a free country
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,except if it the only reason you have for saying something is it isnt illegal not to then you have no real excuse to say it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uhhuh and if somethings hydrophobic it doesnt necessarily mean its scared of water it means it has an aversion to it same for transphobic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this has got to be my favorite ben image its so charming
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i will proudly admit to being a trumpphobe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,same logic different reaction
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fine ill waste my energy on you calling trans women artificial women is inherently transphobic because it says that were not really what we say we are now go fuck yourself with a cactus you transphobic fuckface

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yikes liberalism of this kind is too pervasive in the fempire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,given how disastrously every attempt to replace modern capitalism has gone i certainly think you can be in favour of social justice and capitalism at utc brogressivedudebro replied to given how disastrously every attempt to replace modern capitalism has gone i certainly think you can be in favour of social justice and capitalism maybe not in a fuck yeah capitalism is perfect way but in a capitalism is currently the least bad option way personally i think that markets are the only way to efficiently allocate resources with our current level of technology and are thus necessary to a modern functional society that doesnt mean that capitalism is necessary though you can have a market economy where businesses are socially owned for example the mondragon corporation and the john lewis partnership are both owned by their workers a freemarket socialist system could potentially function just as well as a freemarket capitalist system but with the side effect of making society far more equitable and socially just
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nowadays black kids with steal spots at harvard from korean kids with steal well okay then

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i knew that awful thread would end up here its almost all pieces of shit defending and or advocating the slaughter of human beings because of muh inanimate objects
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt a major part of the republican party called the tea party after an incident where colonials boarded a ship without the permission of the owner and threw his cargo into the harbour to protest the one tax the government was putting on them americans have no right to complain about protests that end in property damage its in the national dna

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i can only imagine what that guys stance on trumps eo is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but when white ppl do it its okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol no also reddit only gives a shit about asians when they can use asians to shit on another minority
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,murder of africanamericans is okay but punching a nazi is gross
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the person in the picture said in an interview years later they were only firing into the air they were not trying to hurt anyone at all and stated they were glad it they only had property damage and no one was hurt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the boston tea party was a lot more complicated than that it was essentially a result of the british government banning the sale of tea by anyone but the british east india company which was trying to recoup its losses from their attempts to maintain their monopoly on tea the british isles however continued to pay normal prices

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what would happen if reddit told their hilarious jokes outside their safe spaces
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im actually having trouble wrapping my mind around the lack of general awareness one would need to actually just proclaim ownership of a family member it goes beyond the usual contemptible notions of misogyny and sociopathy and into a certain realm of how do i describe this it reminds me of solipsism anyone else its just that sort of belief where the person thinking is more real than the others around them or the most real or perhaps the only real one which dehumanises all others in their brain perhaps theres some kind of psychological disorder that describes this that i dont know about one which dehumanises women to stock which allows them to think like this i have an abnormal brain im neurodiverse so i can think about things weirdly and i can usually at least try to understand more warped ways of thinking this eludes me though but i really wouldnt mind betting it has some basis in some form of solipsism a very narcissistic solipsism its unfortunate that people like this have siblings i feel genuinely sorry for his sister and all the crap shes likely had to endure because of this and this isnt really a fresh cishet idea either ive very much encountered it before and it makes me quite ill no matter whos doing it reducing a real person to stock and involving them in nonconsensual fantasies is supremely fucked up we really do need psychoanalysis for this someone could probably get a paper out of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,imagine feeling this kind of ownership over your sibling

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy male sexualitytm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who says chivalry is dead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well reddit is one of the few social media websites that allows for slight anonmity making it easier for pedophiles to vocalize their thoughts publicly without facing consequnces from people that they know im sure if facebook or twitter wasnt as public you would see so many more pedophiles on those sites
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if one provides a place for child rapists to organize and discuss their completely normal and healthy male sexuality one shouldnt be surprised when one attracts a whole shitload of pedophiles its like field of dreamsif you build it they will come but with child rapists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the idiots that run the site are too lazy and cowardly to kick them out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,males were a mistake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who first said that im missing context sounds really weird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,male
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a guy i know dated a girl who was in grade when he was a senior yeah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or people who are actually or less seriously i remember being and a freshman and thinking theres nothing wrong with that then obviously when i was a senior i would never even consider it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in my school it happened all the time and it was nasty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more like tbh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so the sooner we burn it to the ground the better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,more like the idiots that run the site are edgy sqws who actually like having pedos on here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty sure it was the eskimo person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,happened to my sister the guy is now in jail for statutory rape of another minor piece of trash
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao in senior year we saw freshmen basically the same way as kindergartners

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,accidentally hitting a kid is not the opposite of a fuck up it is a fuck up goddamn reddit taking pleasure in children receiving pain and considering it a privilege if someone gets to hit one sadistic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wtf seeing an annoying child doesnt give you the right to beat them this should be obvious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors are really violent people resorting to physical force at the slightest mishap suburban white males continue to be violent im not saying its genetics but when one group seems to be so violent it does bring up questions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i blame white culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the actual post annoys me too the dad continues to be a massive asshole there is no empathy to the actions of someone whos son was just smacked by a stranger and is bleeding
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least you dont share their skin colour
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the dude felt bad for hitting the kid it was an accident accidents happen redditors acting like its fun to hit the kid is the fucked up part like what the hell why would anyone think its good to assault children

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nice meltdown
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,part of me was hoping this would be one of those twisty lmbos where it actually says srs makes me want to punch somethingbecause it reminds me how prevalent racism and transphobia is but part of me is glad to finally get some delicious white male tears because i havent seen an lmbo in weeks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,apparently he doesnt demean women but he does assign each one a value between to depending on her looks and refers to her as that number rather than her name any pronouns or even something like hot girl which at least acknowledges her as a human to some extent
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for someone who complains about us getting upset he seems really upset dude chill
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes thanks for the astute observation we do hate white men such as yourself
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe if you went into your shitlord hole and stopped being a waste of flesh and air wed stop bothering you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we make fun of alt right who link to daily stormer

ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i started to lose trust when he defended brock turner i mean even the altright kind of hates that guy and we dont even bring him up here that much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had a couple of black friends was going to vote for bernie fought for the gays etc this line made me really think its satire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the only post in their history so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gotta be satire i had a couple of black friends was going to vote for bernie fought for the gays etc not many people sincerely talk like this theyre way more circular about it this is just what we say to make fun of them also laugh about harambe who fucking does that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,poes law man
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant tell if its satire either because people have made accounts just to send me pms and shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its obviously satire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think good satire is the one that you can recognize immediately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a bit too far into im a total piece of shit territory to be believable satire i dunno have you seen reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dang digging out the mesozoic memes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so love me love me love me im a
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its funny that having black friends is considered progressive by some so whats normal excluding all black people from being on your friends list so if you even consider people from a different race as potential friends you are suddenly making social progress having black freinds should be something that happens to most people who arent biased because some of the people they re going to meet will be black
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most likely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,parody not satire satire is when you attack the government and were not the government
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because hes male masculinity so fragile
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hold my earrings its on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a goddamn brd motherfucker do you not see that the fuck is a bird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,deleted
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ur forgetting he had two black friends two
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everyone likes to think theyre progressive its really a common occurence for bigots to describe themselves as such or left leaning
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but real talk how often does your sister actually say that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all men are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can we all agree to stop hating on cheetos like theyre fucking great cornmealy fake cheese covered deliciousness millions of people buy them theyre a great snack food i agree with this proposition
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i cant hear you over all these wages beautiful
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpwwwchestbookbeindeximagesstoriesvirtuemartproductpecheauthonjpg
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the music in the background really sells this your voice work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,three redditors walk into a bar a fascist a cop and a mra and thats just the first one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wouldnt op be punching himself then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or a brick wall
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or all of the above should be easy considering the overlap
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no you dont obviously duh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,child pornography voat is a terrible place dont go there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my favorite genderneutral equivalent is buddyo a perfect mix of sarcasm and dad joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,waiting for this to get posted on srssucks with the title srs brags about ruining lives
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,link
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he also uses a lot of altright racist lingo for someone who barely cares about politics except boilerplate liberalism def not legit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know right i used to have black friends but then srs made fun of redditors and now i dont chimping out dindus if its not satire im curious as to how a person could maintain that level of selfunawareness and still functionally interact with others
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who fucking does that i thought the political ad was funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dicks out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its definitely satire its full of srs meemees and its basically everything we laugh at neatly encapsulated into a post its great
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah a guy called sjwssuck frequently messages me because i post here weird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bad satire is when it comes too close to the thing that its trying to satirize
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what about loweffort shitposting satire thats bad whether or not you can recognize it immediately theres more than just a difference in intent between this and i sexually identify as an attack helicopter the latter is shitty even without considering its targets just because of how little effort and how little nuance there are also im of the opinion that the best satire is the kind that you cant tell immediately but should be obvious by the time you finish it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you have a point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,was a liberal all that shits in the past tense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,were not the government well idk about that since we sjws have taken over everything from academia to the government etc etc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that is not correct
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae onion mot satire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,satire is a genre of literature and sometimes graphic and performing arts in which vices follies abuses and shortcomings are held up to ridicule ideally with the intent of shaming individuals corporations government or society itself into improvement it can be used to attack the government but it doesnt have to be also parody doesnt have to have a purpose beyond making fun of satire is parody attempting to change the object its directed at
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ahem masculinity so fragile rainbow text plskthx
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as long as they dont shove it down my throat by acting all gay infront of me theyre aok i just dont want to have to see hear or even think about them its extremely progressive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is brogress
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rallies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and by fought he means sent good vibes silently
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a black girlfriend do i get to be progressive now too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why is it so hard for a white man to go on the internet and not be oppressed by misandry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who the fuck are these dipshits to the left of
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have actually never heard her say that my point is that when trans people are mocked as hypersensitive bullies which is basically what that joke is i react a little differently than someone whos never known a trans person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im on my lunch break so im okay right now usually tho😰😰😰
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how even in srs we get some notallmenz jfc ppl its a circlejerkqueef edit nevermind just checked their histories theyre not regulars probably wanted to join in our fun but still get mad about the antisawcsm queef
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah ive got coffee im good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thirded i like the mix one with the waffle shapes and the crunchy ones and the little white nub ones delicious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,weird thats weird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ja
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of the first alltime top posts on here are glorious lmbos but the rants are the best deconstructive analysis of srs from the povjust kidding its the most awkward attempt at a not mad rant with a holierthanthou attitude the part in question im not some fat beardmad neckbeard either im pounds bodyfat and i can bench almost pounds so no i have no problem getting girls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and still functionally interact with others then again maybe im presuming too much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dunno and sjwssuck exist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,he does it to a lot of regulars fyi if you want to share a laugh at any pms you receive for posting on here rsrsmailbag
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i agree with uiamtheshitredditsays between srsmailbag and creepypms thats where my imaginary internet points have come from
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i think i agree with this when its too close to reality i cant laugh at it or be annoyed just confused i kept waiting for the punchline with this onei give it a because at least were talking about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or just really transparent lowestcommondenominator potshots with no real effort the opposite end of bad satire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think you are right but we all know how our ol buddy the internet average citizen likes to twist every word into a meaningless buzzword so we probably need an entire book to define it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ideal satire would have you fooled by the end but make you really think about it sleep on it then come back the next day realizing youve been had if you have to read it a second time to really appreciate the nuance its good satire this is obvious satire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,even manufacturing my car steering wheel has srs written right on it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i actually just googled a definition of satire and it turns out it was wrong language changes i guess
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah turns out i was wrong
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,noooo the masculinity cant handle the rainbows
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont mind breeders as long as they act gay in public you dont need to throw all that reproduction stuff in my face
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you hit her
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah im not defending the mockery just pointing out how completely ignorant it is on top of underneath all the malice
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yo remember when cheetos sold bags of only those waffle ones amazing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,biodegradable packing peanuts basically except covered with delightfully artificial powdered cheez nbsp no but seriously theyre corn everything in america is corn
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,belgian cuisine reminds me of the although these are truly objectively hot and need to be defended at all cost
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unlike an unabashed member of the milifandom checkmate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ha thanks at least the and that approach me think so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy hells this is glorious i gotta go digging through more topposts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tru tru idk i chose to enjoy it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im pretty sure thats never been the definition of satire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only when im angry joking aside of course not love her to pieces
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you hit her srspls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not an accomplishment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes those were the best
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think im going to incorporate ham banana into my lexicon
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i stand corrected
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me too i was just confused
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,love her to pieces hmmmmmmmmmm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so i finally found httpswwwredditcomrmenkampf on rall it essentially revolves around replacing any context of manhating or whatever with nazi propaganda to point out the double standards
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,saw some conservative crybabies on facebook whining about the year old transgender wrestler in texas that won undefeated in the girls division queue the same transphobic bullshit but then i read the article and hooooooly shit he was a female to male transgender and literally petitioned the state to compete in the boys division because he felt the testosterone gave him an unfair advantage and they wouldnt let him because icky trans people cant change genders unless i say so still havent been acknowledged when i called them out and their actual not giving a shit about the integrity of competitive sports or whatever the fuck theyre using as an excuse to bash transgender people because they have small minds and are made uncomfortable by things they dont understand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like anime and video games but i cant find any communities surround those two that arent complete libertarian atheist reddit tier shitheads anyway i drove around alone and didnt get extremely anxious at a stop sign great day
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,has this subreddit always been so kind and reasonable i think i was a jerk five years ago sorry i guess i have a lot of growing to do still
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxophruwpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,moonlight won thats great the steve harvey jokes are fun the inevitible black man steal white mans oscar jokes are not on the upside free srs karma to whomever spots that joke first
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hope you had a good weekend srs school starts again tomorrow after a week off for reading week
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i watched finding dory last night and it was awesome i am not sure why a lot of other people thought the movie was average
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,guilty gear is so darn good daisuke bless
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god this is the laziest and least sensible argument yet it crops up all the time wow if you completely change the context to mean something entirely different suddenly its a bad thing i wonder how many of their subscribers are actual nazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess i missed the day in history class where men were systematically exterminated by the ebil feminists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what if the thing you believed was bad would you still believe it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i find the reverse the genders or covert to nazi propaganda meme to be so pointless either original post was offensive as it stands or it wasnt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fucking wow haha i just saw the one on getting compliments from men vs getting them from women they took an issue dealing with sincerity and turned it into an issue dealing with bigotry they arent alike at all these poor assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,arent these the same kind of jackoffs who whinge about professional victims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me as wellit breaks my heart knowing that most anime and game fans are conservative egalitarian anti sjw assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the smash bros melee community is like awesome there are two problems with it male normativity and using the word gay as an insult like its still two thousand and fucking five but those problems really seem to be shrinking as the playerbase is growing up most of us are out of our teens by now so its generally a nice place to be also its an inperson game only so nobodys gonna be too big of a dick and if they are you can easily call them out and everyone will back you up because they overheard the guy that was being a dick
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the jojo community is pretty good so far at least on reddit facebook is cancer no matter the show there should be like a leftist gaming discord
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,report them to the admins if theyre harassing you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey sanders is a good guy who fights against inequality his reddit followers are the shitheads
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,formulaic and used monetized nostalgia i loved it though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was ok not exactly bad but still good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no but the mods say no actual racism so all the racists know not to come there and its okay s and making it okay to write racism somewhere definitely does not encourage racists all over the world knowing that their shitty views are parroted ironically by immature edgelords s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats because its not in history yet the glorious day is still ahead of us
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont really tend to manifest my resentment towards society against any specific individuals who just so happen to be part of it i dont really make jokes about white people or straight people or men in public and i critically reflect on whether what jokes i make may result in oppression or similar negative effects or just forces the butts of the joke to have a strong think about whether the things they believe are good and right or whether theyre being stuckup assholes if a thing i believed turned out to be really bad for some poor souls who in no way deserved it then im reasonably certain i would reconsider in the meantime i have a circle to jerk thats why i am here so the rest of reddit doesnt drive me nuts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats their point theyre offended and theyre confused why nobody else is while being the same people who make offensive jokes and mock other people for having thin skin they just want an excuse to go youre no better than me as if that would somehow absolve them of caring about nobodys feelings but their own they needa get some fucking empathy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah like milo until recently i would have called him a professional harasser because fairs fair right but then he got fired so now hes a professional nothing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if he is such a great guy why did he ruin the election for hillary hillary would have won in the key states if bernie hadnt run hes just like the rest of them too sexist to put their full support behind a woman president
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i did notice parallels
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wasnt disagreeing sorry for miscommunication i was satirically speaking from the voice of that sub continuing your joke of whats context
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no hillary would not have won regardless her mistakes were her own even with bernie supporting he after the primaries it wasnt enough this is what the gop want for democrats to argue amongst themselves and blame progressives so that they turn further right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i am not as good at sarcasm as you are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the only mistake hillary made was being too soft on trump and his idiot followers and if bernie truly supported her he wouldnt have run against her in the first place and taken momentum away from her bernie literally isnt even a democrat and his idiot supporters are sexist neckbeards like trumos except theyre on board with the dude weed lmao train
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its hard to pick up on when you hear so much ridiculous crap from people who arent being sarcastic my ability to pick up sarcasm is screwed up now too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,his idiot supporters on reddit are because theyre redditors most people arent redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hillary is just another neocon with a couple progressive policies sure shed have been better than trump but eating out of a dumpster is better than eating dog shit unfortunately we got the dog shit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,muh neo con
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every time i enter a home with at least one redditor i always play the wheres their anime wall scroll
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemale
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i havent seen one of those since
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh my good people want positive messages to remind them that life is good they must be terrible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a miserable sack of shit so i envy happy people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeemaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all zero times
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,feeeeeeeeeemales let you enter their homes i dont believe you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everytime i enter a home with at least one female i always play the wheres their live love laugh at utc downhillll replied to everytime i enter a home with at least one female i always play the wheres their live love laugh sometimes its a sticker on the wall sometimes its wood words on the window sill sometimes its in a picture frame on an end table
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not my fault nobody in the west can make a better form of entertainment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quark
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,coincidentally that was probably the last time a women let this redditor in their house
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is rape culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,see this is just one of the many reasons its so horrifying that we have a candidate advocating sexual assault people are even more emboldened to make horrifying comments and thats definitely a bad thing for society
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hahaha joking about sexual assault very funny its very sad that an open sexual predator might win the presidency its even worse that people are joking about the victims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought if i clicked there would have been people from original thread calling them out nope just nice little pats on the back and upvotes for their lets sexually assault women lol comment so glad the us republicans voted for a tremendous role model in the primaries great job people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy male sexuality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess this will be the legacy of the trump campaign emboldening men to commit sexual assault
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,costumes are not consent fuckwit its bad enough we need those signs at conventions are they going to need to be put up at every halloween party too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i look forward to reading the news in november and counting how many gropey wads dressed as trump got their asses kicked over halloween weekend
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you dress up as trump im staying feet away from you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,factor in the slutty girl requirement for halloween costumes dress up as trump and grab some pussy in reply to knylok on every costume shop that i went to in canada offered me a trump costume saying it was their most popular item by far i think this halloween will trump all other halloweens at utc boulderdrop wrote factor in the slutty girl requirement for halloween costumes dress up as trump and grab some pussy httpiimgurcomulfditppng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rape culture is a myth it would only be rape culture if you are a rapist and people reward you by voting for you to be president wait
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and emboldening angry whites to physically assault brown people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trump sexually assaulted multiple women nonconsensually ogled beauty pageant contestants by using his power as owner to barge into changing rooms unannounced and straight up violently raped his first wife after ripping out fistfuls of her hair if the stuff about hill is true between the enabler of a sexual predator and an actual sexual predator im gonna say the latter is far worse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,re beauty pageant contestants they were underage at the time hes also been accused of raping a year old girl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shes not worse trump is unambiguously worse i mightve been unclear in my phrasing sry comment has since been deleted but i was replying to someone saying hillary was far worse bc she had allegedly gone after bills assault victims while trump had only said nasty things or something like that and he definitely doesnt stop at just saying things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im starting to think that reddit thinks fascism is kind of cute oh who am i kidding they absolutely do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,actually
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty much yeah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this election wont directly impact me so i can make funny joaks about how people calling trump a fascist are just overreacting snowflakes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this but unironically
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but its really ironic and uses ones instead of exclamation marks so its funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae donald trump a xd lol in reply to saintmax on not completely plenty of third world countries elect tyrant leaders too at utc badshitmayn wrote dae donald trump a xd lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae the pope is xd lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its all a meme to them just wait until trump gets his way and video games start getting censored and weed never gets legalized
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,indeed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this made me smile i cant count the number of times people on this site have claimed that he is just pandering to the right when he takes his stance on weed i hope he megabans it for eternity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seems to enough of them only rightwing speech can get censored though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oui
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,da
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ken
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,はい
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ja
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,m
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,si
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ναι
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hai
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,അതെ
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quēmah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,itchytriggafinganigg goddamit im so jaded with this fuccboi racism i cant even think of anything to say about this shittier username
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae japan is weird
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i honestly cant tell if this is a shitty joke or if he is sincere probably a bit of both
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if youre creeping you deserve to be caught
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats actually exactly why the camera shutter sound cant be silenced on many phones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,excuse me while i go vomit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i automatically assumed the user was talking about taking pictures of peoples dogs which would be far less creepy than what he actually meant
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rhealthymalesexuality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i put my phone on silent that should include media and the camera shutter lest i get caught creeping at utc itchytriggafinganigg replied to every god damn time if i put my phone on silent that should include media and the camera shutter lest i get caught creeping httpiimgurcomankxgihpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fucking hate that stereotype fetishization of an entire culture like that is awful for both sides
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well uploaded to rfunny a month ago of a girl who didnt know her picture was being taken sfw in the comments he said before her hair moved so he took this creeper shot himself so op is a sincere creeper getting upvoted for his bravery
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its pretty much never just a joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae google tracking me to show ads is worse than hitler
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy male ducks and dolphins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats wrong with dolphin reproductive strategy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it would be nice if my camera didnt scare my cats so much that i cant get decent pictures of them but thats such a small thing in a world full of creepy men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you must be new to reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes lots of rape interspecies stuff too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is less creepy than the more obvious photos that are meant to be used later for gross purposes however its still kind of creepy to take pics of unsuspecting people imo and the joke was like as if her shirt was advertising her genitals so theres that pretty creepy in my book i wouldnt feel good if my son posted that id be having a talk with him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so dolphins are the white people of the aquatic mammal world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,typically punching down isnt really funny maybe a person who said a racist joke is or isnt a racist but that joke that thing they said that was racist you know and thats all that matters we can say hey that joke was kind of shitty man we dont have to talk about them or go through a list of past behaviour to see if that joke was ok or not and it also gives people leeway to change for the better if they arent just labeled forever as something but yeah punching down jokes arent considered funny here or even by most professional comedians its considered kind of cheap humour and not very intelligent in the comedy world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i had the joy of coming across a transphobic joke on my facebook feed today the joke was basically melania trump looks like caitlyn jenner lol with an added ace ventura reference in there to make it extra shitty i call it out and im surprised that i get a sort of apology sorry i didnt mean to offend its a pretty weak apology and it left a bad taste in my mouth its almost but not quite blaming me for my reaction rather than the content of the image and it annoys me that thats actually much better than we can generally expect cue another person popping into the thread to tell me how its less demeaning than singling out trans people as a group that cant be made fun of yeahno its like some people need to use other peoples identities as insults instead of not being an asshole ive no idea why this concept is so difficult for some people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my therapist suggests i should trick myself into becoming a functioning adult only problem is i already am a master at tricking myself into not being one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why is it that in civ the only winning move is to not play or capture all the ais couple of turns ago i was loved by all and hated by shaka and sulleiman who were bullying the mayans so i step in liberate some cities perform some embargos started a small war destroying there gold output which results in a peace treaty and now we are back in square one they both continue bullying the mayans and i can do nothing because of a stupid peace treaty also they rub it on my face by demanding tribute from my city states the moment i can start a war i will take it all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ive been hearing people say that awesomenauts needs to go free to play i myself have some reservations about that ie its a smaller game and plays very different to other mobas due to its platformer style it lacks dedicated servers and instead uses peer to peer hosting which will cause a lot of lag in matches and it may only be a short term solution even with over £ worth of skins and two expansions what do you guys think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont really care about much other than sushi right now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im on holiday but i have my laptop and wifi so basically the only thing different from normal is that i can see snowdonia from my bedroom which is cool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i did volenteer work at a rally today my first rally ever it was the clintonkaine one at temple university it was fun and i enjoyed being in a crowd a lot more than i thought tim kaine is such a dad like all the stereotypes of dads made into form reminds me of my dad before he went through a midlife crisis and thought putting swastikas on his riding vest was ok
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to the beautiful people who encouraged me to watch bojack horseman thank you i binged it and it was very good brrap brrap pew pew
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,anyone wanna have a pokèmon battle friend code is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its i hate a poor gay person because theyre poor not because theyre gay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i hate the poor but love weed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shit when you figure out how let me know i have mastered not being a functional adult i got it so down that i feel like a really stressed out teen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok ill bite whats wrong with that france has done much worse tenish years ago by banning headscarves in school which i find ridiculous and unjustifiable but for this decision there is a real problem with foreign countries saudi arabia qatar pumping money into mosques which typically preach extremism telling women to always stay subservient to men and in more than a few cases they were at the centre of recruitment rings for daesh like i know the terror threat is waaaaaaay overblown in the us hell it probably is in france too but over french people have gone to syria to fight for daesh thats a real problem and it absolutely has to be tackled
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,something that you could expect their idea of separation of the church and state is rather different from the american one to put it mildly basically it means the churches would better to know their place or else in the last century it wasnt as bad as in the calles mexico or kemalist turkey but both were inspired by france and that already says something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,virginia resident chiming in he was a great governor really handled shit well after vtech happened too i was actually hoping that obama would pick him for veep back in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,because what reddit needs is another sub openly advocating genocide
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cool was he in constant dad mode then too he is easy to listen to i enjoyed his speech
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,especially commie subs that advocate violence theres what ten already shits sake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kinda he was very cool and funny to listen to back then but the dadmode i think really locked in during his senatorial campaign eta and his ill say one thing though his epic eyebrow was still epic back then too · ͜ʖ ͡·
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your sub belongs in the dumpster with reuropean
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah fascists socialists whats the difference fascists want to cleanse the earth of any nonwhite people socialists want to unite and free humanity same thing when u think about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unite and free humanity gulags sure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you lose any moral high ground or claims to self defense when the highest rated post is you shitheads cheering for the guy who killed cops in dallas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not wrong for the oppressed to attack their oppressors in fact its right very right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wtf u arent making socialists looks good tankies need be stopped
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no more gulag jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im guessing you arent going to listen to a liberal like me so maybe even if you agree with violence as a form of resisting oppression lone wolf terrorism does nothing to help any cause the dallas shootings effectively ended any chance of the nation having a reasonable discussion about the deaths that happened in the week proceeding it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah i agree with icepick man but im not going to police the oppressed or care about cops we were never going to have a reasonable discussion cops do terrible shit and get away with it didnt we just see this with freddie gray
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nothing screams equality like defending slave labour and reenforcing the power structures of capitalism think about who was in the gulags for a minute how many of them were really fascists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,we were never going to have a reasonable discussion that might be true but there is a reason pretty much everyone representing blm immediately came out against the attacks they accomplish nothing in the long run and can make things much worse in the short run
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was muh material conditions that gay people were forced to do slave labour its people like you that are the reason liberals believe in horse shoe theory
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,uh yeah apparently the soviets thought male homosexuality and fascism were linked somehow literal material conditions no tankie defends this today liberals believe horseshoe theory because they are dumb
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also there are moderate national socialists the fact that you paint all socialists in one light and give free admission towards a cultcentric religion of hate and conquest paints your bias even further im speechless apparently muslims are like nazis wasnt enough now nazis are better than muslims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,women in burqas nazis s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny how reddit probably is okay with germans and other white people wearing swastikas because its freeze peaches but muslims shouldnt be allowed to wear burqas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder why redditeurs dont apply their love of free speechexpression to burqas like they do to their antipc joaks oh yeah its because they hate anything not white and male
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fucking owned muslim here who covers her face in public the burqa is just a single manifestation of a garment which achieves the same objective i dont want to kill you or impose shariah in the western country that i live in i genuinely care for my nonmuslim neighbors my husband is active in the community and makes himself available for the needs of our neighbors and we are well informed voters who use our vote to better the needs of our community and country if you were my nonmuslim neighbor in distress i would consider it an honor to put myself in harms way to provide protection for you so umm what am i to you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if nazis cant steal a hindu symbol and fly it over the industrialscale murder of six million innocent civilians then muslim women shouldnt be able to hide their bodies from my eyes and my peen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when comments like this stay up you know the mods of rworldnews are encouraging this kind of bigotry
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well considering the burqa is only really worn in afghanistan and western pakistan it has nothing to do with wahhabism the face covering is the niqab and it is separate from the full length robe also the swastika is a symbol whereas covering up is muslim womens way of adhering to their religious belief of modesty but dont you dare let facts and proper comparisons get in the way of hating billion people for their shared faith
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay but im p sure you can get in big trouble for wearing swastikas in germany
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a joak to share with the world why did the feeeeemale wear clothing that covered her from head to toe to hide from redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wew lad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait what
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that is legitimately one of the stupidest fucking things ive ever heard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i want to drop off the grid and ignore the discourse™ forever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,abd alwahhab was born in the century the veil is a few centuries older than that so it really cant be a wahhabist symbol now can it be but of course that would require reddit to have even the most basic knowledge of the middle east which is too much to ask for
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay so the burqa is a afghanstans thing the niqab is the saudi covering have i ever seen a burqa outside news reporting on afghanistan fuck no and i work in an islamic faith school
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if germans cant wear swastikas then muslims should not be allowed to wear the wahhabism equivalent of swastikas at utc thisnameforrent replied to if germans cant wear swastikas then muslims should not be allowed to wear the wahhabism equivalent of swastikas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,moderate national socialists what
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that same person that being homosexual was ok and even should be promoted as well as the idea that diversity is a strength and empowerment towards a people on a thread titled what opinion of yours did you do a degree flip on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,moderate national socialists the only moderate nazi is a dead nazi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how could you be so heartless as to paint all followers of an ideology as bad when theyre related only in name to evil groups how closeminded of you anyway thats why i think moslems ought to be lynched
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also there are moderate national socialists reddit literally believes that there are moderate nazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sarcasm is a given here s ruins comments
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,both are symbols of oppression
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,freeze peach is only for white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and straight and cis and neurotypical
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think some of them hate everything and never grew out of that whiny teenage nihilistic phase
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no no no its about making them take their clothes off so we can stare at them freeing women from sexist oppression
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but but mooosssluummmmmssss
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,million is only jews killed in the holocaust its million total dead in the holocaust and million total dead in the whole war many by starvation or through nonconcentrationcamp atrocities and most of the perpetrators werent punished even many of those convicted during the nurembergnürnberg trials got sentences lighter than some get today for drug possession nazi crimes are understated if anything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if nazis cant steal a hindu symbol the swastika had been popular within protofascist esoteric circles throughout the german empire for nearly half a century by the time the ndsap was formed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites are so unoriginal fam
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rworldnews mods ok with literal nazis not ok with muslims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aye well the comment thread is deleted now thankfully
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah turns out that whole hitler thing was not a good thing in germany either
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think that was their point swastikas are banned in germany so burqas should be banned in germany the logic absolutely boggles
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey that doesnt sound like a half bad idea
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,forget it oboeplum its worldnews
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,welcome to srs youll be saying that every week around here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a kinder gentler hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,maybe he never met a muslim in his life this guy probably never left his country snd experienced the outside world
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously at what point did any kind of subtlety become abolished there is much less humor in obvious in the nose jokes that explicitly label them selves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,burqas and s are symbols of oppression forcing a woman to strip in front of a male police officer to a level she is uncomfortable with and feels naked is ok then
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you genuinely not have any understanding of systems of power or are you just trolling
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,freeze peach is only for white cis straight male people ftfy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only sawcasms
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep plenty of nazis generals who were complicit in the actions of the einsatzgruppen like manstein served in the bundeswher after the war
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the swastica was a common symbol you would probably find some sort of swastica anywhere in the world its a plus with extra lines its not like its super complex because it was a symbol people in europe used of years ago the nazis adopted it as a symbom of european pride even when almost every group could claim a sort of swastica as theirs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,consistency is important if i am not allowed to murderkill anyone other people should not be allowed to like different things than me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,an excellent point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im more of a hate the degeneracy love the degenerate kind of nazi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the folks who just leave a signed petition on your doorstep telling you to get out of the neighborhood rather than burning crosses in your yard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this guy probably never left his country the word country can be safely replaced with computer chair basement room or maybe even house if were feeling generous
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,idk everyone is scared no one is gonna get it or something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,freeze peach is only for sawcasms fttyffm fixed the thing you fixed for me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no girls allowed bois only
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rworldnews slightly less informing than fox news
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,please leave thanks love the nazis next door
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wasnt really ever a problem for me you just have to make it just clear enough for them to get it but subtle enough that its still cleverfunny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,never seen the acronym before does that stand for straight american white christian anglo saxon males
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for a site that claims to be the front page of the internet its more like a shitty tabloid newspaper
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats not funny i know a halfgerman guy getting go home eu scum leaflets through his door after brexit happened
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but what if no one gets my joke and they take away my redditeur points xd s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,straight affluent white cisgender abledablebodied sexual male i used it a lot a couple of months ago the more common version is sawcsm standing for straight abledablebodied white or wealthy cisgender sexual male but i havent seen that used much either lately
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,daily mail is top submissions so thats pretty much exactly what it is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all ill say is england needs a stronger antifa presence all of this go home x shit needs to stop it needs to be made to stop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if i were an admin or mod of that sub the first way of making it slightly less shitty would be banning submissions from the more subjective sites like the mail and breitbart if somethings in the mail its either made up or theres another site with a better report of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only banned sites are ones seen to be spamming propaganda through bots mostly russian media sources even that was met with a surge of freeze peach arguments the mods wont ban them because the mods know most of their user base are the exact same people who read daily mail and breitbart
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,half a dozen shit sequels to a remade all men oceans and nobody complains
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seriously what the fuck who doesnt know about frank fucking sinatra
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why cant they make original movies like oceans anyone wanna tell them that was a remake as well bonus femalemen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rfemalesandgentlemen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,female it feels slightly insulting reddit in a nutshell
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,psst its not a rebootremake its a spinoff of the trilogy with bullock playing clooneys sister matt damon is confirmed to make an appearance playing his character from the trilogy the most depressing thing about it is that judging by the list of confirmed cameos theres going to be a focus on the fashion industry personally id like something a bit different for them to sink their teeth into but i do enjoy a good heist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have low opinion of reboots in general it would be nice if hollywood made more original content but film producers are so risk averse they only want to work with known properties with preexisting fan bases television is far more bold these days
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and once again something that would be perfectly cromulent in a neutral context ie a non womanhating context is complete shit coming from a redditor redditors ruin everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quark
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but whitewashing is okay because
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so were just going to have you redo an old movie that had men in it maybe that has something to do with the fact that the vast majority of movies are made with a male cast if theyre going to rebootremake a movie its probably going to have dudes in it since most movies are made by dudes for dudes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbf i kinda get the point helena goddamn bonham carter and rihanna are in it id rather see them in an original role imo considering i have a low view of reboots in general but at the same time it probably comes from a sexist viewpoint so eh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,another movie theyre remaking with a female cast it feels slightly insulting we cant come up with a good original movie for this great cast so were just going to have you redo an old movie that had men in it at utc darknovak replied to another movie theyre remaking with a female cast it feels slightly insulting we cant come up with a good original movie for this great cast so were just going to have you redo an old movie that had men in it like cmon am i crazy it feels almost demeaning edit rip my inbox i went to lunch and came back to notifications
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wheres the comment with upvotes lamenting the yearly fast and furious straight male fantasy sequel those are essentially multimillion dollar shitposts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is a really great point i feel dumb for not thinking about it earlier
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who doesnt know about frank fucking sinatra angry teenagers complaining on the internet
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,serious question i dont quite grok whats problematic about that distinction it strikes me as off but in a vague way and im not sure why any chance you could illuminate me here edit the femaleman thing i mean in case that was not clear
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats real
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,original action movie starring all women gets made must be a movie for girls probably dealing with womens issues how boringyuckgirly ill pass spinoffreboot of male nerd movieseries gets made featuring women wow why cant hollywood make anything original and always ruins our wonderful masculine childhood movies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,seems a lot more like hes criticizing the emerging genre than anything hes lamenting that the cast is wasted on a more than likely subpar remake well its not a remake shit head its a spin off more than anything funny how when another one of the million marvel movies come out dudes dont whine and cry about original projects theres zero benedict cumberbatch is an amazing actor why is disney wasting him on doctor strange instead of doing an entirely original story what do you think is the difference asshole heres a hint if oceans was another male dominated cast these chucklefucks wouldnt even be talking about it or giving it a second thought
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,fast and furious is one of the better examples of diversity in current blockbuster movies tbf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theyre using female as a noun which is creepy and dehumanizing like theyre in a nature documentary or something by even more telling when they use manmen in the same sentence as opposed to male makes u think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look no further than marvel for shitty white dude power fantasies also dea else jessica jones no good as daredevil i like the bad guy though he was my favorite part
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,diversity of cisgender straight men which are the worst kind of men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dea else jessica jones no good as daredevil mmm different strokes for different folks i preferred jj to dd dd kinda lost me in the second season
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its sort of like blacks vs black people one definitely sounds worse than the other and tells you a lot about the person saying it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was memeing about white boys whose opinions are almost always ddjjwith the caveat that david tenant is totally greatlc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some people such as yourself look at the logical reasons behind it i like more comedy or i like it darker some people only pretend to look at the logical reasons and prefer one over the other simply for the sex of its lead i believe the op was mocking the second option
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oooh silly me i couldnt tell you were speaking in quotation marks p
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what the fuck is a blm narrative why does everything spooky and scary always have to be a god damn narrative
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of their viewers are white though so they should pander entirely to this white audience oh yeah and bet is racist wheres our white entertainment television
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the blm narrative you mean reality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love how reddit in general refers to blm as if its some cohesive single corporate entity as opposed to the concept of stop fucking killing black people you racist pigs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,narrative is the new agenda something completely meaningless that all political entities have which rightwingers have turned into a snarl word because stupid people think it sounds bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,strominator
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as they should
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people still care about sportsball
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in a better alternate universe maybe
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,espn in general pushes the black lives matter narrative hard in reply to on not to mention that he tries to make everything into a race issue at utc rationalcomment wrote espn in general pushes the black lives matter narrative hard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the black lives matter narrative is that black lives matter i think thats a narrative we should push right now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its the blm narrative narrative
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it implies that it is fictional and constructed which is how reactionaries view the difficulties of oppressed peoples
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was a dark black and stormy nightboo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,cmt
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you mean literally every channel
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white america in general doesnt seem to deal with reality very well if that wasnt already exposed in the with the reaction against the black panthers movement
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is it a sane network espn sucks and although there might be some vague desire to be on the right side of history it may just be a byproduct of the modern american sports scene just having such a preponderance of black folks in it that racial oppression is difficult to ignore and more difficult to perpetuate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,odd way of spelling redditor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats racist s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,exactly i dont see the problem with this at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hgtv
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if friends wasnt white entertainment television i dunno what iswas
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,think about mlk something something dream i think
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rule fucking x also pupbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spike
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it must be stressful to live with constant hatred of anything you dont understand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everytime i see this joak i remain in awe that people still manage to find it funny i mean surely if you repeat something hundreds of dozens of times it will eventually lose its luster
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whenever i see multiple iterations of these jokes in a given thread i just imagine the seagulls from finding nemo showing up and mindlessly squawking them without intonation crowding forward for their upvotes and lmaos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its any opportunity to bash transgender people i didnt used to come here but reddit has become such a god damn cesspool was it always like this and i didnt realise it or what when i first visited i thought this website was cool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really despise non cis people reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,snowflake and trigger cannot be said in any context without triggering punks like these into being assholes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i stared at that title for a minute thinking something was off before i hit send damnit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do redditors have to ruin everything
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can they just let this joke die seriously it wasnt funny the first time and it isnt funny the billionth time they told it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder which of the genders it thinks it is at utc rstvideocustomerhelp replied to i wonder which of the genders it thinks it is httpiimgurcomwdtrbdfpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,everybody knows that predictability is a cornerstone of comedy if you say something unpredictable and original youre like an anticomedian
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its become a meme hopefully itll die out sooner rather than later
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its based on the binary overflow principle it becomes so unfunny that it is funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it was always somewhat bad but it has gotten noticeably worse kia tia fph td redpill imgoingtohellforthis ctown etc all played their parts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its fucked too because their image of gnc folks is centred on ppl who are willingable to stand up and defend themselves when there are so many who have to stay silentcloseted for their own safety
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah for all this subs preening and posturing they really lack any semblance of selfawareness
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do i dare ask what ctown is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,go on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,catbenned
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the c stands for a racial slur
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gnc people are at a much higher risk of violence compared to cis people making them the butt of the joke at every possible opportunity reinforces that violent dynamic calling out these bullshit jokes made at their expense is important
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im actually sort of impressed that this wiki page exists
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not innocuous if it reinforces the dismissal ridicule and alienation that gnc folks already face
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,first what do you disagree with second this is not a space for winning people over its a space for expressing frustration at ignorant and hateful attitudes which reddit is teeming with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,blah blah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love the argument that srs is the source of reddits bigotry for people who will never feel its consequences if we just stopped exposing it it would simply go away
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah hes a jerk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,total jerk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,petition to rename rfunny to redgy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know if this joke was said among my lgbt group of friends i would definitely laugh because its true people in western society believed most still do really that there were only two genders and now that the pressure to conform to arbitrary social standards is lessening all the insecure and hateful cis people are making it touchy for us who are trying to be ourselves the problem is when cis straight dudes on reddit laugh at this joke you know that theyre actually blaming us for making it touchy and thats why context is important for jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in the beginning of what exactly there are mentions of more than genders dating back to ancient mesopotamia it goes back hand in hand with as far back as we have writing and records
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haha i definitely havent heard that before haha great joak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so a post just named xd with the most unoriginal joke just got upvotes i wanna die
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who gilds this garbage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,let me laugh at not only trans people but the thousands of people who died on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,is the joke about how cis people are so insecure about gender that they think acknowledging the existence of nonbinary people is comparable to a terrorist attack
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah a lot of people are pretty touchy about the idea that there might be more than two
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,without even getting to the comparison what do they mean that in the beginning there were two towers in the beginning there were none
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh yeah you were there in the beginning
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,think of gender like the twin towers in the beginning there were two now its a touchy subject in reply to mrsblennerhassit on im still unclear on some things whose helicopter is that whats all that blue stuff the man is sitting in what is a gender at utc deadcell wrote think of gender like the twin towers in the beginning there were two now its a touchy subject httpiimgurcomgxoaoobpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hm once i posted that to srs though it got a few thousand had lengthier wording and wasnt a comment whoops
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the venn diagram between content that would fit in on rfunny and content that would fit in on is a circle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this sums it up quite nicely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but they wouldnt know because history books for kids scrubbed all of that out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in the beginning when god created the heavens and earth of course um i mean er uh science
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,could you please name some of these societies and genders id really like to research this
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditors just wave the science flag because they think it makes their feefees legitimate and more important than the people they are trying to marginalise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought it was funny because i imagined the helicopter abandoning the drowning man due to his unfunny meme
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kill me now humor is dead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,other garbage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,just dont laugh at white people because thats so mean and dismissive and the reason why they voted for trump
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not just history books for kids a shitton of history books otherwise just like anything else thats inconvenient to the narrative c
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikithirdgender
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpwwwpbsorgindependentlenscontenttwospiritsmaphtml
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hot garbage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,redditcom its always the womans faulttm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get that a crimes a crime but in my mind stealing from the women who directly cut him vs stealing from a random stranger arent really the same thing punching someone out of the blue vs punching someone that punched you arent really the same thing either its like reddit has become this sort of singularity where everybody gets worse and worse in this crazy inward spiral of awfulness as they pat each other on the back over how shit the outside world is and how awesome and funny they are stealing from someone who mildly inconvenienced you is different to stealing from a stranger no it isnt because a theyre both strangers and b its fucking stealing its like this guy is the hero reddit deserves hes just as morally apathetic as they are and hes really sticking it to the system way to pay the world back for all the little inconveniences of your lives guys you really showed em im sorry your lives are so hard that a guy who steals from someone is worth looking up to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,december year redditcom footage of a man attempting to kill a woman for coughing is published reddit discusses wheter the man is a hero or a coward that went too easy on the womam meanwhile the skeleton army is on mars running out of supplies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can you imagine if the genders were reversed honestly it looks like those feeemales werent even in line anyway they were just standing around doesnt even look like he cut in line to be honest those bslurs were just waiting for some unsuspecting guy to steal from god i want to punch them in the face so bad
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,two wrongs dont make a right but i think this guy did alright he didnt screw her over by taking something like a phone or passport and even put her wallet back but made sure to charge her for what she did on justification for pickpocketing a women cutting in line at utc perbux replied to two wrongs dont make a right but i think this guy did alright he didnt screw her over by taking something like a phone or passport and even put her wallet back but made sure to charge her for what she did
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont be silly its not always the womans fault sometimes its the fault of people of colour or some other marginalised group
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,really goes to show how many people arent all that interested in any sense of actual justice or even basic morality only aching for a chance to satisfy their fantasies of petty vigilantism reminds me a little of the whole equal rights equal lefts thing it may be lazily couched in egalitarianism or whatever but its pretty clear they just want some justifiable revenge
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the hero reddit deserves someone actually quoted that in the thread lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stealing from someone who mildly inconvenienced you is different to stealing from a stranger no it isnt because a theyre both strangers and b its fucking stealing i would say it is different the first one is less bad although it is still not justified
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,alas without any stemlords and with all our useless arts degrees wed be unable to science the shit out of mars
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,leftist philosophy doesnt suit you maybe you should consider another career
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,especially if theyre women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,show me on the doll where i asked your opinion e for context i originally linked to that trump painting
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh my god no way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wish i had a degree in white supremacy something
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,god forbid a black woman ever be ft away from something they dont endorse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tmi nobody cares about your masturbation habits
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a lot of people have committed suicide after their lives were ruined by rape
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so what about homophobes who drive lgbt kids to suicide manslaughter for them too or is it just fashion envy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wont somebody think of the men
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no room in the title for the last in the chain if someone levels a false rape accusation that leads to suicide the accuser should be charged with involuntary manslaughter its no different than mentally abusing or bulling someone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not like a lot of people who are sexually assaulted try to kill themselves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at most of recorded rape allegations are false only around a third or less of rapes are recorded making the number of false allegations likely below the only person who could benefit from continuously trying to scare people about false rape allegations is a rapist tying to muddy the waters
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh twox
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wonder if that actually happen i think i have heard of this teenager and i felt sorry for him if this was true but seriously reddit just because it may have happened once doesnt mean it happens all the time also if this actually happened shouldnt we be condemming the lady who made the false accusation for giving fuel to the mens rights movement i mean we should be careful to make sure that the accusation was genuinely false but still not cool that she could be so inconsiderate of the millions of women who have been raped but silenced in their suffering i hope i wont get banned for this comment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,isnt reddit all about le proofle logic so wheres your proof your stats or is that only for when poc and women discuss institutional racism and misogyny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a lot of people have commited suicide after their lives were ruined by false rape accusations name two edit all men are babies custody battles mlk would support blm etc
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,remember the case where the guy was falsely accused of rape expelled from school and the courts found him innocent and the school refused to let him back or he just hanged himself a lot of people have commited suicide after their lives were ruined by false rape accusations in reply to dravous on or he just hanged himself at utc pumpkinsnice wrote a lot of people have commited suicide after their lives were ruined by false rape accusations httpiimgurcomellamzdpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why keemstar can make false claims and get away with it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im guessing a lot more people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why guys like keemstar can make false rape claims but its okay cause he has a white penis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,flutterroll its not bullying its criticism of a lifestyle choice s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white heterosexual males arent in danger empathy not registered error error
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess bullying and emotional harm are real now to them for about five minutes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rapists should be charged with manslaughter by that logic
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rarityannoyed honestly reddit what in the actual fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i also recall reading that many false accusations are not necessarily malicious in nature and are easily verified to be wrong by the police the reddit stereotype of the evil feminist plotting to falsely accuse men really happens more often on television than in real life the police have a lot of experience evaluating reports they can quickly recognise most categories of false accusations a lot of people dont have any experience with reporting crimes they are often mentally vulnerable or traumatized they are often pressured into reporting something and the police can be a very intimidating organisation i think as long as people wont be perfect victims false reports will happen what i would like to see is the percentage of people falsely convicted for rape or something like the percentage of malicious and plotted false accusations i bet are incredibly low compared to the figure you mentioned anyone knows
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait how does that math work
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and reddit is worried about the evil feeemale maliciously and falsely accusing them with the intent to just fuck their life up thats probably an entirely different subset of the recorded false allegations driving the percentage of what theyre actually afraid of even lower then they laugh and joak about prison rape those mental gymnastics👌
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,acksyoize me but the logic is so sound you dont need sjw evidence to back it besides theyre all in on the conspiracy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unless its a muslim or arab
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its because theyre too sensitive andor pc but if a saawcsm has his feelings hurt its to the guillotine
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,only because it lets them shit on feminists decent human beings who think rape is actually a bad thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of their actions lead the person to commit suicide maybe so
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i should have read your reply before posting mine spot on
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not op but im fairly sure unreported false allegations wouldnt be included in a percentage of unreported rapes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,perhaps a wrongful death suit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae think disabled kids should die it would be funnier if we raped them first redditsoprogressive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,holy shit the original image is so fucked up first of all who assumes that parents cant love their children just because they have autism thats so fucked secondly who the hell posts that kind of thought on a public forum and how did it get so many upvotes that sub is terrible
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a mental list of subs which always lead me to believe someone is an idiot based on the fact they post in those subs by far advice animals is number that sub is infested by morons a distant second is any gaming related sub and third trump subs btw the op of that linked thread is absolutely atrocious how can you be so lacking in empathy and decency and still consider yourself a human being
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ok as someone on the autistic spectrum that was prone to wander off as a kid that whole thread made me pissed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its like im eavesdropping on a middle schoolers conversation
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as someone with autism fuck you i fucking hate when these assholes use autistic people as the butt of their shitty jokes oh hows this for a joke memes are fucking stupid and cringy as hell fuck you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,try throwing candy in the middle of the street autistic people really love candyi always just hand it out from my van in reply to anditshottoo on thats nuts the autistic kids in my area must be lazy or something at utc wrote try throwing candy in the middle of the street autistic people really love candy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,first of all who assumes that parents cant love their children just because they have autism presumably someone who themselves would revoke or refuse love towards their child if they had autism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,how are trump subs not
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i post on the fallout sub in my defense i just started using reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get why you might associate people who post on gaming subs with that but id hate to be judged by the fact i love playing games
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah candy on the ground is often unsanitary anyway redditlevel missing the point
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yknow thats incredibly sad but probably true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for me aa and gaming have all the same racism and misogyny but theyre bigger and more dogwhistley about it than td so people that arent looking for garbage are still exposed to it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im sure there are exceptions to the rule there seems to me a correlation between people postings in and people having bigoted opinions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i play games myself just the gaming subs are full of bigots and children like the other guy said its the same with rgameofthrones its poison though i love the tv show
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,additionally a large amount of the people who say this sort of thing are the same ones who dont really understand love as a motivator to begin with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh nothing like that usually its just people posting their builds on there or complaints about the game i dont generally see too many bigoted opinions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,generally the subs focused on one specific game are usually much better than the general gaming subs i think this due to the community being much more focused and easier to manage this is the same with subs for movies and tv shows
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the best part is that further down this thread chain someone brings up that redpillers and altrighters have victimhood complexes then a bunch of people swoop in to say thats not true
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah yes those fabricated grievances like the half dozen posts on our front page alone that are calling for exiling or interring a muslims
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a victimhood mentality like the white people who think that fighting against white supremacy is black supremacy and are so afraid of refugees that they want armed police protection
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes clearly this persons problem was that any concerns over us foreign policy were overly validated what world is this dude living in
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can this brilliant academic explain how one goes from feeling like a victim to stabbing almost a dozen people i cant seem to find the link
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its really a strong lesson in the unseen dangers of victimhood mentality in reply to ironicalballs on he wanted to end with massive irony at utc frenchcuirassier wrote its really a strong lesson in the unseen dangers of victimhood mentality when you teach your sons or fellow friends the idea that they are victims over and over again they will seek revenge this happens to a lot of minority communities across the world the minority may invent or fabricate grievances by the majority then some of them will so pollute their own minds that they will seek rebellious activity the dangers of echochambers and affirming other peoples grievances likely this person had a lot of support from people around campus telling him after his complaints oh yeah totally the west is always bad and interfering in world affairs muslims are so unfairly treated you are so right i totally understand your pain yeah its awful whats happening in x place yeah people here in this country are at fault for this until his ego grew people who will likely say an in interview after the masskilling say you know i always thought that he did seem kinda strange but wont tell you about the times they magnified his victimhood mentality they are very guilty as well the fearmongers in their mosque the authorityhaters in their campus the egorubbers and victimmentalitypreachers in their dorms they are all additionally at fault when you rant or agree with people be careful who you are conversing with he didnt come up with this in a vacuum ideology and the people around him played a part and there may have even been blatant warnings that were underplayed by those around him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,did you ever consider that she isnt displaying it are people displaying their hands when they dont wear gloves
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it begs the question to say women arent displaying their breasts it really depends on the intention women are certainly encouraged to objectify themselves thats also part of patriarchy displaying or merely not covering shouldnt on that account indicate one wishes to be gawked at or otherwise that they are trying to suggest anything in the way of an allure or invitation the problem with the posted statement is that it implies all looking is simply noticing which itself is questionbegging
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is also a difference between noticing a womans cleavage and giving her a thorough visual autopsy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey if anyone is looking for some understanding about wellendowed women go read rbigboobproblems the women there are generally not trying to show off for anyone theyre trying to keep covered up and surprise its not easy with large breasts
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people with tits know the difference between a glance at our boobs and some pathetic asshole staring at us like were objects on display youre revealing that you either think people with breasts are very stupid or that youre a fucking creep congrats for you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,never understood why a woman displaying her cleavage would get upset when someone takes notice at utc surewhatever replied to this is great never understood why a woman displaying her cleavage would get upset when someone takes notice remember they are not smart bombs ladies there is a lot of collateral damage when in action
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,to be fair though hands arent exactly in the same kind of world as breasts one can be intertwined with the sex drive whereas the other isnt no one is going to get hot and bothered by a pair of hands just seems like a bad comparison
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or you could just not objectify women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,no one is going to get hit and bothered by a pair of hands idk man theres some pretty sexy hands out there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,breasts arent inherently sexual
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people have hand fetishes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dontim a gay man but we as mammals sometimes see other members of our species as possible mates or we admire a rather impressive looking person its human nature the difference is how we act when we see a very attractive person
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they are in america for now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in america they are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you dont have to be attracted to someone to objectify them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,making us the enemy can you project any harder
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,an idea that isnt based on reality say the people living in a world where sjw death squads roam on campuses and europe is an islamic state
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some of us dont want to embrace an idea that isnt based on reality and thats making us the enemy fixed to be factually accurate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,said every regressive ever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,arent they the ones who are denying reality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some of us dont want to embrace an idea that isnt based on our oppressive perception of reality and would prefer instead to continue being assholes for no reason other than to feel superior and preserve our worldview
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a charming example of psychological projection seriously its like the poster copied the quote from rationalwiki illustrating this obnoxious sort of altrightertarian
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,some of us dont want to embrace an idea that isnt based on reality and thats making us the enemy at utc replied to some of us dont want to embrace an idea that isnt based on reality and thats making us the enemy thats how religions turn people against nonbelievers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,someone said wossnames opponents were acting like children so yes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,something sitting on the front page of rpolitics talking about how atheists had it the worst out of all the religions during this election imagine being so privileged you think being ignored means you had it the worst meanwhile american muslims are wondering if theyre going to get a president thats going to pin yellow stars to their chests
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i sincerely hope most of them are still in high school with how they act
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont worry the rest of us totally dont mind being thrown under the bus just so you can be one of the good ones were all just attentionseeking crazies anyway look at me im the most special snowflake of them all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,does she want a medal for being not like those other girls
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on that normal shes intersex and elaborates elsewhere that she believes the only true normal transgender people are born intersex and everyone else who considers themselves trans is a special snowflake im no expert but this looks like a case of i dont care what the dictionary or several professional bodies say i and i alone get to define this word talk about special snowflakes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im gay but i dont need lgbt movement or whatever okay so you dont want all the benefits of not being murdered or sterilized for being gay that were earned by lgbt activists over the past century
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and rcanada continues in its glorious tradition of being an absolute shitheap
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a white guy and let me just say the sjws are right white men do nothing but rape and bring harm to people of color im white so it must be true that we all agree edit it appears ive been linked to srssucks its just a joak guys dont take everything so seriously
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well im a trans woman and normal trans people dont throw the community under the bus and assure bigots theyre not like the others to win points seriously fuck her and fuck that sub that threads a garbage fire
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow now the term special snowflake means the opposite of what it originally meant special snowflake used to mean a person who constantly assures everyone that they arent like the other group people ignorantly hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have you watched any of videos i learned of her through petersons twitter it is super refreshing to see someone so passionately speak out against these special snowflakes privilege
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh christ the fact that they are talking about fucking blair white as a good and helpful trans person is sickening shes transphobic as hell and a complete idiot ill never understand why any trans person would be against who they are and other like them its super regressive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,comments like this remind me a lot of lgbt who try so hard to fit into the typical mindset without realising how incompatible it is with them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i get why she is doing this it feels like cis people wont hate us as much if we sell out other trans people but thats not true it doesnt really make cis people respect you it just makes them pretend to so they can shit on other trans people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,miss theyre going to stereotype you anyways that is what they do that is how they operate its your choice to side with them but they will turn on you whenever they find it convenient
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah the transtraitor so many many times worse than transtrenders
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mfw they unironically like blaire white 🐷
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just wish that someone would highlight that this ass hat peterson is perpetrating hatred toward trans folks via his dog whistle the sjw is taking away muh freeze peaches nonsense listening to his argument its clear he hasnt any understanding of the legislation the legislation has nothing to do with pronouns its to prevent discrimination over material things like you know housing access and employment hes falsely painting this as a free speech issue i think intentionally to stoke the ire of transphobichomophobic folk which will only further discrimination and hate towards them once he paints it as though rights are being taken away hes playing a very dangerous game with the safety of the trans community
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a trans woman peterson is right please dont let the special snowflakes color your opinion of normal trans people we arent all regressive crazies at utc thenewgirl replied to im a trans woman peterson is right please dont let the special snowflakes color your opinion of normal trans people we arent all regressive crazies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gotta love respectability politics
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,talk about your special snowflakes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,til trans girls do the not like those other girls avril lavigne bullshit too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow fuck that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,now theres a flavor of transexclusionary trans people ive never seen before
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also apparently if people repeatedly misgender you then you should just deal with it and learn to not care not that its something she personally has to deal with at this point of course
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,she sounds like a horrible person to play pictionary with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah no that stuff wasnt fought for we pandered to the cis het majority and then when they decided we deserved rights we got them right we tried not to make them uncomfortable and eventually it paid off barf barf barf barf barf barf barf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have a work week and health insurance but fuck unions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gotta love when people say canada is a progressive country
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i know its terrible every time i venture over there its like getting smacked in the face with intolerance and hatred
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,youre one of the good ones
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,upvoted for bravery and for being le rational and logical i always had a feeling white men were the worst beings in existence but this has confirmed it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,me too thanks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,can confirm am white cishet dude born to upper middle class parents
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just watched that andis all of her videos just her ranting against a video that has no chance to respond who is that one person i feel like every antisjw youtuber uses them as the worst example on sjws
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,she is such a repulsive human being i really dont understand why she feels the need to pander to people who outright loathe her same with girlwriteswhat and milo yiannopoulos
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,shes literally stated that she aspires to be like milo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is exactly it i really dont understand how people are falling for it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not even respectability politics its being a sellout im splitting hairs though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,toast
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,socialized medicine progressive utopia
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you really need to consider this from their point of view though if they ramble incoherently at debate someone who can actually respond then they might not sound smart and they wont make as much money thats the real tragedy if you think about it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,who is that one person i feel like every antisjw youtuber uses them as the worst example on sjws its httpswwwyoutubecomuserrorydeganrepresent hes nonbinary and makes videos about transgender and social justice issues so of course hes a primary target for the youtube hatemob i havent watched many of his videos but he seems a good sort and hes got to be made of strong stuff to keep doing what hes doing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least in the case of milo i think it earned him a lot of money and popularity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they arent the antilgbt crowd are a bunch of malevolent trogs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,milo is really really racist for a guy who wants to bone black dudes that much i legit dont understand how he squares the circle of being hella racist against the dudes he wants to pork doesnt make sense arent you supposed to like people youre attracted to
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,undeservingly passes well thats just rude you think people have to earn the right to live comfortably
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,toast is not offended
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for people that say i am a and i think its okay to say check the other nice things in the side bar for howto
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,compared to what the actual kkk i mean barely
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit is fairly progressive when it comes to race in reply to on i wonder if reddit would upvote a video about a black man in low pants and a hoodie explaining that talking in black vernacular is also acceptable at utc thexantipop wrote i mean ive seen multiple videos that got extremely highly upvoted about aav and how its a perfectly valid dialect that is just and structured as non aav english reddit is fairly progressive when it comes to race at least for the most part its gender that reddit can go a little overboard on sometimes but even then still fairly progressive
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,for more information contact the hmcl supervisor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah it is about race this post is currently on autoapprove so you weepy neonazi coprophiles can stop crying in reports its not going to do any good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,personal self preservation from other races jeez dont be so pc about it just tell us how you really feel also impose their own culture on the one of the areas theyre immigrating to noncomformity is resistance
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,altright not about race ಠಠ mass immigration by illegal immigrants and refugees who dont integrate and impose their own culture ಠಠ its not about race as much as it is personal self preservation ಠಠ
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a root cause here is capitalism as usual
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its actually about ethics in multiculturalism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not about race its about my racist talking points
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is not about race but heres a pu pu platter of racist talking points prime riamnotracistbut material
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not about race its about staying safe by keeping all the brown people out
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh man anuhope ripped them anuone quite expertly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kind of weird how these white people always butcher their own words like cultural marxism and globalization and then yell at immigrants for not speaking perfect english fail
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its not about race as much as it is personal self preservation in reply to aloudmouthbaby on the reason that the altright is opposed to globalism is because globalist institutions ultimately lead to the centralisation of power within said institution and thus infringe upon the sovereignty of the nation states that are a party to the institution that you wrote all of this about globalization and the altright without bringing up immigration is interesting the number one core principle of the altright movement is the establishment of a white ethnostate trade and economic issues are all secondary to that the primary concern of the altright with globalization is how it frequently leads to more open borders and the flow of people between nations i dont understand why that was not included in this discussion at utc voidrith wrote the number one core principle of the altright movement is the establishment of a white ethnostate no it isnt or atleast i dont see it that way there are some altright sub groups that would advocate for that but the majority of the movement is stopping mass immigration from threatening their livelihoods through diversity quotas double standards in hiring outsourced labour and mass immigration by illegal immigrants and refugees who dont integrate and impose their own culture on the one of the areas theyre immigrating to which causes an increase in crimes particularly violent crimes its not about race as much as it is personal self preservation httpiimgurcomtejgyzkpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,omg i am so offended that sjws repeated my words back to me verbatim report report report but sjws get triggered easily
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i would love to see some of the reports you guys get
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if all it takes to destroy your culture is people eating different food or consuming media thats in a different language your culture is fragile as shit and deserves to be destroyed its your fault that it just cant complete in a pluralistic society and its not our job to give you a safe space for your shitty culture to survive jewish culture has survived multiple actual genocides both cultural and literal your culture should be able to get by in a world with a few more mosques and falafel stands
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,what kills me is that this sort of person loves to rant about indoctrination from the leftsjwsjewsassorted minoritiestheir bogeyman of the day yet will without a single bit of selfassessment demand that people coming in here will conform to a single unified culture that is ill defined to say the least and allow themselves to be completely indoctrinated by said culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pu pu platter too ethnic for the fragile whiteys its a golden corral buffet of shitty bland reheated kkk rhetoric
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,my favorite ar meme is one showing some eagle eating a mouse and whining about cultural marxism then quotes the declaration of independence as cultural marxism also i like telling old white guys complaining about indians mastery of english that more people speak english in china and india than in the us uk australia canada so really who does the language belong to but as usual these concerns fall on deaf ears
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do businesses need diversity quotas its cause they already have hired more whites than any other race
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yes i love it when they screenshot the reports
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you know who was the best at making up euphemisms thats right nazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,plus falafel is delicious as fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,probably whatever it is that wasps do because otherwise i cant think of a single white identity
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a glass of milk with dinner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it means guns jesus and racism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im from the netherlands and here it apparently means dressing up in blackface during november
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,boat shoes and being offended by this thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,mayonnaise and yacht clubs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the whole white identity thing really ticks me off do you mean french german ukrainian italian norwegian there is no one white culture portuguese culture and estonian culture are not the same you can be proud of the ethnic groups you come from without being racist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,being an asshole
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,which is just bullshit to make themselves look better they were never going to consider people who arent white even if they are raised and born in the country part of their culture
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think i finally get it white culture is oil drilling and diamond mining
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look it was just sonderbehandlung not vernichtung see two completely different things s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a warm glass of milk with dinner
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh hey its u
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,murican
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,white culture is taking your stuff and blaming you for how shitty things are
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sonderbehandlung i dont speak german but this just sounds like something id have to tell two teens to quit doing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its you ayyyy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it means special handling and was a widely used euphemism for the extermination of people during the holocaust usually jews the second word is extermination so yeah thats the joke
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yyyyyyya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ah noted thanks for letting me know well ill certainly stop teens from doing that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on an anemic op could this motherfucker breathe any harder from simply walking around in his back yard how fat do you think he is in reply to fedorapussydestroyer on could this motherfucker breathe any harder from simply walking around in his back yard at utc wrote could this motherfucker breathe any harder from simply walking around in his back yard how fat do you think he is httpiimgurcomzslqizmpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,true but pointing out haha he is fat lol fatty is still rude
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats still not an actual apology
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,that thread is a black hole of awful
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rodditors finally learning that sometimes being mean makes people feel bad are we in preschool
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,of course
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hey i can admit when im wrong nbsp
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they seriously think that harassing or abusing people will convince them to lose weight oh it worked for this one guy surely itll work for everybody
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,finally learning that sometimes being mean makes people feel bad you look like an asshole
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you can just tell this guy has never been on tumblr once
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gamers are dead nerd culture is garbage
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do these people keep using terms like land whale and yet persist in claiming that they dont hate fat people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if this did happen im assuming its because op did so in the smuggest most diminishing most tacitly racist way possible and then came back to announce that all straight white guys on tumblr will be dragged from their homes and beaten in the street
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,think theyd at least be able to spell it with how frequently they beat this joke into the ground
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,like even if he did he didnt post that saying i am straight and white usually followed by some edge lord crap triggered what are ya gonna do about it etc usually just gets you embarrassed of course any response from the users is considered a victory because lol if the people im trying to antagonize react i am superior to then and i win
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if they circlejerked any harder their dicks would fall off
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,nah you didnt brah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tumblr users making fun of their edge lord post see i told you they would be triggered
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,trigered whats a triger
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i once posted on tumblr saying that i was straight and white apparently lots of massive things were trigered at utc replied to i once posted on tumblr saying that i was straight and white apparently lots of massive things were trigered
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do people who complain on tumblr even go near it yeah it tends to skew left compared to reddit thank goodness but you still have extreme amounts of racism sexism homophobia and general bigotry its just generally easier to avoidbut its definitely there are they really so dumb that they wont even go on the site they purport to hate
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,okay so we hate tumblr because my reactionary internet friends told me soso that must mean tumblr is like a message board or something i cant be bothered to investigate and find out for myself i bet that if you just post things people will just find it and start arguing with you im guessing that was his thought process
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all i get from tumblr is funny videos and overwatch yaoi my wife shares with me go figure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,oh no it wouldnt surprise me if he has just that the triggering thing isnt true people do make accounts and a shitty post trying to trigger people only theyre so completely unfamiliar that it just goes unseen they made one tag when they shouldve made three tags so nobody will ever see this post
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a goldmine for memes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,western civ shits the bed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its top is made out of rubber its bottom is made out of springs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whats a triger a tiny sparko
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,triger was an innovative french geologist
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,a tiger on a tricycle
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the wonderful thing about trigers is trigers are wonderful things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you actually have an argument or are you just here to construct strawmen you should spit it out quick because youre probably getting benned shortly either way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,calm down bro you might shoot up a movie theatre
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also were a total circlejerk so tumblr must be a total circlejerk
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so many reactionary twits toddle over to tunglr and completely misunderstand the format
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heh no response feminists thats what i thought posts to tia tumblr sjws cant even come up with one reason to convert to feminism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there have been several times when has invaded en mass posting as much horrifying and triggering material as they can in tags often used by vulnerable people mentally ill possibly epileptic andor sjws trying to get people to kill themselves im fairly certain that theyve succeeded at their goal in the past
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,or someone found it and made fun of him and he took their jokes at his expense as them being triggered
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thank you mr trump
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i really hope they havent made anyone kill themselves that would be horrible they did for a while spam all leftist tags feminism leftism marxist etc with gore and extreme fetish porn it got so bad that i think ultimately the admins must have stepped in because one day the tags were full of that shit and the next day it all disappeared
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but theyre just trolls so that makes it funny
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,all an elaborate ruse
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this doesnt even follow the form of a joke theres no creating or subverting expectations theres no implication or double meaning they literally just explicitly said i want to chase down women and stuck on for reasons because they probably saw the phrase used in another joke somewhere like i know these people are being disgusting but at least pretend that youre using the structure of a joke here
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,but rape culture doesnt exist right rape is hilarious unless it happens to men right
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,conversely seems strange how automatically assumed to be a pervert and possible pedophile never comes up on the list of male privileges hmm yes strange indeed
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im getting into shape so that i can chase women down in th park in the dead of nightforreasons in reply to downvotedaemon on there is no bad reason for getting in shape im getting in shape to train to kill gorillas at utc thevelourcaptain wrote im getting into shape so that i can chase women down in th park in the dead of nightforreasons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gross i remember after i was raped i had reoccurring nightmares it was dark and someone was chasing me i tried to run but i couldnt seem to move fast enough the attacker caught up andyou know the rest seeing someone joke about the subject of my nightmares is jarring i think i need a shower now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,healthy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,guise its just a joak everything is a joak comedy is the only form of existence in this entire life and everyone who takes anything seriously is actually secretly dead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jokes on reddit no way you dont become wwe champ by making jokes edgypost
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the joke is hes a terrible person and no one should think like this the expectation is hes a decent person who wouldnt be thinking about that kind of thing and the implication is he really wants to rape women i think thats how subversive comedy works
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,prison rape is still le funny joak
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,heres a funny joke when i was in juniorhigh school there was a physical fitness requirement that included being able to do five unassisted pullups so from age onward my friends and i jokingly but not really not at all referred to upper body strength in general and this ability in particular as rape strength that is the strength to pull yourself over a fence or whatever so you can escape a rapist thats the world of a girl ha ha now where do i collect my wicked edgy upboats see its funny because rape is a real and present worry for girlchildren
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if redditors got rid of their ugly personalities they would no longer be redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,such healthy such male such sexuality
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,🎺🎺🎺🎺
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,expectation of decency this is reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you and your friends sound like a real scream
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,your time is up our brd is now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep everyone is joking on reddit especially on the bigger subs apparently not here though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah maybe i should make it clear here that im a woman me and my friends were the girls in that story nbsp ah yes that was the year i started getting hollad at on the street and flashedgropedfrotteured on the bus what a magical time in the life of a young girl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,see its funny because i made you think i might be a halfway decent person for a second there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont hate minorities just women
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hes also halfwoman but his misogyny remains completely shitty
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,stereotyping asian women as bad drivers just fuels ignorance im half asian and my mom and sister drive just as shitty as any other woman ive been in the car with in reply to ariellemonsters on i love casual racism and blindly pigeonholing individuals into stereotypes at utc drunkenpinecone wrote stereotyping asian women as bad drivers just fuels ignorance im half asian and my mom and sister drive just as shitty as any other woman ive been in the car with
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it is also a genderneutral pronoun but it is not one in use it is also one a lot of folks find dehumanizing they is fine we are talking about folks who are not exactly the highest caliber of person here im sure youve seen the petty things people get upset about we should not use that as the bar we judge by at the end of the day it or they are perfectly fine because they are both genderneutral pronouns perhaps the people who have an issue with it have bigger mental issues going on than just that i hate reddit just thought id throw that out there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,not gonna lie as a nonbinary person myself that leaking gender fluid joke would have been great if it wasnt being used in such a dehumanizing context
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its probably gender fluid if they let go of the pants that gender fluid would leak all over the place its a pain to mop up in reply to on thats a guy at utc analvacuum wrote its probably gender fluid httpiimgurcomvhixoulpng
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,people i dont like arent real people wtf
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean thats pretty much the point of humor right dehumanizing people that make me feel uncomfortable
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,as someone whos actually struggling to come to terms with being genderfluid starting well yesterday this funny joke thread really bothered me edit totally didnt mean upackratorama but rather meant the linked thread i meant to agree about the whole awful dehumanizing context
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well i dont like whites and theyre not real people inupiaq humor
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the earliest theory on humor which goes back to ancient times is the superiority theory it explains that the feeling of being amused is aroused in us when another person is revealed in some way to be much more misfortunate whatever that may be compared to ourself perhaps you can call this dehumanizing i dont personally subscribe to this theory myself because it doesnt have much explanatory power when you test it against more than a few jokes i find the more modern incongruity theory or the even newer benign threat theory to be more satisfactory but yes what you say about humor is at least close to one formally established view of the matter
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its definitely reddits idea of humour
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ehr i wasnt saying it was a funny joke lots of us nb people who have been engaged in communities together for a while like to have fun with and riff off of the terms we use especially punnery and the term gender fluid is ripe territory for such jokes and puns i was saying that silly wordplay involving fluids of gender could be great but the bigotry in the op just completely ruins it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,frogout
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats actually really interesting thanks for the info do you have a professional background in this kind of stuff or just personal interest
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so sorry i didnt mean you i meant the linked thread
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thanks just personal ive been reading about it a little this year humour a very short introduction by noël carroll has informed me the most
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i feel like a middle school dropout reading this actually scratch that i actually knew a dropout way back when and hed think this is stupid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,whites have a worse reproductive strategy than ducks or dolphins
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont know about you but i love pressing pussies in reply to padstapasta on well that depends if the cat and the hydraulic press are in separate posts at utc pmmecooldinosaurs wrote i dont know about you but i love pressing pussies
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,racism and classism bffs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,conservative whites and libertarian whites follow the same formula and appeal to superficially different but completely ignorant redditors
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,funny because reddit has the same view of hiphop as most white folk in their
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,amazing that this person chooses to shit on two genres of music that are historically voices for the marginalized and downtrodden yeah theyve both been turned into shells of their former glory if you only listen to radio stuff but writing off entire genres is poor form that can be fixed with ten minutes of clicking around spotify youtube or soundcloud
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i listen to everything except for rap and countrytm
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is a person who listens to white snake and def leppard guarantee it lol drake doesnt write his songs wakka flakka doesnt rhyme lil wayne has a small vocabulary and tpains voice isnt real im actually not convinced that drake doesnt write his songs hes a special kind of cornball total culture vulture tho rhyming isnt essential someone has a very limited exposure to poetry and rap oh man this is a total only boom bap counts because reasons type of guy i bet lil wayne has at worst a standard vocabulary hes likely a krsone fan who maybe listened through half of boogie down productions first album and possibly a handful of krsone solo tracks on youtube i really need to know how he feels about krs calling weezy the greatest ever tpain has a great natural voice he chose autotune to stand out from other singers pure ignorance and proud reddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hiphop is to rap as indiefolk is to country experimental vs formulaic expressive vs profitdriven oh for fucks sake
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont like this music therefore its objectively stupid
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unlike me who only listens to smart people music turns on dragonforce
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont understand why people like this havent thought to make the realization that any genre of music is incredible diverse nickleback isnt all rock music and the spirit and subject matter of struggle and hardship is still very much alive in rap far from all of it is swag oriented
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i dont understand why people think that the radio represents whole genres spend literally minutes listening to johnny cash or other huge folkcountry artists and you can see the depth and breadth of the genre same with rap go listen to rob sonic and aesop rock and they show how diverse even their tiny little corner of hip hop and rap is
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i mean pop country and pop rap arent any good but if you put in the effort to find more obscure artists theres tons of good stuff but wait that requires nuance
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tbh this take on rap is fucking awful even today back circa corporate rap was pretty big and it still is but political and social rap has definitely made a comeback in the past few years such that some not myself personally even regard it as comparable to golden age hip hop heavyweights this not to mention how astonishingly inventive a genre it remains its all about which artists you listen to unsurprisingly e they diss lil wayne its so goddamn easy and so goddamn wrong lol ive not loved his new stuff but listen to tha carter and tell me weezy was not deservedly the cream of the hip hop crop man fuck
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rap music and country follow the same formula and apply to culturally different but completely ignorant audiences in reply to thrustobot on because these country artists usually dont grow up in the country and most of the time dont write their song at utc satanbunny wrote yep rap music and country follow the same formula and apply to culturally different but completely ignorant audiences
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,bingo
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,one of them likes weed though
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,have they even listened to death grips
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah theyve both been turned into shells of their former glory i know jack shit about country but i always question people who say this about rap when wasnt the genre not an amalgamation of stunting party music black pride political activism stories and bars just for the sake of bars just like how it is now like mac dre existed as nasty as they wanna be was a big album three mafias entire history block parties was a big point in the history of the genre ghostface killah and man lets be real kurtis blow is not that good or enjoyable despite being important theres no former glory there the whole if only rap was its former glory thing is just a way for people who dont know much other than boombap and a little bit of west coast to seem informed edit if i had to point out something that i actually think is a negative departure from the former glory its how certain artists and sounds are oversaturating the genre which is a consequence of the internet and southern rap being a little too competitive right now
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats my thing i love both and honestly they do share themes quite often they both talk about the experience of the working class both glorify partying and drinking both talk about poverty and love honestly most of the difference seems to be presentation not really content rap is a bit deeper in my mind but i think that comes from being a mostly spoken word art form
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was honestly in the same boat as this guy about wayne until i heard what other mcs had to say about him still not my cup of tea but now i respect his music
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also ignoring the historical context hiphop is a larger thing and rap is one component of it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love nerd symphonic metal but yeah the idea that its some higher art form because its got dragons in it is hilarious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i fully acknowledge that my love of ridiculous power metal is stupid as hell and thats part of why i like it
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont be silly rock music cant be formulaic and the people who listen to it cant be ignorant at all like those rap and country music audiences s
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is the type of apologism hiphop does not need to be honest aesop rock and rob sonic are fine but they are not shining examples of the genre there is nothing wrong with what plays on the radio drake kendrick lamar freddie gibbs etc these are all exceptional artists this whole railing against the lamestream is such a reddit neckbeard trait
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yep people are acting like this problem is exclusive to those two genres for every miles davis theres kenny gs
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,reddit jerks aesop rock off a lot i like him okay but he honestly doesnt deserve the amount of praise he gets his flow isnt very good because he insists on doing the white person my words need to be as dense as possible because thats smart thing he runs in the same vein as cannibal ox who dont have that same problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sugarhill gang is also pretty good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its just jokes homie no need to get upset by jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,spoken like a tru whiteboi
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ackshually whites arent people theyre speciallybred laboratory animals that get dressed in people clothes for imaginary internet points
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they mentioned only conservative and libertarian white people not all white people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i break mirrors with my face in the united states i just wanted to see how that looked in the rainbow font lol
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats a good point i am being really selfish about the kind of music i find pleasing versus the actual message thats being said i am mainly into folk and country music so seeing it twisted into this sort of fratdude partyanthem thing is pretty disheartening when the genre started from marginalized immigrants weaving their cultures together
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rap is to hip hop as country is to americana both large subgenres
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the idea that its some higher art form because its got dragons in it is hilarious having dragons in it definitely means its better than other metal that doesnt have dragons in it better than rap as a whole though thats just ridiculous but of course rap with dragons would be better than rap without dragons i just like dragons okay
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol even on srs the examples of good rap is two white dudes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,there is nothing wrong with what is playing on the radio thank you i love the rap music that comes on the radio and shouldnt have to apologize for that its catchy fun and easy to dance to if you dont like it thats cool too you dont have to listen to it but calling the audience completely ignorant for enjoying it reeks of elitism and is more than a little bit racist id love to pick apart the ipod playlists of some of these redditors something tells me theyre not all listening to beethovens fifth
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the thing people dont seem to grasp about rap is the incredible variety within the genre im a fan of a ton of artists and in fact have seen aesop rock and rob sonic live but ive also seen lil yachty danny brown kanye west j cole schoolboy q mac miller vince staples tyler the creator chance the rapper pusha t and more live seeing lil wayne in two weeks seeing frank ocean and a tribe called quest in a couple months point is beyond bragging about the shows ive been to that these artists are all insanely different and every single one of them with the exception i think of vince and tyler has seen mainstream success of course the degree of success varies but still these guys are basically mainstream they all have something valuable to contribute and theres no reason to count any one of them out its incredibly ignorant to do otherwise i mean how is it possible that lil yachty exists in the same genre as chance the rapper now consider they have a song together and it works thats just one amazing thing about rap people in that thread talk shit about guys like flo rida lmao first of all theyre ​only betraying their ignorance by assuming​ hes still relevant and second of all who the fuck cares if he makes dumb music whats so god damn high minded about fucking van halen or any other hitmaking rock music its just fun stuff to put on at parties or in the car or whatever shit i dont mean to rant but this topic always gets me heated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait is kendrick lamar played on the radio much ill admit i listen to the radio very little and if i do listen to a station that would play rap its top but he doesnt strike me as someone who would get much play
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im just saying that a lot of what people hear and judge the entire genre off of is what people hear on the radio which is a very specific subset of the genre and isnt for everyone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,aesop rock not shining examples of the genre drake oo im trying to think of the kindest way possible to ask how can you put drake above aesop rock oh my lord aside from that i agree with the premise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kenny g is a national treasure
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i like aesop so much it hurts sometimes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,gary johnsonirl
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i definitely noticed the seeping in of dudebro fake cowboys in country despite knowing little about the genre
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this is a side of country ive wanted to see more of country im from an area that picked up on the country fadits a suburban area thats anything but country in every way bro southern rock its not country its pop rock with southern twang on the vocals is like nailsonachalkboard for me we get it you like beer and trucks and partying but ive got a hell of a soft spot for bluegrass especially when it gets into some real feelingsive found bluegrass can be more emotionally compelling than many genres and dabble in some of the bigger names of older countryfolk cash lightfoot etc any suggestions of artists i can look into
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least when it started hiphop was a larger movement that encompassed rap djing breaking and graffiti
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dragons are neat yeah
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah seriously this shit goes deeeeeeep
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait rob sonic is white
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its racism and having a very western focus western music has historically focused on harmony and melody over other elements like time and rhythm guess what things you really need to get right in pop and rap music
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah no one respects the versatility of hiphop i remember i use to work in a record store and some dumbass said to me how can you like david bowie and then also be a fan of lil wayne its likeare you serious
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hes had two platinum albums that charted at and respectively including two platinum singles that charted in the billboard top and a couple of gold ones too hes not getting the same airplay as someone like katy perry no but hes being played for sure because hes very popular
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,quite easily to be honest aside from the fact aesop rock hasnt dropped anything noteworthy since none shall pass drake has been consistently putting out fantastic albums for years now although views was a little iffy more life was definitely a return to form
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh i realized i havent listen to him since maybe middle school and my reaction of him being a bad saxophonist was just reconfirmed when i tried again learn to play the fucking instrument correctly also soprano is the worst saxophone doesnt have any of the warmth of the lower overtones like the rest
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvstvndlmkgyw
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if youre looking for emotional impact from country music look up the blue sky boys theyre a guitarmandolin duet who began their career in the despite their cheerful name theres a surprisingly high mortality rate in the songs due to sick children jealous lovers etc the louvin brothers are in a similar vein but feature some brilliant guitar work by chet atkins and paul yandell if youre looking for something a little more contemporary id recommend the pine valley cosmonauts the executioners last song its a two volume collaborative effort featuring covers of stuff like cole porters miss otis regrets and the adverts gary gilmores eyes and steve earle doing a great version of tom dooley
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if you like the old stuff i cant recommend townes van zandt more as steve earle once a young protege of townes said townes van zandt is the best songwriter in the whole world and ill stand on bob dylans coffee table in my cowboy boots and say that he later said it was exaggeration but ill quote it regardless my favorite songs of his are and in the same vein you could take any one of the people in townes posse guy clark was a genius the aforementioned steve earle came back around with a lot of bluesinspired stuff thats great and rodney crowell is still doing some stuff i saw steve earle live in birmingham al and he rocked had a young couple as his opener that was pretty good too the mastersons if youre interested the crazy thing about country and rap is how interartist collaborations are so common most of my favorite artists have written songs together despite not being particularly big on the world stage townes van zandt jammed with jerry jeff walker who jammed with ray wylie hubbard who jammed with hayes carll who jammed with slade cleaves who jammed with adam carroll good country and folk artists are only a couple of jam sessions removed from literally any other given artist its awesome sorry i could talk all day about this lmao
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i love when the le real music crowd describes what makes music music they always leave out rhythm and im like you never heard of drums bruh bruh im a multiinstrumentalist and ive done things like all state and dci so seeing all these music elitists who only played recorder in elementary school and took two semesters of guitar in middle school talk like people who make rap have no talent grind my fucking gears
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i guess id be curious to see his play compared to other rappers he strikes me as someone who is so good that stations cant not play him as opposed to stations wanting his kind of sound and seeking him out im definitely in the group that looks down on the radio
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,furthermore he headlines festivals like coachella and his next album is about to put the whole industry on ice pack or so i heard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i disagree in that i think both albums aesop has released since none shall pass have been excellent but im also biased since drakes not really my speed while aesops literariness appeals to the english major in me
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im a little on the fence here tbh i think the impossible kid was an amazing album from aesop i also think hes much better than drake however hes so underground that it doesnt really matter drake is quite clearly the most relevant rapper today no one else dominates headlines like he does except maybe kanye but he doesnt do the same numbers these days i would hold drake up as a great example of the quality of modern rap however he has a strong focus on good lyricism but also a focus on melody that allows him to compete with pop stars while i would say the quality of his music peaked with imo iyrtitl he has consistently raised up very new innovative and talented artists over the years from aap rocky to young thug among many others in short he puts out quality music that innovates and sets trends all while giving back to the culture edit though i do hope kendrick big puns his punk ass
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,none of the saxophones smaller than an alto should exist if youve never heard the horror of a sopranino saxophone i envy you there are two living saxophonists ive heard play soprano who didnt make me want to puncture my ear drums branford marsalis and bob mintzer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,in college i had a theory professor call out our whole class for ignoring rhythm wed been assigned a paper on a specific piece and every student failed to discuss the obvious rhythmic themes throughout we all made sure to write about the plagal cadence at the end though its​ not even just rhythm though time itself is something you can play with in music and rap excels at it hearing artists just hang back on the beat is great and growing up listening to jazz its one of the things that i love about the genre they can also get right on top of it and give the music this driving pulse basie did the same thing and it was more important to his music than any melody was but thats not dadrock so reddit doesnt care
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im speaking from a personal perspective myself im from london uk and i listen to local radio stations out here mostly for local talent i do sometimes listen to major radio stations because im a fan of pop music in general i appreciate a good portion of it might seem vapid at times but im generally of the opinion that music is as good as it ever was which i accept is going to be a hotly debated opinion
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,huh i wonder how uk radio compares to us radio i actually agree that music is generally as good but i think that radio is the worst place to find the good stuff or maybe im just bitter that janelle monae doesnt get way more play
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wow the op admitted they werent even joking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i thought shitty ask science was for making jokes by mostly misusing words or making a play on different definitions this isnt a joke its just a common rephrasing of why people dont understand trans people
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,saw this post on rall i just backed away before even going near it fuck this website in general
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,also wow srs brigaded itself pretty hard
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if trans people are real then how can cis sexists continue in their delusion that men and women are completely different species and gender roles are natural and right oops a little too close to comfort huh
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,transgender man you can tell the person who posted this wasnt laughing with us a la rtransgendercirclejerk because not even the jerkers over there would satirically refer to a trans woman this way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dont you just love satire i do love satire thats why i hate south park how can a transgender man be born with a female brain if gender is a social construct lets just mash two opposing theories of gender together and completely misunderstand everything ever
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i too used to like rshittyaskscience but no longer requiesce in pace on the side i love how the bold tilda looks
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,jesus christ these people obsess over trans people more often than i someone who isnt a bigot think about trans people not in a negative way but i dont sit around thinking about trans people all day like these people do with their hatred
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,wait whats wrong with rgamerghazi and how is it like twox
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,brd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and rgamerghazi has suffered the rtwoxchromosomes treatment i had wondered what was going on with ghazi my confused thought process when checking it out over the past few months reactionary bs in my ghazi why are there all these devils advocates and but what about the men comments happening maybe its some injoke im not getting its either gotten too cool for me or its gone off the rails and i dont think i have anything to contribute either way but your pithy summation makes it all make sense
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,httpsenwikiquoteorgwikitomlehrer we really should stop trying to revive the desiccated skeletal remains one of these days or stop calling south park satire its satire the same way that friedberg and seltzer movies have jokes
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i remember a time i loved satire too until the concept became wore so thin that anything remotely snarky is now considered the epitome of satire honestly i would just stop expecting posters on the internet to be comic geniuses like george carlin trey parker and matt stone its just a recipe for disappointment
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i stay here due to rhiphopheads and rsoccer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol i was like why would a transgender man have a female brain but then i remembered it was a cis who was talking
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it breaks my heart when a silly sub about silly things has something like this happen its all goofy innocent fun then someone comes along and ruins it by stirring up some bs like this and thats when all the comments and upvotes start painting a picture of who youre sharing the site with that ruins it all and you just cant enjoy it the same anymore essentially its the trampoline episode of community
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,these people think about trans people more than i a trans person do
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah im pretty lost on this point too afaik it hasnt been taken over by le redditeurs im still subbed to it and browse it regularly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was referring to some posts made here recently about poop in the gamerghazi comments and the mod visiting and even admitting it went to shit but i dont go there anymore so i wouldnt know
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres been a decent encroachment of white liberals there was a thread linked in here the other day and another one the same day that was full of poop
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,tte to the electrons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,every time this question is asked i have fewer and weaker reasons for staying i dunno if its today but someday soonish ill just never come back and it will be good
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rfullcommunism
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do people slow down to look at bad accidents on the highway
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the smaller gamesubs eg rterraria are pretty neato the bigger ones like the fallout subs minus rfnv are trash tho
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well rtraaaaaaannnnnnnnnns is still pretty fun
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why would a cis man have a brain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hell i see people on there saying its gotten too commie which as a communist i see as a good thing so im not sure how its like twox
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you happen to have those on hand
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if srs dies out cause yall left this site will have zero redeeming qualities at all
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rhiphopheads rtruefilm rstreetwear rpoliticaldiscussion plus all the essjaydoubleyoo subreddits like this one
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,raww rcorgi rmeirl are my reasons
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,raskhistorians and the footballarsenal subreddits mostly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,do you want an imzy invite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rcompleteanarchy
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,they dont its all fleshy mush up there with no actual brain cells its basically a pile of poop inside their skull
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its in their cis peen
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,pretty sure there was another but its impossible to find a specific thread by subreddit
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rpopheads and rbadphilosophy too
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i stay for rmath rbadmathematics rstevenuniverse rmeirl and rsubredditsimulator mostly i was also into rlatestagecapitalism before they got taken over by tankie genocide deniers
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,rtrollxchromosomes and rgoldredditsays are mine but i love yall here too i just cant stand reading the quotes posted here anymore too much stress
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ranime rbadphilosophy rbadsocialscience and raskphilosophy is what keep me around mostly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,purebreeding dogs like corgis is essentially animal cruelty so hate to ruin another one for ya
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah you know what that sounds cool id like to try it maybe ill even just replace my reddit homepage link with that instead
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wasnt really able to get into that website personally i like the forum style reddit has i just dont like the community
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it represents my views better but i dont go there im feint of heart and that place is spooky
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,haydat no true i also keeps some porno up in my headbrain
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i was also into rlatestagecapitalism before they got taken over by tankie genocide deniers yeah lsc was really close to being a good sub until the mods decided to go on a tankie power trip
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,the fempire queerosphere rvegan and rpitbulls mostly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ranime is pretty bad for people with unpopular opinions and theres a lot of pedophile apologia there its still better than most subreddits sure—youre just bound to get a basket of deplorables when anything is animerelated
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a social site like reddit but with a much better community better policies and a cuter mascot
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,theres a fempire community there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats fair
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,unpopular opinion i think this save brendan stuff really sucks it seems like le reddit is propping an already severely depressed dude up completely ironically like to the point theyre almost mocking him which is not cool in addition to being an mra anti womandivorce settlement jerk makes me feel bad for him
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,im really tired of the narrative that everybody believes they are the good guys that i see pushed by so many democrat moderates its just not true there are genuinely bad people who know theyre hurting others for their own selfbenefit and just dont care they never say that outwardly they provide justifications and reasoning so that people will follow them and serve their interests but that doesnt mean they arent aware of their actions bad folks can and do lie a lot we shouldnt whitewash evil
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,its a shitty thing that reddit jumped on because they can jerk about alimony he was a good actor in the day but this just seems creepy and its the same obnoxious tone as rtd
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ugh sounds like a rough spot hang in there
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,it took a good chunk of the day to figure out how to respond to this because i think that almost all people do legitimately believe theyre on the side of good which is precisely why evil is so dangerous very few if any people openly identify themselves as being on the side of evil and most want to believe that whatever theyre doing is good they can and will be completely aware of the suffering theyre causing but as a quick case study of say a reveals the worst evil is done by perfectly ordinary people firmly convinced that the cause their evil acts serve is so fundamentally good that the acts themselves must be good as well evildoers arent some special callous breed of person devoid of empathy and painting them as such is extremely dangerous genuinely bad people who know theyre hurting others for their own selfbenefit and just dont care do exist but theyre a very small minority amongst those engaged in evil
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah that maxim ignores the fact that the world is full of sociopaths
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,this seems to confirm the rtd connection terrifyingly
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,many or most of the foot soldiers of such regimes manage to delude themselves through the ideology of whoever leads them into believing that theyre serving a greater good but im not convinced that those who orchestrate and directly benefit from the entire things arent knowingly selfserving when a corrupt politician embezzles millions from their nations treasury they arent telling themselves that theyre doing it for the greater good they know what theyre doing is wrong they just dont care because they also know it benefits themselves personally in a massive way
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i wouldnt say the world is full of sociopaths just that positions of power around the world are filled with them its a lot easier to become powerful when youre willing to cast ethics aside in order to gain an upper hand in your goals power is also much more desirable when you have malicious intent its one of many reasons im an anarchist among other things
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,ooer
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,well td is one big pol op and tv where the brendan fraser memes started is a pol satellite board so im not surprised
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yknow i didnt think much of anarchism for the longest time but after the events ive seen this year and after doing a little research you guys have some solid points still not fully on board im in a bit of a transitional period politically but you have some good points
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,dae calling out sexists and racists is literally hitler
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,on srs in a worst subreddit thread honestly how is shitredditsays not the top comment on this thread at utc naptakerr replied to honestly how is shitredditsays not the top comment on this thread they are literally a group of redditors who oppose our inherent natural born right free speech and downvote brigade dissenting opinions as to ensure that others can not be exposed to them objectively in a free society there is nothing worse than that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so i just finished my graduation ceremony and it was the most miserable day that ive had this month and im not saying that ironically im not trying to sound funny it was fucking horrid edit my dad just snapped at my mum thanks fuckass we really needed that
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,why do white cis people think oppression can be excused until they experience it firsthand aka never ive seen this a lot lately its annoying
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,if anyone wants a good celeb on snapchat to follow add ufc welterweight carlos condit its pretty much just him hanging with his son training playing with his dogs and being a goofball hes also into cars and has some really cool ones that he posts sometimes if thats your thing
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so i finally adjusted my dress for sixth form prom it now has pockets well actually its more like a kangaroo pouch which is even better
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,hes back at it again
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,man i just love to be condescended to by old american white guys about the implications of brexit dude just decided to join a conversation between myself and another person for no reason too so thanks for that im thrilled to hear about your deep political views such as that scotland wouldnt get many immigrants because its cold there also he thought football would be improved by removing the offside rule so his ignorance is an unending chasm of terrible opinions ⚽️
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,look at what we
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,sorry to hear that i hope it doesnt end up bothering you too much
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i also find it annoying when they actually do experience oppression of some sort class health etc and they just use it as an excuse to tell racial or gender minorities to suck it up because they were able to manage it no problem
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just bought a dress with pockets yesterday im so excited to not have to carry around a purse i hate that of my clothes dont have pockets
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol he cant even spell my username right udukbcaaj has serious issues hes been obsessed with me ever since my write up about kia being a hate sub i blocked him after he initially started pming me insisting that i stole his formatting like how much of an offbalance child do you have to be to insist youre stealing something that literally exists in the format help section of the site hes been sending messages to nothing at all since i blocked him i havent gotten the notices sorry udukbcaaj the guy needs to see professional help
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,most of his examples are three years old i bet if he put this much time in to his middle school homework his mom might give him some more tendies as a reward
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lol you got immediate downvotes someones jimmies are super rustled baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,casting women is literally
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kia is just a misogyny circlejerk now that gg has died down isnt it like half the posts on there have absoulutely nothing to do with vidya gaems and are just whining about the feminazis
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,so why dont they like new ghostbusters cooties
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i just dont get how someone could hate something so much that they constantly give it free publicity out of spite
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i have no idea why you always struck me as a decent person did we have many disagreements
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the question you were responding to made sense but it was kind of a misguided one to which the answer is pretty obviously no
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,lmao i hate people like that the worst kind of people are the ones that think that messi cant play for argentina because he already plays for barca
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,yeah he sent me a pm about his fourth post and got special mentions he wanted me to delete my account if srs ad reddit upsets you much why dont you i blocked him as well also this is why i had to disable un mentions
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,i think the idea is that the movie came out in but it is kind of funny since nerds loooove using as a pointinacan
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kia was never about video games
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,kinda like thedonald
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,basically i mean there may be legitimate reasons for not liking it but the one reddit is clinging to so tightly is the female cast
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,thats an insult to actual trumpets p
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,and yet they go around supporting irrelevant old ancaps like esr
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,at least thefascist still has some chance of achieveing something gg has got to the point where game devs and journalists pretty much ignore them
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,coming into the thread to see that as the only nondeleted comment is so hilariously out of context that it becomes art
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,when has blm killed anyone
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,you want some antiwhite terrorism take a time machine and go back in time to the go to algeria witness the acts of the fln youll see all the actual terror you need
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,surprise
ShitRedditSays,not_removed,godamm edgy kids
