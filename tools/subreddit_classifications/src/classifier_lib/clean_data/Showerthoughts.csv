Showerthoughts,removed,its millions times easier to stay alive in real life tho said everyone whose brain randomly starts hemorrhaging and they bleed to death because a tiny little thing went where it wasnt supposed to and youll never know until you suddenly start the dying process its only easy for you to stay alive because everyone else has to take care of you even if you live alone its still peoples jobs to not let you die from food poisoning or paying a real man to build you a house so you and your family dont die in the street because you dont posses any survival or shelter construction knowledge youre only alive because someone grows food for you so you can take the pots and pans someone else made for you and cook with gas someone drilled out of the earth for you so you can heat up that recipe someone else came up with so you dont die trying out different ingredients that might kill you so no its not actually that easy to stay alive its easy to let other people keep you alive but this isnt the real world you live in a concrete safe zone built to keep nature and wildlife away from fragile humans go outside those borders without someone elses help and youll see how wrong you are thats what happens when you think video games are more than just a script written by someone with every single detail intentionally controlled and intelligently designed

Showerthoughts,removed,because theres more to evolutionary selection than every individual must procreate at every opportunity i think it might be even better to break this into several separate questions three big ones being are there evolutionary benefits to mm or ff sexual activity are there evolutionary benefits to mm or ff sexualsocial bonding are there evolutionary benefits to some individuals not procreating the answer to all three is an unequivocal yes nothing to lose and lots to gain theres no disadvantage to mm or ff sex and a lot of potential benefits eg among some solitary species like opportunities to mate may be very rare so its to their advantage to have sex with every other member of their species that they meet its not like having sex with a partner of the same gender today will make one less fertile when having sex with a partner of another gender tomorrow so theres nothing to lose by trying on the other hand missing a chance to mate could be disastrous so theres a lot to lose by not trying among solitary species like squid sexual connections are very transient among highly social species including most mammals they can be much more significant which brings us to the second question sexualsocial bonding again yes there are significant evolutionary benefits among social species bonding is not just a procreative instinct its also a survival instinct you cant breed if youre dead and forming social alliances with other adults is crucial to both your own survival and survival of your offspring sex isnt the only way to form these social bonds but it is a very good way and again same gender sexual pair bonds dont make one less fertile if one is also having procreative sex eg elephants elephants are highly social animals but adult males and females live separately they interact only during mating season and mf pairings last only as long as that mating season within their herds however mm and ff sexual pair bonds can last decades these bonds form the basis of the herd without which individuals would not survive or the infamous bonobos chimps the closest living human relative as a species they are overwhelmingly and promiscuously bisexual they use sex for everything saying hello reconciling after fights celebrating finding food etc bonobos social hierarchy is based on alliances formed through sexual bonding while those of other closely related chimps are based on physical dominance as a result bonobos groups have less internal violence and are more likely to cooperate in mutual defense finding and sharing food and protectingraising young so that covers bisexuality pretty much all benefit no downside which leaves us with the third question benefits of not breeding counterintuitively yes there can be evolutionary advantages to having a segment of the population not procreate httpsenwikipediaorgwikieusociality is the most dramatic example of that in strongly eusocial species only a small number of individuals procreate while most nonprocreative individuals assist in cooperative breeding by raising the offspring of procreative relatives nonprocreative individuals do not pass on genes personally but traits that carry the potential to create more nonprocreative individuals are passed down in the children of their procreative siblings and relatives whom they then help raise there are also varying definitions of eusocial some requiring irreversibly distinct castes with nonprocreative individuals rendered sterile others consider a species eusocial or primitively eusocial if they exhibit social division of labor overlapping generations and cooperative care of young including ones that are not their own under the broader definition of eusocial some mammals qualify like the naked mole rat some arguments have been made that highly social primates including humans may be eusocial mammals or at least exhibit some eusocial traits we do have overlapping generations social division of labor and cooperative care of young and as a social species where individual survival is intrinsically tied to group cooperation it may be an advantage to have a small but consistent population of nonprocreative adults enter the basically having a gay uncle or aunt increases survival rates of their niecesnephews theyre available to help protect feed and raise their siblings offspring as needed giving the family group something of a safety net counterintuitively a paleolithic woman who had children and all of them were straight was likely to have less surviving grandchildren than one who had children and one or two of them were gay they are unlikely to pass on genes personally but traits that carry the potential to create more nonprocreative individuals are passed down for them in the offspring of their procreative siblings and relatives whom they then help raise

Showerthoughts,removed,people who speak like theyre informed or educated redditors in general are pretty annoying some comments from askscience for example can be so annoyingly haughty it just oozes premed snob or science bookworm who plagiarize their answers as they are not capable of original thought as a rule you should never form your opinion based on the perception of the majority particularly on this echochember
Showerthoughts,removed,telling someone they are not smart enough could actually go the wrong way and considering how condescending reddit can be when it comes to their smarts it will go the wrong way the way i look at it is that we are all smart about something but dumb about something as well and trying to create a class if you will of strictly smart people and strictly dumb people would not end well whats the measurements of smart to some people being smart equals straight as high test scores and admission into a top ten tier university to others being smart is knowing how to survive in a cold cruel world with immense strategy and coming out unscathed i love reddit i really do but some of you all kill me with the me smart everyone dumb attitude on here
Showerthoughts,removed,as much as i enjoy reddit the discussion on smarts and education really grinds my gears such discussions like the current thread are filled to the brim with condescending know it all attitudes when i read such responses i have to wonder if youre so smart why arent you doing awesome things with that smartness then reddit will swoop in with fiftyeleven excuses as to why they cant achieve blame it on everybody else
Showerthoughts,removed,being a nerd does not equal being an intellectual you can be a nerd and still be dumb as shit trust me ive known my fair share anyway reading these comments have kind of blown me away it seems reddit is jacking themselves off about how smart they are again its weird the same ones who love to label everyone else as dumb dont realize how dumb they are themselves and i see that on reddit a lot oh well
Showerthoughts,removed,reddit likes to think theyre smarter than everyone this is something about reddit i do not like heck you can even see it in the current thread to me smarts goes beyond just straight as high test scores and being able to regurgitate facts that your ap teacher fed you to me smarts is creativity critical thinking problem solving skills emotional intelligence people skills self awareness and just plain ol common sense and wisdom unfortunately its something reddit lacks immensely at times

Showerthoughts,removed,oh i agree with that theres no need for a host of people to progress in collegelevel math if education can improve intelligence though math is it ive taken a wide variety of subjects and nothing has the power math does to improve reasoning not even close im a big fan of the humanities but there is no question that the reasoning power in the engineering department is far superior and theres no way to gloss over that yes that is very stemchauvanistic but its true i tutored both composition and math and the differences between students are stark for those in mandatory comp who werent also stem students in my personal observation math was the defining difference and far more predictive than race gender age or any other demographic you give me a black female middleaged math student and i will show you someone superior to just about everyone in ap when it comes to reasoning and problemsolving ability now its because pre med is largely a bruteforce memorizing curriculum but still those ap students are well wasting their formative years rotememorizing huge reams of information which i can do at almost years old instead of tuning their reasoning skills which i think is required at that age my little electronics technician course in the navy never above basic algebra prepared me more for true critical thinking actually have to fix something with no internet and literally no help for thousands of miles than any humanities course could possibly provide so yes i just wrote an essay indicating that its not my opinion that math is essential and my main hope is that more students were forced to learn it or not graduate and wed have a better society because of it
Showerthoughts,removed,our school had a new policy where if they bell rang before you arrived at your next class the teachers would shut the doors and you had to sit the entire period in the detention room so if your last class was on the first floor and your next was on the floor you were pretty much fucked they didnt even give you a grace period of a few minutes if you were even a second too late tough shit idk how this even punished students since it wasnt even our fault we had students all moving at once so theres bound to be congestion the new policy was quickly removed after kids started failing classes due to the stupid policy
Showerthoughts,removed,if thats the case its unlikely they would be prosecuted theres not a chance in hell the school wouldnt contact them before that point was reached not an automated message an actual one on one phone call or meeting at the school its not for occasional skippers its for kids who never attend school making sure you do so is their legal responsibility
Showerthoughts,removed,i like how you ignore the fact that someone is able to pass the last year of highschool without going to much of it have you ever thought about how the schooling system is broken instead of being a motherfucking cunt about how a entire generation acts towards your outdated rules and regulations god go fuck yourself you piece of shit this person has done nothing but skipped something that was unneeded if you really think that someone should be forced to sit in a room with dozens of unfamiliar people just because they should be learning if sickening not everyone needs the same education standards as you did to obtain the same goals you must be pissed that the next generation can skip untold number of days for school and still become a student with extremely high marks i guess that online accredited schooling must make you want to kill everyone that takes it because of the stance youve taken towards this person please just get the fuck off the internet and go back to your old folks home and die already nobody needs a cunt like yourself that attempts to talk shit about a entire generation based on how theyre able to finish work at a pace far greater then what youll ever be able to accomplish your generation has ruined the world your generation has done nothing but set back humanity for untold generations you sir are a disgrace to mankind

Showerthoughts,removed,disclaimer i am not an expert nor have i done any research to back my claims i think pandora began as one of the first if not the first music streaming service that tailored itself based off of the listeners input they were smart and did not release their algorithm to the world so other companies eg spotify try to replicate their suggestion softwate in their own platform the real struggle with pandora is that like most suggestion softwares it needs a lot of input from the listener to successfully learn the listeners tastes so during the beginning stages where it doesnt have enough input it usually makes bad selections nd influences people to stop listening to it after they hear enough bad songs tldr it takes awhile for pandora to learn your tastes most people dont want to wait that long

Showerthoughts,removed,well i personally agree but i think there are some cases where its easy for me to say free speech is best largely because i am in a really safe position relatuvely rich white male yadda yadda i can imagine that there are times when people who are not as lucky as me get really tired of some of the things that are said and feel opressed with no way to really fight back and so i can see why there can be a case for censorship in some places to help protect people from the tyranny of the majority but yeah its complex and dangerous i always think free speech could be the thing that saves us from tyranny but its also a pathway to groupthink with people shouting others down through sheer volume rather than quality
Showerthoughts,removed,agreed i think cursing in general has really lost its power since it has been normalize i wonder what will take its place next

Showerthoughts,removed,there are no tests in existence that can prove mental disorders are medical conditions psychiatric diagnosis is based solely on opinion there is no medical mental illness test the psychiatricpharmaceutical industry spends billions of dollars a year in order to convince the public legislators and the press that psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder depression attention deficit disorder addadhd post traumatic stress disorder etc are medical diseases on par with verifiable medical conditions such as cancer diabetes and heart disease but unlike medical disease there are no scientific tests to verify the medical existence of any psychiatric disorder despite decades of trying to prove mental disorders are biological brain conditions due to chemical imbalances or genetic factors psychiatry has failed to prove even one mental disorder is due to a faulty or chemically imbalanced brain there are virtually no psychiatric disorders that can be verified medically as a physical abnormalitydisease no medical test fact the brain scans that have been pawned off as evidence that schizophrenia or depression are brain diseases have been disproven as valid research most have not been done on drug naive patients meaning someone who has not been on psychiatric drugs such as antipsychotic drugs documented to cause brain atrophy shrinkage other brain scans have shown the brains of smaller children to show smaller brains in comparison to largerolder children and then claimed children with adhd have smaller brains none have been conclusively proven to verify mental disorders as abnormalities of the brain if there were such verifiable brain scans or in fact any medicalscientific test that could show a physicalmedical abnormality for any psychiatric disorder the public would be getting such tests prior to being administered psychiatric drugs no medical test is fact there are no genetic tests no brain scans blood tests chemical imbalance tests or xrays that can scientificallymedically prove that any psychiatric disorder is a medical condition whereas real diseases are discovered in labs psychiatric disorders are invented by committee and voted into existence

Showerthoughts,removed,richard dawkins deals with this in a few of this books the spark that created life from the soup of chemicals that were floating around millions of years ago has almost certainly only happened once it has never been witnessed in nature and never recreated in a lab its still a intensely studied subject and as far as i am aware theres a pretty big financial reward for the person who manages to create life from nothing but chemicals theres been a few people who have claimed to have done so but they have either been lying or their methods were found to have been wrong in some way one example was a team passed an electrical current through a soup of chemical and thought they had made life but their equipment was dirty and already had microbes inside

Showerthoughts,removed,they dont necessarily have to work to give other people free things and not receive anything themselves at a point where one person can work to provide for dozens of people the payment will come not in the form of money but in the form of respect sure if one person had to work to provide for people you might have a hard time finding of the population that will work for others when you change those numbers to where of people can work to provide for then you wont have much of a problem finding people to do the work also the lower the percentage of people who have to work the more respected that work will be and thus the more valuable it will be

Showerthoughts,removed,its a nice thought but im highly skeptical of this idea of a world where no one has to work and everyone can dedicate their lives to art and creativity many people have absolutely no creative talent or creative ambitions they dont read books and they dont care about art and if they could would spend all their time at best playing video games and at worst fucking doing drugs and probably committing crimes divesting unskilled laborers of their responsibilities and giving them infinite free time sounds like the perfect recipe for massive crime waves and lawless ghettos after a while they would take basic income for granted and begin to feel marginalized by the rest of society that would likely look down on them any time you find large numbers of young marginalized idle young men you tend to also find civil strife and violent revolution tldr everything humans touch turns to shit

Showerthoughts,removed,its about thinking through simple problems and writing a way out thats what a writer with years of time to work on her creations should do i think she did do that theres no major plot holes in the book that completely dont make sense what youre entirely forgetting and overlooking in your ignorance is that the books have been out for a very long time people have read them again and again and again this means that theyre now finding all these tiny plotholes that she wouldnt have even considered in her first time writing not ignore the problems like a grader writing fiction as an assignment this is straight up stupid ever heard of pottermore or seen her interviews shes taken tons of time and put a lot of effort into answering a bunch of these questions concerning the hp world maybe do some research before writing something like that and if youre going to be petty enough to say that harrys eyesight not being magically fixed is damaging to the story then idk man go read nonfiction because this isnt for you

Showerthoughts,removed,wait
Showerthoughts,removed,honestly as much as people like to swear it is not a necessary action it is an outburst of emotion can be positive and negative which could be controlled im not talking about being all emotionless like vulcans but mature and controlled enough that you dont do anything without thinking it through entirely for example instead of swearing and starting fights when mad and angry everybody should be able to calmly solve the problem and ensure that whatever went wrong never happens again people would also more easily understand what they did wrong and correct their own behavior if they didnt let their emotions from being scolded control them considering positive emotions people who are extremely happy tend to do things in celebration without thinking them through such as partying too hard after winning the big game nothing wrong with celebrating but you should still remain in control enough not to drink and drive for example personally i try to practice this way of thinking i hold things back just enough that i can usually diffuse a bad situation without raising my voice people cant stand me though because i dont react in the way they expect me to im not perfect though push me enough and i will snap and get loud too usually because of a bad insult or being persistent in continuing a fight im grown up but my father still likes to get loud and make an issue out of something he thinks i have done wrong honestly he is right most of the time and i tell him fairly calmly what i will do about it he doesnt like that and thinks that im just shrugging it off and dont care almost expecting me to fight him on it or give some big emotional apology i really dont know anyway

Showerthoughts,removed,if memory serves rowling never fully explains her magic system in the series which has very weak rules where does magic come from how are spells created how is it that some are tied to an incantation and others to thought whats the deal with combat magic and why cant death eaters defend themselves against basic spells and curses they would have learned as children at the same school shed bring up an interesting idea in one book which you expect would be built on in later installments but it wouldnt go anywhere the time turners for one remember how the entire stock is just destroyed and thats pretty much the last we hear about time magic it doesnt come back into play later this is especially frustrating because in every other respect rowling did an excellent job of planting seeds early on building to a great payoff later the absolute biggest theme without payoff was anything dealing with ancient magic it was brought up multiple times through the series with the most notable example being harrys mothers protection spell lily is supposed to have accidentally or otherwise tapped into some old magic so powerful that even voldemort a prodigy couldnt defeat we know voldemort craves power has researched old magic like the horcruxes while at hogwarts and after and is capable of inventing new spells which is never explained he learns how to fly without a broom something that other wizards had been trying to do for centuries unsuccessfully so what does this build to is voldy after harry to figure out the secret of this power so he can add it to his own are we headed for a climactic showdown between old magic and new magic nah instead at the end deadbledore goes on at length about the magic of a dying mothers love or something rowling chose to center the climax around death contrasting voldemorts fear of death and creation of horcruxes with lilys sacrifice and later harrys sacrifice conceptually that fits but if she had established stronger rules for the magic in her universe more of those plot threads could have been tied up

Showerthoughts,removed,it went from john podesta dnc guy had his emails hacked the op is right they just phished his password but it went from that to hacking our election results to the us election was hacked so yes it became ridiculous but the main thing is the democrat side made a big counter story that now cancels out hillarys email scandals right because both sides now have a big narrative both saying the term hacking and both seem to be blaming each other so who can say whos right or wrong anymore both cancel each other alinsky pride
Showerthoughts,removed,looooooooord knows im not a foolgiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirl
Showerthoughts,removed,yes but its not that simple why do they want to change opinions not to posit that theyre right or some silly nonsense they want to sway public mindset so they can take advantage what do they get in return well ultimately more money thats the end goal rich people who own news networks use those networks to sway public opinion thus passing laws or enforcing mindsets that allow that company to make more money lowering taxes on businesses getting people interested in a product its all for the same end goal cash

Showerthoughts,removed,the riddle appeared in an edition of the knickerbocker a new york city monthly magazine there are quips and quillets which seem actual conundrums but yet are none of such is this why does a chicken cross the street are you out of town do you give it up well then because it wants to get on the other side this joke works off the fact that the answer o get to the other side is selfevident to clarify imagine this joke being prefaces by a slew of similar jokes but with different more absurd punchlines the unexpected patently obvious answer stands in stark and it is expected humourous contrast to the other jokes i speculate that the genesis of the chickenjoke lies in some situation such as the one illustrated above but over time the original context of the joke was lost which left the chicken sadly decontextualized httpwwwinsaneabodecomroboteroticajokesexplainedwhydidthechickenhtml i know it really shouldnt bother me and art such as it is is open to interpretation but the original intent is simply an antijoke and i dont like when people think theyre being clever and spread that misinformation

Showerthoughts,removed,the media doesnt want to stop saying hacking because they know their sensationalist headlines have people believed russia literally hacked the votes
Showerthoughts,removed,i think you underestimate the complexity of a good phish ive been writing a wide range of exploits for over a decade and using them for longer and i have zero faith in my ability to successfully phish someone there are many books written on subjects like recon and building pretext and ive read a couple of them but im also socially awkward so workflows that ive come up with may look suspicious as fuck to people in the real world im hoping to do more phishing this year but yeah its not quite as simple as some make it seem some people are just naturally really fucking good at it

Showerthoughts,removed,amen anytime the selfdriving cars topic pops up its full of people who seem to only know about citybeltway driving i live out in the country itll be more than years from now that cars can figure out how to navigate the curvy hilly pothole ridden frostheaved lineless snow covered roads that may or may not contain stray cows and even assuming they are way farther along at handling this than i expect the average age of cars around here is people cant afford newer cars but suddenly just because they are slef driving we will trash all the cars in use there are a ton of places it makes sense but the idea that no one will drive in less than years is downright retarded just annoys the hell out of me
Showerthoughts,removed,kill yourself on your own time
Showerthoughts,removed,the government will never give up the cash cow of fines for traffic violations
Showerthoughts,removed,the sad part is this implies speed limits are in place for safety and not as a in direct tax due to traffic tickets they do not want to force you to follow speed limits thats technically possible now some counties actually need their traffic tickets to function without which they would need to drastically increase taxes
Showerthoughts,removed,my bet would be insurance rates driving people out of self drive self drivers will be seen as a hugely higher risk so as more people leave self drive itll get a smaller and smaller pool i imagine the same will exist for petrol once saturation of electricity charge points becomes more common more people will get electric cars which will cause more expansion in charging market which will get more people to buy all while petrol and diesel lose market share and start closing pumps and stations

Showerthoughts,removed,also running with the headline russia hacked the election instead of someone from a maybe ukranian ip address either guessed podestas ludicrously easy password of phished him
Showerthoughts,removed,oh god good luck with that theres no way driving your own car with be outlawed in the next years people would riot
Showerthoughts,removed,you go to a gun range to practice the hobby of shooting you go to the track to practice the hobby of manual driving you sure as hell wont be allowed to roam the open streets with your death cage just like youre not allowed to roam the city firing at random
Showerthoughts,removed,thinking manual drive wont be ilegal or being able to afford a car
Showerthoughts,removed,i highly doubt speed limits will stay the same because when a computer is driving its obviously much more precise plus the government likes taxes revenue for speeding tickets so they might encourage people to get behind the wheel every once in a while

Showerthoughts,removed,its not so much him directly saying it he practices whats known as dogwhistle politics in which he says phrases that mean one thing to the general public but are seen as a type of safe words to specific groups like the altright kkk closet racistssexists etc that let them know hes on their side now honestly i cannot tell if him doing this is intentional or not i dont know if he does this to pander or hes unaware of the implications or hes actually one of them id rather not speculate but he mirrors rhetoric thats lead to pretty atrocious things in american history such as japanese internment and mass deportation of ethnically mexican americans in the great depression and operation wetback in the mid part of the century
Showerthoughts,removed,what legacy obamacare with premiums soaring and about to collapse more wars in the middle east leading to isis and a refugee crisis what has he actually accomplished other than having a darker skin tone and not being bush
Showerthoughts,removed,oh please the republic survived jefferson davis reconstruction world war i hitler pol pot the new york knicks saddam heussain george w bush al queada and isis neither donald trump nor hillary clinton can sink this ship like rome before us if were to fail it will be because we suck as a culture
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont really care for the both sides are the same argument you dont see democrats going around calling people traitors for supporting trump you dont see nearly the level of violence and bigotry coming from hillarys supporters the two sides are not the same one went batshit insane and the other is status quo as usual
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,are you fucking serious we always used to joke about ground pounders being kind of dumb but here you go assuming that youre smarter than someone that youve never met in the internet i did multiple tours in afghanistan as a pilot im now a medical doctor no i dont think that youve contributed far more than i ever will you self entitled cunt im surprised that a veteran would be so fucking full of himself did you forget everything from the army dont assume shit and dont get a big head those are two of the basics
Showerthoughts,removed,wtf
Showerthoughts,removed,i think some drugs are unnecessary let me explain why bother taking a dangerous narcotic that people cant get off of when medicinal marijuana can do some of the same things

Showerthoughts,removed,god damn it jesty
Showerthoughts,removed,then how can you remember that you forgot if you cant remember
Showerthoughts,removed,what do you mean by current system then i assumed that the commenter i replied to meant the capitalistic system because references to human greed and selfishness can be found among the very first written records and im not getting how both modern countries and ancient citystates in the fertile crescent can be part of the same system without it being something ridiculously broad like homo sapiens in which case the parts about it being a current system and human nature being highly variable dont make sense
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah a lot of these guys seem like god was playing the sims and set their stats to lol
Showerthoughts,removed,i came here to agree with the op on the asinine nature of healthauto insurance in america stayed to view the arguments anyway this is quite a discussion and im learning a lot i have been driving for years and been paying for insurance for i started my first job right out of college left that job for one that did not initially offer health insurance bought something like cobra through my dad said fuck it went uninsured until the aca did a year of that got a better job with private insurance got a much much better job working for the government have insurance through aetna married wife works for the school board teacher same insurance but a different group holy shit insurance is complicated there is no consistency its really difficult for me to visual someone elses life situation and say one system is better than another in my opinion health insurance in america is always going to be fucked theres no fixing it
Showerthoughts,removed,just remove the cookie and shove the white stuff down your cake hole you pathetic cow

Showerthoughts,removed,hey srs how ya doin srs linces this comment
Showerthoughts,removed,im all for safe spaces that help people get away from harassment or physical harm im not for safe spaces that are used to avoid criticism or hurt feelings the problem is that some people conflate the two sometimes people feel harassed when they are offended when really theyre just offended and thats okay theyre allowed to be offended but they arent being harassed and dont deserve a safe space people also occasionally conflate hurt feelings or outspoken criticism as being the precursors to actual bodily harm which is also more often than not not the case this is my problem with safe spaces on university campuses if there is legitimate concern that a mob is going to beat you down then sure find a safe space but take the time to question if youre just being paranoid if youre using a safe space to avoid having your morals or preconceptions challenged then university probably isnt for you
Showerthoughts,removed,the retards dont get to go to mars
Showerthoughts,removed,its because you dont fully understand the context and nuance of how colored was used then and sometimes now and how people of color is used now but it could easily be confusing for someone rule of thumb dont refer to a person as colored

Showerthoughts,removed,right but everyone does this and thats exactly why i dont go to amusement parks or other popular places on holidays
Showerthoughts,removed,as a csr myself ive found its a pleasant fastforward phrase i dont accept what youve offered me speeds the discussion to the next step can the csr provide a counteroffer or at least progress towards an amenable solution
Showerthoughts,removed,not even srs is a fucking ridiculous hate sub
Showerthoughts,removed,ive actually had plenty of good conversations with people who clearly were not the brightest bulb in the box especially downs syndrome i challenge you to find people who are happier or more infectious with their happiness and jesus the amount of joy they tend to get just being treated like regular people is amazing it makes me both very sad and incredibly happy sad because it really shouldnt be that rare and happy because you can tell it makes their day at the end of the day theyre still people and sometimes some damned good ones at that
Showerthoughts,removed,unfortunately this type of grading system is prevalent in many companies at all levels as a manager i really cant ever give anyone the highest grade because that implies they have no room for improvement similarly when doing selfevaluations it can be dangerous to give yourself the highest grade since it may imply that you think you have no room for improvementthus people tend to give themselves a lower grade than they should its all politics
Showerthoughts,removed,it took me a lot of multitasked time chat open in window to get a domain name company to return money they didnt notify me they were going to take on a service that was useless in my situation privacy renewed but domains were selected to not renew not everyone understands how to do customer service their rule to give no refunds cost them a lot of time and how i was treated will make me consider other alternatives with new domains
Showerthoughts,removed,youre advocating for slavery maybe disguised but slavery

Showerthoughts,removed,im just building off of what op said its pretty stupid really you dont get invited then you work yourself up then you ask to join the party that you werent previously invited to and you get the green light but as op oc said once you have that invite you all of a sudden dont want to go because you just cared about the fact that you were being thought of but then you feel obliged to go and its not like i sit there sulking the entire time or anything sometimes i just genuinely dont find the activities we do fun nevermind the fact that you have to be there the whole time knowing you were initially left out and at the end of the night you just kinda say well truthfully id be happier if i just stayed home so i spent my night learning i wasnt invited securing my own invitation and in the end not having fun but youll sure as hell do it again next time because maybe it beats being home alone its really stupid and sort of a paradox but thats just how i feel about it im not trying to be an attention whore im just expressing my feelings on the subject brought about by the post
Showerthoughts,removed,ooh getting political
Showerthoughts,removed,according the bible any and all sins will send you to hell so simply thinking about fucking your neighbors wife is the same as committing murder

Showerthoughts,removed,😂😂😂
Showerthoughts,removed,assuming youre referring to christianity the bible says in romans because if you confess with your mouth that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved therefore people dont go to hell based on the amount of sins everyone sins they go to hell because they did not except jesus as lord and savior

Showerthoughts,removed,im not saying that every ghost sighting in history can be explained by carbon monoxide poisoning or that every ghost sighting in history was of a person clad in victorianstyle garb i was merely trying to explain the modern phenomenon of people seeing victorian era ghosts because thats where many but not all ghost stories originate obviously i was not suggesting the native americans also saw victorian ghosts

Showerthoughts,removed,its generally a bad analytical approach to medicalize folk beliefs people dont imagine stories and folklore because they consistently misinterpret reality folk stories do a job in whatever society develops them so you have to understand how people think about fact and fiction in context its something we do too imagine if someone years from now thought that maybe century people told so many stories about superheroes who could fly because they saw skydivers fall from planes and thought that maybe that meant that some special people could defy gravity of their own power that ignores a lot of evidence primarily the fact that skydiving was wellknown to this society and even if it wasnt a universal experience there were experts who knew all about it and that expertise trickled down into the common social knowledgebase but it also ignores something hugely important what superheros meant to those people who told their stories what fears and hopes they represented what aspirations and extrapolations they were a way to imagine a better world and a superhero is an argument that we consume not just a story if you have power you should have responsibility if we had more power this is how we should use it this is what defines a moral agent whos slipped the bonds of the possible since century people lived in an age that constantly made it its business to expand the definition of possible these stories turned out to be immensely important to the people for whom thinking about yesterdays fantastic fiction became a lifeanddeath necessity for planning todays decisions now if thats what superman and spiderman and captain america mean to us then what does a ghost mean to lady macbeth and to shakespeare and his elizabethan audience what does a ghost mean to a victorianage londoner or a iowaborn american in why are there always and forever ghostsighting articles in the national enquirer tabloid what do these stories mean to their audience in the supermarket line in podunk kansas why does the idea endure even as it changes forms to suit the shifting concerns of its audience
Showerthoughts,removed,children have small dexterous hands they also love being busy and role playing jobs imnho child labour laws take away the opportunity for children to develop as fully capable agents in the work market this benefits those who legally put their kids kids to work these people are the same politicians who make the child labour laws conflict of interest

Showerthoughts,removed,sure excess of everything is bad but cigarettes are just one of the worst things you could do to your body coffee and some other drugs at least have upsides the high you get from cigarettes is not even close to being worth all the risks like cancer breathing problems tasting less smelling bad ruining your skin and harming others if you just smoke at the train station for example also it is addicting like hell i just can never wrap my head aroung the idea of cigarettes being good in any way not even speaking about all the money you spent just to ruin your body sorry man it is just a well studied fact that cigarettes mostly have bad sides and all the positives you get are mostly from satisfying your addictionneeds so thats why i think even a few smokes per day are lethal i just do not see the point in spending money to slowly make your body worse or even kill yourself that is also true for alcohol and a lot of others drugs and i do not understand how the media and society can support that either

Showerthoughts,removed,not to break up the jokes but i think stoicism is more about controlling your behaviorfeelings in the long term a deep kind of selfmastery hedging your emotional bets with pessimism is just one technique to better control yourself if optimism happens to promote the development of your most adaptive self in a situation a stoic wouldnt usually oppose it out of principle but superficially pessimistic attitudes are the most wellknown and relevant overall my favorite is the technique of imagining someone you love the example was a young beloved son dead and decaying then youve kind of given yourself metered doses of terror and grief as opposed to taking it all it once if they do die seems a little crazy but not at a time when most kids didnt survive childhood

Showerthoughts,removed,you guys are some really fucking crazy people that dont understand the nuances of situations seriously let me break down the ignorance of your argument you argue operators arent robots and that operators would break rank if they have guns guess what you think the government doesnt vet people before they get into those positions jesus christ the ignorance of real life application so if some break rankslets assume the government wanted to do something bad they will just arrest those breaking rank or kill them youre whole assumption is that one day its correct and the government does a in a quick away that it allows operators to break rank and in that whole process youre also assuming the operators arent being properly vetted to make sure they comply you guys are some paranoid conspiracy theorist that want to base your gun regulation on the idea of a the government someday coming for you and you being able to prevent them from doing it thats a fucking terrible way to go about gun regulation
Showerthoughts,removed,thats how it works with gun nutsanectodoes because they themselves did better than cops than all gun owners are better than cops and it ignores that its more than just marksmanship its about dealing with the situation and handling yourself under real life pressureyou know things that many cops train for and even more annoyingpeople like udaksols provides no sources to back up his comments but gets upvoted

Showerthoughts,removed,the us government is not concerned with basic security but also with where the code originates from they like having us built code because theres less outside influence from other countries sure you can lock in x version of y library but what happens if theres a security vulnerability that needs patching but since then the code was updated by mostly russians who introduced changes we dont want it can become a hassle however that doesnt stop people from using it most popular oss is safe enough to use every due to how tried and tested it is and its very open to collaborators and they do recognize the benefits of not recreating something that would take like a couple years to reinvent
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah if youre implying reddit is a hobby thats a stretch i mean this is a website specifically dedicated to discussing topical events but subs are separated according to topic for a reason i cannot stand when political bullshit totally derails a thread of conversation on a sub not dedicated to political bullshit much like in this context i think thats pretty logically consistent if you want to grandstand then good for you but do it on a neutral platform and if youre trying to accuse me of being a hypocrite for voicing an opinion here the difference between me and op is im trying to put this fire of stupidity out not spread it like gonorrhea

Showerthoughts,removed,ive been creating wikipedia articles lately it is extremely easy to post bullshit to wikipedia and have a source to backup its going to be harder with bigger and more interesting topics but its going to be easier with less interesting topics i submitted a source the other day that spelled the persons name wrong is that a source you want to trust i wouldnt meanwhile i used a persons blog as a source to prove that they do exist but it was shot down
Showerthoughts,removed,austin tx whip them out in public whenever you want and perfectly legal
Showerthoughts,removed,i wish you were thrown off a cliff as a baby
Showerthoughts,removed,if anything the problem with wikipedia is that its often too technical here are two quotes one from the article on number theory the other on the article for lichens euclid ix — is very probably pythagorean it is very simple material odd times even is even if an odd number measures an even number then it also measures half of it but it is all that is needed to prove that displaystyle sqrt sqrt is irrational pythagorean mystics gave great importance to the odd and the even the discovery that displaystyle sqrt sqrt is irrational is credited to the early pythagoreans pretheodorus by revealing in modern terms that numbers could be irrational this discovery seems to have provoked the first foundational crisis in mathematical history its proof or its divulgation are sometimes credited to hippasus who was expelled or split from the pythagorean sect this forced a distinction between numbers integers and the rationals—the subjects of arithmetic on the one hand and lengths and proportions which we would identify with real numbers whether rational or not on the other hand formerly some lichen taxonomists placed lichens in their own division the mycophycophyta but this practice is no longer accepted because the components belong to separate lineages neither the ascolichens nor the basidiolichens form monophyletic lineages in their respective fungal phyla but they do form several major solely or primarily lichenforming groups within each phylum even more unusual than basidiolichens is the fungus geosiphon pyriforme a member of the glomeromycota that is unique in that it encloses a cyanobacterial symbiont inside its cells geosiphon is not usually considered to be a lichen and its peculiar symbiosis was not recognized for many years the genus is more closely allied to endomycorrhizal genera both of those read like they were written by graduate students in those respective fields and not for general audiences the second in particularly is virtually incomprehensible to anyone not directly involved in the field wikipedia has progressed from being a useful quick reference that you had to take with a grain of salt to being a sometimes overlyinformative reference that primarily serves as a springboard for undergraduate research papers
Showerthoughts,removed,i have to disagree with this i wont take issue with utheoriginalretros assertion about academics misrepresenting the credibility of wikipedia to manipulate students into researching the hard way im sure that was done plenty and has value to boot you wont learn much about chasing sources the hard way by blindly following singlesources and unfortunately academic authoritarianism is like that however the assertion that wikipedia has matured to becomesic theres that authoritarianism again very reliable is simply not true and has become a superior source since then so unless theres a doublestandard in operation wikipedia was an extremely reliable source of information years ago what happened to help this myth about wikipedias unreliability was this years ago an overthetop ruskiehating nixonian jingoist by the name of john seigenthaler an editor at usa today was pranked by a user who edited seigenthalers biography page to say that he was a russian spy involved in the kennedy assassinations it was pretty funny and because no one other than seigenthaler gave a rats ass who seigenthaler was the page stayed that way for months when it was brought to seigenthalers attention he unsurprisingly reacted with hysterics demanding the head of wikipedia and violating every privacy rule pulling his leaden weight to extract the ip address and identity of the person who made that edit in addition he and cronies went on a vendetta to discredit wikipedia in the media wikipedias reputation never quite recovered from the attack despite the fact that by every rational measure it is an extremely reliable source

Showerthoughts,removed,burning at the stake or any kind of religiously motivated execution was actually a lot less common than popular culture would lead you to believe unless you were taken by a mob you would pretty much have to martyr yourself or go back on a previous oath of renunciation to be excommunicated and turned over to secular authorities for execution most of the more violent christian purges were either mob driven or had politicaleconomic motivations for example the cathar massacres were mostly motivated by the desire to plunder cathar towns in spite of church efforts to restrain the crusade

Showerthoughts,removed,so to all the unattractive guys saying not me i have a few things to say ill grant you its not likely to be the random cute girl on the bus the one that everyone else has their moment of attraction to whos looking back at you in the same way in fact if youre really an unshaven couch potato with no sense of style you might never get that random moment of purely physical attraction from a complete stranger but if your personality has any redeeming features at all and what constitutes redeeming is way more elastic than you might imagine then i guarantee you someone who has interacted with you has walked away thinking that youd be a catch whether or not they ever expressed it to you take it from a very overweight guy who has been the subject of marriage proposals multiple times including times when i was already married to someone else unless you have totally given up on personal grooming and hygiene your appearance doesnt matter nearly as much as you think it does the best thing i can say is dont undermine yourself be a little bit cocky not a fucking asshole just cocky talk to people youre attracted to like theres a good chance that theyll be attracted back of course they wont be most of the time thats not the point youre looking for the ones who are fake it til you make it it gets easier as you do it also and i cannot emphasize this enough smile at people god damn it

Showerthoughts,removed,and you think its the fault of the weed maybe hes just a shit person and weed makes him not as shitty
Showerthoughts,removed,and i and none of my friends ever get aggressive when drunk now do you see how pointless the whole thing is alcohol is far more pervasive than weed if it was the other way around you can bet your ass there would be a different set of issues associated with that im not saying either is better or worse as far as i know alcohol is more dangerous as a substance in and of itself but its not like weed is entirely blameless either fyi even though ive never done weed the opportunity just never came up go figure i am for the legalization of itthough it smells like shit and i would expect the same laws around smoking to be around weed i dont know who youre trying to sway though

Showerthoughts,removed,this one time when i was a kid my uncle had lent my family a vcr when we were going through a beta transition and did not have one of our own typically we would have just suffered through it but a conflict was created when my mom intended to watch the miniseries roots and my asshole father insisted on watching the hockey playoffs my mom usually let him have his way as she knew his fate already in her mind oh and i wanted to watch murphy brown btw so i get home from school and there it was waiting on the kitchen table and of course it had a porn tape in it nice adulting there ted im like years old for shit sake and this was before the internet too that tape changed my life it was called cherry tricks and it starred ron jeremy and a bunch of greasy mouthed sluts the plot had a bevy of faced beauties with bad teeth competing for the role of the cherry tricks bunny girl the cherry tricks bunny girl was the official spokesperson for the cherry tricks cereal brand anyway in the final scene ron had it narrowed down to two red leather and lace wearing debs picture that scene where melanie tries on the lingerie in the movie working girl but dirty and with less money and they are about to enter into an official eat off in order to determine a winner i cant remember her name exactly it was either deb kathy kathy kath or kathy debbie deb deb but the one who lost ended up losing simply because she wasnt very original in her technique she couldnt have been bothered and she blew her big chance at being the cherry tricks bunny girl and show business although im gay and couldnt truly appreciate what went into that scene i can say that the lessons from that film did indeed stay with me always be original i would never risk blowing it by being anything but

Showerthoughts,removed,nah its totally fine come on up wherever i am and tell me im fat and how you disapprove of that just like to me after that it is totally fine to punch you in the mouth its called being a civil human being you dont to always express your opinions to people because nobody gives a shit about your opinion just because the internet makes so many people brave enough to say whatever stupid mindless thing they want doesnt mean that translates to real life youd be surprised how little acting like that gets you when you forget about the fact that monitor in front of you doesnt protect you in the real world
Showerthoughts,removed,just because something is unhealthy for someone does not grant you the right to accost someone with that fact thats what so many people on social media forget about everyone is so used to spouting off whatever halfbaked thought that pops into their heads on facebook or here or wherever that they forget that its a person they are talking to not just an online avatar or something people arent inherently born with the right to judge others and decide what is best for that person all of us every single person without exception are imperfect i believe one of the reasons so many people act this way is because we are dehumanizing ourselves through increased use of social media to the point we forget that we are all just people trying to get by however we can it is up to each of us to look inwards and fix ourselves not others this is why manners have been a part of polite society for so long until now now more and more people would rather spend time tearing others down instead of examining their own behavior because well who knows maybe they just dont want to look inwards because they are scared of what they will find i dont know but personally i wish more of us would instead of worrying so much about the flaws of others
Showerthoughts,removed,well first off you never said anything at all about addressing the ones you care about thats a rather huge distinction from your implication that it should okay to approach people in general about such things its obviously different when youre speaking about family friends or whoever but at the same time preaching to someone about such things is only going to drive them away from you people in general do not appreciate having their flaws pointed out to them and even though there are people who believe their opinions are so important that they should be held in high esteem and acted on accordingly i can assure you that is far from the truth people as it has been for millennia are just people they will do the things they want to mostly without harming anyone else none of us are better than any others we all have flaws especially the ones who think they do not so we dont have the right to single out others for things we disagree with beyond huge obvious flaws such as rapists murderers etc because those things hurt our society as a whole being fat does not as far as this commercial youre talking about just because it exists doesnt mean it points to the proper way for us all to behave personally i find the idea of it silly probably the work of some government official with too much time on his hands and too much judgement in his heart

Showerthoughts,removed,most redditors dont browse textbased subreddits about a specific niche thats just a fact and you can look at the sub numbers if you dont choose to believe that fact or you can look at this wiki on the if you think oh no my reddit is different like every parent thinks their child is different that says lurk and that was back when reddit was a smaller community do you think that number of lurkers has grown or shrunk oh please yourself even rshowerthoughts a text based subreddit is plagued with reposts as is every subreddit why because people love karma and dont give a shit if their content is original or if they created it is a perfect description of what you fail to see about reddit and has been posted here a million times without credit to the original artist

Showerthoughts,removed,never in your comments you have mentioned of being raped i guess that you need a safespace level of explanation so here goes the thing is that a very large majority of these muslim immigrants are deepwired to associate western women to free prostitutes after all thats whats written in the fucking shitty quran that they blindly follow you cannot change this fact no amount of education can help these world brainwashed individuals why would you want to bring them to your country the majority of those refugees are young men where are the women and children coming from morocco algeria and norisk african countries toss their documents and fake a story they burn your flags they have no education or ambition to studywork and almost all of them live off welfare so unless your vagina is tingling for some middleeastern action i cannot understand why would you want to allow this to continue happening you can butthurt over the way im expressing myself but seriously think to yourself what are you getting out of it logically true there are highly educated muslim immigrants but hey guess what they are not on these boats

Showerthoughts,removed,anyone who thinks this has anything to do with dealerships make money is foolish to have this ability would require every single moving and or functioning part to have self diagnostic sensors computers and transmitters meaning a part that normally costs for the manufacture to buy would now cost meaning your honda civic now costs
Showerthoughts,removed,its a good showerthought and funny of course the sad trith is the manufacturers intetionally force you to go to the dealer becuase that is how dealers make their money repairs in fact it is so bad that the carmakers sued so the third party check engine code devices you can buy can no longer deactivate the check engine light for you afrer you fix the problem you have to go to the repairman to get that turned off now old ones still do it
Showerthoughts,removed,i saw your comment and had to check wow
Showerthoughts,removed,palestinian people fleeing israel read my note on my thoughts about israelpalestine founding of israel europeans squatting in palestinian homes after the palestinians fled conflict know just a thought big note here disclaimer im an arab these are my personal views on israelpalestine i dont think im right i dont profess to be right i am looking at the situation as what i feel is fair when i say squatting i am talking about this happened years ago where i live in the united states if you leave a property for more than years and someone else takes care of it its no longer yours the property formerly known as palestine which is now israel is no longer the right of the people who left it if it truly were theirs they would be living there now the contested land that palestinians think is theirs is not theirs the land that is offered to the palestinians by the goodwill of the people of israel is what the palestinians should consider home israel however should not take back what they have given thats sort of how do we say not cool
Showerthoughts,removed,question anything similar you can do with an older car that doesnt have bluetooth
Showerthoughts,removed,im not a master chef and never claimed to be i am journeyman cook with a lot of experience you fail to justify your opinion that its pointless though is the issue all youve given is a simple sentence that provides only a superficial understanding and description of the position its like saying electricians just get power from point a to point b and thinking you understand whats involved
Showerthoughts,removed,getting the code does not always help anyways getting the code from the vehicle is like you giving me your zip code when i need your address it is a very broad description on what is going wrong with the car not the actual problem

Showerthoughts,removed,right wing left wing i dont care for politics
Showerthoughts,removed,no dont think people actually get offended by merry christmas its just the sort of thing fox news threw out there and the internet grabbed on for the ride because it sounds so outrageous that you just have to click to watch to feel better about your own point of view
Showerthoughts,removed,nope actually it comes back during the times when pork is cheap
Showerthoughts,removed,i mean considering ive been yelled at for saying merry christmas more than a few times im gonna go ahead and say youre wrong
Showerthoughts,removed,false morning is actually based on a time set of hours that everyone abide by christmas or holidays are culturally influenced time is not an influence but a reality as far as you are concerned
Showerthoughts,removed,twice the speed of ludicrous speed
Showerthoughts,removed,the entire controversy and reason stores resorted to happy holidays was because of atheists and leftists getting triggered by people saying merry christmas
Showerthoughts,removed,youre a zealot just like religious extremists difference is you think your ideology is right and that theirs is wrong oh wait they think that too really blind generalizations and dismissals of whole peoples and ideologies are disease
Showerthoughts,removed,any person in your time zone can acknowledge that its morning wishing someone a merry christmas is an implication that they are christian this is more like getting offended when someone says merry christmas happy holidays etc is like getting offended by someone saying good morning because you dont believe in mornings not saying you should go around heckling people about it but its not very considerate
Showerthoughts,removed,wow what the fuck is wrong with you
Showerthoughts,removed,you act like only person has heard screwed the pooch its said a shit ton in the south
Showerthoughts,removed,heres one of my favorite verses isiah god will roll you up tightly like a ball and throw you into a large country there you will die and there the chariots you were so proud of will become a disgrace to your masters house
Showerthoughts,removed,so because work is closed not my choice and i dont have a key because im not the boss i automatically celebrate those holidays yes
Showerthoughts,removed,im not saying never get divorced im saying dont marry for any reason other than intention to be together forever if my partner casually mentioned that they could always divorce me if things didnt work out i wouldnt even consider marrying them if the relationship becomes sour later then divorce can be brought up but going in on with the mindset that its not going to be permanent defeats what marriage is supposed to be an eternal commitment to each other its a covenant and shouldnt be cheapened that way i understand that divorce is sometimes necessary but it shouldnt be something brought up or thought of as an easy way out right at the outset
Showerthoughts,removed,and i bet hes going nowhere in life a real winner yes i can form a general opinion of somebodies ambition and personality based off of how they respond to good morning
Showerthoughts,removed,maybe because youre a year old failure on food stamps id be depressed too if my life was an absolute failure and i was looking at happy couples spending their disposable income on their kids

Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,gay men do
Showerthoughts,removed,does the reason even matter how pathetic do you have to be to care if a woman wants attention what strangers think about your halloween costume why does that upsetannoyor make you feel any type of way i just dont get his whole fanboy white knight bullshit you can still read comics protect mlady but like grow the fuck up i noticed your comment had a lot of hate and toxicity i changed some words around so you can see how it looks to people who dont already share your beliefs i think both variations are pretty gross hope you had a great weekendhalloween
Showerthoughts,removed,hes talking about fat women
Showerthoughts,removed,because girls like to dress slutty on halloween i get the whole feminist outrage over the gendered double standards of attire and how halloween costumes in particular have such a stark contrast but i dont understand this common habit of complaining about the costume availability themself or some mythical society costume companies are not a bunch of mysoginists sitting in backrooms trying to figure out how to get women to show as much skin as they can women choose to take an active participating role in their own sexualization and objectification we can and should certainly discuss what makes girls feel the need to sexualize themselves and how we as a culture have defined sexy but we should also recognize that a woman dressing like a slutty nun is still an awesome feminist form of self expression a woman woke up and chose of her own accord how much of her body she wanted to reveal that day and then she walked the streets in that outfit confident that she was relatively safe from assault or harassment for her clothing decisions it might not be the most progressive form of female empowerment but its empowerment none the less i dont get all the hate on slutty female costumes i have never once seen a woman be actively shamed for dressing conservatively if anything women have far greater freedom in how we dress than most straight men we have more variety and options and yes the common message pushed is to dress provocative but thats a message pushed by other women who usually genuinely enjoy baring their skin as the great movie mean girls explained halloween is the one night a girl can dress as slutty as she wants and nobody can judge her is it sad so many girls aspire to be sexy no its only sad if they only aspire to be sexy the fact that the majority of these slutty costumes are being paraded on college campuses where women are getting more and higher degrees than their male counterparts shows that this isnt the case people can bemoan slutty halloween costumes but its just disguised slut shaming if you dont like the slutty version dont wear it why is it such a problem that educated independent women enjoy feeling attractive is it not equally a problem that straight men have so few outlets to feel physically sexy and show off their body to feel attractive even on the sluttiest day of the year the majority of costumes covers their body like its something to be ashamed of and baring skin is deemed super gay halloween is the day you get to dress as crazy and outlandish as you want a lot of women find feeling sexy to be empowering i do is it me fitting into societies expectations of sexy sure but thats the realities of communities and being at our core a pack animal everything about normal life is conforming to some portion of societies expectations it makes me feel powerful when i wear high heels and short skirts and any attire that makes women feel strong upholds feminist ideals empowerment independence and freedom of choice the real issue for me isnt the abundance of slutty female costumes i think thats human nature i honestly think the sexism is the lack of slutty male costumes equality isnt forcing women to cover up like men because of fear of being labelled a slut its when more men are peacocking around just as vainly because they like feeling like a sexy piece of meat cause truly it feels fucking awesome
Showerthoughts,removed,so you declare all birthday gifts received and when anybody pays you in cash sounds exhausting
Showerthoughts,removed,no zingers friend just genuine goodwill hate is toxic it hurts you and it hurts your cause if you truly feel so strongly on these subjects why not take the time to learn the craft of persuasion so that you can share your views effectively with the world clearly you care very deeply about this but as it is youre only preaching to the choir but anyway i still hope you had a good weekend no zingers
Showerthoughts,removed,thats when guys start talking when there is something sexy it might be a good sexy or it might be a what a slut sexy but sexy nonetheless other than that a person would have to literally look homeless or the guy would have to be very uncharacteristically into fashion to even notice let alone care whereas a lot of women maybe or maybe not most judge clothing choices all the time its at least verbalized a lot in magazines tv pop culture and real life

Showerthoughts,removed,sure but you could have bought riveted handle cookware and had something that would last almost indefinitely that was a conscious choice no sure but so could you which is why ops suggestion of having the option to have detachable handles does not add a point of failure for you and your pans i feel like utelathespy really failed to think that one through before posting

Showerthoughts,removed,wait wait are you saying the country that elected mister orange moneybags is not all about the money that must be why there were so many convictions after the bubble burst thanks
Showerthoughts,removed,speak for yourself mine is just a random selection of letters
Showerthoughts,removed,not even a penny
Showerthoughts,removed,s if not then its mostly because american restaurants hold servers in very low regard and use tips as their wage meals would prob only be more expensive but they tell you otherwise so they dont have to change the system and keep making more money off underpaying servers
Showerthoughts,removed,but but what about capitalism overconsumption is the base without it it would all crumble repairing is the antichrist of capitalism
Showerthoughts,removed,hey the majority of us didnt vote for trump blame the rich people and government instead of us

Showerthoughts,removed,even if somebody gives you shitty service you still owe them say maybe if theyre really really awful heres why in many if not most restaurants theres something called tip share its a shitty practice designed to get around paying anybody a real wage but it exists at a place i used to work i was expected to pay of the bill in tipshare to the hostesses bartenders and busboys if somebody has a bill and doesnt tip i now owe i just made negative money i paid for the privilege of serving you but thats not all servers have their taxes withheld under the expectation that theyre making minimum wage bear in mind that employers rarely make up the difference because its nearly unenforceable so if you dont tip im out of your bill and im being taxed on money i didnt make so its worse than working for free which is slavery mind you im paying to work even the shittiest server isnt a slave and doesnt deserve to be treated like one
Showerthoughts,removed,thats racist

Showerthoughts,removed,just getting my cents on this i dont think people are seeing them as cry babies but rather seeing the whole protest as somewhat of a joke dont get me wrong there are people who are protesting for what they believe in however there are also those who are inside the protest scribbling jokes on signs or wear costumes who take the credibility from a real concern for karma
Showerthoughts,removed,sure if youre gullible and fall for the fear mongering of the left
Showerthoughts,removed,rlgbt is genuinely convinced that there are going to be nazi death camps for gay people and that mike pence is going to force us all to either undergo conversion therapy or die and you have to remember something people used to laugh at the conservatives who said that the aca was going to have death panels

Showerthoughts,removed,certain words are kept asis so the starfleet personnel can gain greater understanding of the situation they are in for example if a negotiation with a klingon is going poorly and the starfleet captain is called a pataq then that is important to distinguish translating it to coward makes it lose some of its meaning getting called a pataq is noteworthy you could almost say certain native words and phrases are part of the official starfleet lexicon simply because there is no perfect translation another example might be the vulcan phrase pon farr translating it to feeling horny simply doesnt do it justice its important that it not be translated

Showerthoughts,removed,well if you are going to label reddit as an echo chamber espousing only those beliefs sure id argue that there are lots of different beliefs represented on this site though i assume it does self select for younger folks i mean being a free and anonymous site you get a lot more idiots trolling and people acting like fools because they have no pushback to improve themselves or be open minded but thats an issue with the internet at large not just here being able to get immediate first hand viewpoints from individuals all around the world probably gives people a more well rounded experience on some things than just following mainstream news and their local paper

Showerthoughts,removed,okay so im in vancouver canada so my advice isnt going to perfectly relevant but most places will have options similar in concept alone if not price relevant if you really want to eat cheap the dollar store isnt the place its where you go if need to eat for a very small amount of money for for a day or two if you are trying to eat cheap for weeks or months there are better options if you can afford the upfront costs and take advantage of the savings over time what im saying is the dollar store is where you eat if youre suddenly short on cash it shouldnt be where you eat if youre poorcheapfrugal just repeating that this might not be true everywhere but i would suspect it is no disrespect meant so starting with bodystarchsubstance generally the cheapest place to buy this stuff is actually larger specialty stores my personal favorite is korean grocery stores i fucking love korean moms and grandmothers if they see a price that isnt reasonable they will raise hell to let the store know around here you can buy massive kilo bags of rice for less than even a kilo bag of rice from costco potatoes can be picked up for crazy cheap in massive volume at lots of large farmer focussed markets you can also store potatoes for months if you keep them right the trick in general is volume and storage times dried beans are a little harder here but i would presume much like rice you could get large dried quantities from specialty stores im talking bags the size of your torso large now for meat well first try skipping it sometimes with mushrooms buying extreme bulk amounts of dried mushrooms can often be done at specialty asian markets i like to buy gallon plastic jugs of them if i really want some meat this is where a costco membership can really pay for itself here buying kilos of ground pork lets me freeze tubes of pork in bags onions work just like potatoes but i normally stick with costco for just massive torso sized bags i do all this for huge portions of dirt cheap food cooking big pots of soup and stew i however only do this because i like to splurge and buy really expensive food the rest of the time so for me its not a cash flow issue i can spend dollars on ingredients for months of easy and good foods

Showerthoughts,removed,i dont like to generalize but the hive mind is too strong everyone wants to be a monolith this is why i say rick and morty is more than just a cartoon with funny moments i hate how we live in a society where we have to sympathize and coddle people feminism is a cult blm is a cult same as kkk which in its active days was far more dangerous than spewed rhetoric and victimhood of blm btw at this point no one is more right than the other western females are one of the most over privileged women on this earth and thats not hyperbolic they create problems for themselves at this point i dont like to generalize as i stated before but this is what we are dealing with now unfortunately one thing that also confuses me is why feminism has claimed the black race and is pointing fingers to white men saying see were oppressed too im not going to sit here and say there is no form of oppression thats a blatant lie but to use it as an excuse to not move forward is also ridiculous sadly we have too much simple people who will follow any propaganda agenda being pushed in their face am black but i dont agree with blm once the black community starts to form infrastructure and actually care about its community the number of murders in chicago alone are staggering then ill peel an ear but in the meantime galvanizing on the streets and repetition of the same rhetoric wont fly

Showerthoughts,removed,well thats what happens when you make the minimum wage livable we could have avoided the real estate crash and bank bailouts just by raising the minimum wage actually thats an overly simplistic assumption solutions like youve suggested have been tried before and inevitably the market catches up for one we know that lowering the minimum wage would actually increase employment levels overall even liberal economists agree how do we know even today interns work for free mentally handicapped workers are paid less by goodwill it would suck for standards of living and for the overall quality of life of employed workers and society in general though httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiminimumwageempiricalstudies now what happens if the minimum wage were increased it sacrifices some level of employment so it means unemployment figures are little higher than it otherwise would be in hopes of preserving at least some level of earning power for anyone with a job however people need to be aware of this tradeoff setting a higher minimum wage can lead to unintended consequences businesses have been known to respond in various ways to cost pressures such as wage increases lay off some employees make existing employees carry more of the load tons of real life examples from coffee houses to comic book stores to giant retail chains this is the classic case of raising unemployment cut benefits to raise wages real life examples were hotel workers who no longer got free meals or a contribution or a reduction in health care coverage or higher health insurance deductibles change the employee mix to have fewer fulltimers and more part timers to reduce the benefits received by fulltimers like with the affordable care act and many employers response to it side note the aca was a calculated windfall for the health insurance industry and big pharma the nation would be better served by a nationalized health care system using the best practices of canada and taiwan along with weight loss and exercise requirements and incentives caps on malpractice and torts and more safeguards against defensive testing and penalties against fraud reduce wages or reduce wage increases or freeze wages for higherpaid employees not so bad honestly unless the higher paid category reaches too far down the hierarchy change some workers to salaried assistant managers so they work hours per days for hours pay there are a lot of assistant managers and shift supervisors already working tiny stores in strip malls hire more undocumented workers and engage in wage theft in los angeles area residents is undocumented and many los angeles workers are paid below minimum wage already especially if one factors in unpaid overtime move to a neighboring town or city a few blocks away as has been done with many businesses that move to another city or county or state or country invest in laborsavings or productivity leveraging so fewer workers can do more just in it i recall back before remote controls and remote connections to view and control remotely connected systems about to or more years ago there were a lot more help desk jobs and roaming techs people who provide online chat support can have multiple chat windows open at the same time these technologies dont create new jobs businesses dont purposefully invest in technology that requires more workers they invest in what will provide a greater rate of return charge higher prices for the same goods or services in effect this is a soaking if a few businesses do it customers may buy fewer things reducing the overall profits if all businesses do it it bone gates negates the minimum wage increase charge the same price but reduce services or water down the quality or make costs a la carte think cheap plastic parts for what used to be metal parts or airline baggage and snack fees etc make the customers serve themselves more via automated systems like web sites and phone menus reducing the number of employees if powerful enough squeeze suppliers with price decreases or coop marketing increases in order to reduce costs or make up for cost cuts make the suppliers cut costs and lay off their employees note has aggregated a number of tactics walmart is using in order to meet the costs of its recently announced voluntary wage increases on the other hand in the marketplace rising wages do raise demand for goods and services increased demand can lead to various responses as well an example is local housing since workers can now bid more for housing maybe somewhere closer to work or with more amenities landlords will update their asking prices over time as they see the bids are higher the rental units with fewer amenities will ride the rising tide as well goods brought into the area from outside the wage increase zone can be relatively cheaper however but if local businesses raise prices to pay wages or to capture the increased buying power then no the higher wages dont buy more goods those who live on fixed incomes the elderly on pensions or on social security those on welfare or now parttime dont typically receive extra for living in a high costofliving area or in an area that has significantly raised the minimum wage so they may face being displaced by rent increases and the higher prices of groceries can negatively affect them even as the minimum wage increases help those with jobs as usual there are economically illiterate people who dont think much about these complexities it would be nice to see a more prosperous society with good living wages for all i especially find it distasteful that businesses pay a minimum wage that may be below the cost of living for a person and therefore enjoy externalizations of the true cost of living by having that cost subsidized by family charity and government welfare but unfortunately especially in an era of increasing saturation of lowskilled workers by the millions reproduction migration and a continuing decreasing need for labor automation offshoring etc it is an ideal far out of reach historically wages were high during times of population decreases or labor scarcity such as after the black plague when workers received high wages and took twohour meal breaks during wwii when men enlisted en masse and women and minorities enjoyed high employment and some measure of prosperity or when the oil patch was booming in north dakota

Showerthoughts,removed,disagree as an introvertintj who doesnt spend much of her time interacting with other people having the opportunity to speak with a cashier is awesome because its one of those rare occasions where you are talking to someone everyone needs to talk to another person every so often but its still a timed interaction therefore not making you feel obliged to keep talking and talking beyond what youre comfortable with
Showerthoughts,removed,hello
Showerthoughts,removed,i think a lot of you dont know what an introvert is its not like when i speak to another human i melt into a puddle of social awkwardness i can handle that im a god damn adult what it means is that social interactions take energy away from me an extrovert will power up from talking with friends family strangers etc but people like me dont its why when i get home i have to be alone for a while and its not the cashier that drains me theyre usually one of the better parts of going out rather its the presence of hundreds of other people you dont have to make smalltalk or anything like that you can just stand there and let them do their job because theyll do it a hell of a lot better than you can just say thank you and walk your awkward ass away
Showerthoughts,removed,that just makes you an asshole

Showerthoughts,removed,pic or it isnt true
Showerthoughts,removed,no you wouldnt start there youd finish there you have to get past the line tills somehow or else you draw attention the easiest way by far is the selfcheckouts if you selfcheckout with your own bags you can basically steal whatever you want just slip it into your bags in the store selfcheckout without bagging groceries as you go and then after youve paid for your cheap shit you bag the groceries into your reusable bags which have you meat and such in them already theres literally nothing they can do you brought those bags into the store theyre as much yours as your purse they cant go up to them and look through them while theyre in your cart this is what people who rob the same store in their hood routinely do best part is if they catch you they really cant prove that you didnt have that stuff in your bag from your last shop or that you forgot to scan it after all youre just a poor idiot trying to use a till the second most common way is to just scan everything and bag it and then push pay with debit grab your shit and leave by the time the machine starts going transaction incomplete youll be seconds away that is what traveling thieves who dont have to return to the store do those are both things you cant do at checkouts the only thing you can do at a checkout is hide things on your body and play it cool which one could also do at a selfcheckout
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont know anyone can use the checkout people unless they have giant trolleys worth of food they actually closed the self checkout the other night it was horrible

Showerthoughts,removed,paging rthedonald
Showerthoughts,removed,happn the app that answers this exact question im sorry if this sounds like an advert im pasting a link to their site and not the app itself so that you can conduct your own investigation httpswwwhappncom
Showerthoughts,removed,its a little rude of us when you put it that way we sit on their backs and kick em you never see a wild horse anymore and they should be wild mehhh now im sad lol

Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,a single dog could counter an army of skeletons the skeletons would just sit on the ground while the dog chewed and scattered the bones
Showerthoughts,removed,wow this reminds me of the essay about that i should be typing right about now
Showerthoughts,removed,you can be aware of information restriction there are known unknowns but also unknown unknowns think about how a north korean boy might view the world with almost no knowledge of what happens outside the border
Showerthoughts,removed,no reading isnt supposed to be fun it isnt the tv but with words instead of pictures reading isnt supposed to be anything reading can be about plot but it can also be about sharing and exploring philosophies it can be about sharing knowledge it can be about viewing briefly the interior of another persons culture the fact that you didnt appreciate a brave new world because it wasnt fun is unfortunate not everything in life has to be fun i know many people resent things that theyre made to do but many educational systems prefer making certain literature compulsory because its important to have an awareness of that literature as a truly competent adult and its irresponsible to believe that every individual will get to it eventually hence the fact that you and all the rest of us were required to read it
Showerthoughts,removed,kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,this comic waaay over simplifies the tactics used in are being used today with increasing effectiveness fuck china has two separate judicial systems one for the proles and one for the party both brave new world and are hugely relevant
Showerthoughts,removed,theres subs that do this manually too im banned from some
Showerthoughts,removed,not even opposing topics but pure thought police stuff at first it was a joke that rpyongyang would ban sensitive jokes about north korea then it became a reality with roffmychest banning subs commenters in rthedonald and other subs using bots if you didnt know reddit uses how often you are banned to decide whether to rate limit submissions if you find that clicking on links from one subreddit youve been algorithmically flagged as a troll user and the fix is to keep you from brigading other subs you basically get when cross clicking into other subs via comment links i was banned from askreddit for accidentally crossing the dont post personal info by giving a fake email as a hypothetical answer on how someone can get docs on a person saw the two above actions took a week bullshit wait before i can get unbanned by jumping through mod hoops from askreddit after getting unbanned those soft ban measures stopped mods have too much indirect power to influence discussion on this site they default mod bans an active user from the sub they mod and can make the experience absolute shit
Showerthoughts,removed,i had to jump on the backs of women before i found one that was cool with it and by jump on the backs i mean sticking the ol pickle in her pooper
Showerthoughts,removed,dont worry it will after the coronation of hillary as king she already controls the major news outlet plus facebook and reddit just watch how this gets downvoted by her thought police
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,youre such a pathetic loser
Showerthoughts,removed,extra dumb this one
Showerthoughts,removed,brave new world i didnt understand that book and didnt like it i didnt read any book about people not reading books i didnt understand that book clearly
Showerthoughts,removed,but even if the means used to guarantee it seem amoral by our standards the end result is that everyone save a minute few is happy not smile or the thought police kill you happy but actually happy even if your job is determined before your birth what does it matter if you actually want to do your job everyone has a job everyone has importance everyone is happy it only seems dystopic because it conflicts with individualistic ideals if youre pursuing the ideal of free to do whatever you want then yeah its horrifying but weirdly enough individualism doesnt lend well to utopic societies save for postscarcity scifi like the culture

Showerthoughts,removed,fuck off being a waiter is nowhere near as difficult as reddit seems to make out its literally being able to write down an order take it to the kitchen bring it back when its cooked fill drinks as needed being the bill like not fucking rocket science even if you have a section of tables there is zero skill or qualifications needed to do it its called unskilled labour and they should be paid accordingly ie minimum wage you dont tip your grocery checkout operator why should servers be treated any differently because they earn under minimum wage from my understanding if they dont make minimum wage from tips the establishment has to pay the difference i hear all the server screamingbut i make more on tips well stiff shit why should you earn more than someone with five times the qualifications for being a glorified delivery boy and doing the minimum amount of work required to do it satisfactorily
Showerthoughts,removed,dallas bbq in nyc is highway robbery they auto tip after pm but dont tell you you wont find out until the bill comes fucking ridiculous i was so pissed i refused to pay my bill and walked out
Showerthoughts,removed,this ill tip you poor bastards any day for an amazing meal wait staff can get fucked they did not slave away in the hot humid dangerous kitchen to make me an amazing meal you guys and girls did the waiter just walked his entitled ass over to the window and back to my table he has done nothing to elevate my experience id walk up to the window myself if there was a way you guys could work it that customers knew that their order was up as appreciation for kitchen staffs hard work ive bought them a number of bottles of scotch tequila or vodka and physically handed it to head chef in front of other kitchen staff as a thank you ive given money to waiters to tip kitchen staff but literally saw the scummy cunt pocket it himself ive seen it done twice hence why i refuse to tip waiters
Showerthoughts,removed,bullshit ive left tips for boh numerous times and every single time its been flogged by the cunt waiter this is also one of the reasons i dont tip ill buy boh staff a bottle or two of booze to share and present it to them in the company of at least other boh staff

Showerthoughts,removed,dont be gay its abosloutly disguisting
Showerthoughts,removed,thoughts are a combination of conscious activity plus small electrical charges in the brain caused by passage of electrons mostly in atoms of sodium and potassium the question that i believe you are trying to ask is how science explain consciousness as humbly explained by bill nye on that fatidic debate evolution vs creationism science is not sure about where it comes from science never claimed it had the answers to all things in fact science is very open about how little we found about existence origin of the universe and afterlife we came a long way and formed a few possible scenarios but the thing about science is that we are always in search for new evidence and in that search we learned so many uncanny new things science might never find all answers it probably wont maybe we will get very close but answers are far too complex for the human understanding but what matters the most science is full of people who refuse to accept the easy way out that religious thought offer
Showerthoughts,removed,hell yeah i think i still have the sheet music for the trumpet section somewhere around here
Showerthoughts,removed,hell yeah i think i still have the sheet music for the trumpet section somewhere around here

Showerthoughts,removed,yeah well someday youll have to explain to your kid that you either drove a good man away or irresponsibly fucked a bad man without consideration of your future good luck with that conversation
Showerthoughts,removed,actually its a policy called gunboat diplomacy teddy roosevelt coined the term you know the quote speak softly and carry a big stick yeah this is what he was referring to basically its like opening negotiations by saying hello friend nice to meet you hows the weather if you cross me you are fing dead would you like some coffee
Showerthoughts,removed,goddamn jesus freaks
Showerthoughts,removed,pineapple trees are not applepines
Showerthoughts,removed,to be fair the most interesting interpretation of star wars ive heard is that neither the jedi nor the sith are good or evil it depends on your perspective in the narrative the sith allow emotion while jedi deny it the confederation used robots arguably nonsentient while the republic used living breathing humaniod clones the clone wars tv series even showed run away clones starting families instead of fighting were told the empire is evil but maybe thats just how you keep control of a galactic sized population i mean the senate was repeatedly shown to be indecisive i believe its because it simply had too many voices and too many agendas to function properly also with the number of preexisting semiindependent planetary governments it doesnt seem like a huge amount changed between pre and post clone wars in regards to everyday life of your average citizens tldr the empire didnt change much for ordinary peoples lives and arguably the villains were more humane than the heros
Showerthoughts,removed,you are old you have run on sentences in your titles please fuck off and kill yourself post pics of your daughter

Showerthoughts,removed,well the argument could be and has a million times been made that in practice it has resulted in war oppression and other nasty things in this life because it doesnt matter heaven so that would be the main point for faith as a bad thing
Showerthoughts,removed,i find myself doing that with twd not because i dont like it but because i dont want it to be over why didnt that bullet hit negans stupid head why rositta 😢
Showerthoughts,removed,perhaps its our society of rapid consumption we dont devote any significant amount of time to something before were off on to the next

Showerthoughts,removed,this isnt very original but its so true that i upvoted anyways
Showerthoughts,removed,completely agree i feel like theres an element of religiosity to ppls political beliefs now beliefs being the operative word to the point where telling most that one of the social constructs on which they base their lives is false is tantamount to telling a christian that jesus isnt real
Showerthoughts,removed,naw thats a myth you can eat it raw and itll still get you stoney balogney
Showerthoughts,removed,you couldnt have a global society based on trade without money in an ideal socialist world everyone would be happy to work for the common good because everyone would be getting tons of benefits in a world based on skills you have the problem of deciding which skills count for more who is really more valuable the heavyweight champion or the head nurse rethink your question

Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,i bet unarmed people who get shot also die because they are very slow at dodging bullets
Showerthoughts,removed,the wider perspective is that he died because he was overweight and couldnt handle a simple chokehold that officers were specifically banned from using it because it cuts the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain and has caused many deaths before
Showerthoughts,removed,more like itt people attacking lochte and showing op how one fuckhead doesnt represent a country of hundreds of millions imagine how downvoted and offensive the post would be if the original story was true and it just said basically all the lochte story has done is confirm my negative stereotype of brazil that would be stupid because brazil is a complex country just as this is stupid because the us is

Showerthoughts,removed,maybe because all the other magical things the cart etc turned back to what they were before the spell pumpkin etc but the shoes were magical as in they were just made to appear from nothing so they just last just an attempt at an explanation

Showerthoughts,removed,its really not that difficult if a person lives with his mother then clearly he doesnt have much wealth status for her to bleed him of it may be a sign that hes a particularly lovingcaring individual but lets be honest folks women just say they give a shit about that if he lives with his wife than clearly he has enough status to get that wife and she has the bonus pleasure to put another woman down at the same time while also getting her paws on the mans resources and getting a status boost in the eyes of her peers basically women are all hypergamous whores its not news
Showerthoughts,removed,there isnt a jimmy johns in nyc

Showerthoughts,removed,most people dont realize the costs of designing engineering and manufacturing a car what seems like a simple change can add up to a lot of money you want there to be different plastics in the lens which means you now need a second mold second type of plastic another step in the manufacturing process more bonding another type of bulb all of a sudden your simple change added in upfront costs as well as increased costs to manufacture each part multiply that by tens or hundreds of thousands of cars and you get a major loss of revenue for the company not to mention if a company decides to make every change people suggest on a car you add millions in development costs and the vehicle goes from a car to a car which can be the difference between people buying it or not source engineer in the automotive industry

Showerthoughts,removed,i dont get people who flip out over the mildest inconveniences like lady just go to another fucking store and calm your goddamn tits the only time i ever flipped shit on a worker was when i was literally stranded in the middle of nyc by an asshole friend after he drunkenly called the police on me in the middle of a petty argument the police officers told me themselves that they would give me a voucher for the ride back they dropped me off at the train station and i was confused because they never handed me any voucher instead saying tell them what happened and they will take care of it for you so i paid for the subway train out to the train station and i did what the officer told me he literally had the most smug expression i had ever seen in my life on a worker and i wanted to knock his teeth off he said smugly well your officer should have come with you thats not our responsibility i have an hearing impairment so i asked could you at least call them and he said again not my responsibility i had the shittiest weekend ever became stranded in the middle of nyc with almost no money to my name so i completely flipped shit i figured that at least in the worst case scenario the police would be called which was what i had been asking him to do all along he finally called the police and they showed up telling me i dont know who told you that or why they did that but that is false information blah blah blah i ended up having to overdraft my bank account to get back to my hometown i wouldnt be surprised if he posted a status about it going all lol hurr durr showed that bitch it just pisses me off to this day because i was clearly struggling that day and that fuckface who was just literally sitting in his seat doing nothing with no goddamn line behind me couldnt be fucking bothered to take a few seconds out of his day to call the police to check with them that was a stupid piece of shit worker and the only time ive ever actually freaked out with a worker in my entire life and i hope it will be my last time thankfully everyone i ran into after that was really nice and the philadelphia train station assistants were even willing to make second phone calls for me because my phone was dead
Showerthoughts,removed,because its the only job within miles that will pay me what im paid currently and because maine is an atwill state
Showerthoughts,removed,also our hemorrhoids plentiful air exposure like that makes mine shoot out like popcorn
Showerthoughts,removed,while that is true for single player campaigns that doesnt necessarily apply to the large amount of people that exclusively play mobas shooters mmos and other types of multiplayer fare however i do agree that video games are a fantastic storytelling medium that weve just begun to explore
Showerthoughts,removed,maybe since its a legal thing now we could drop the barbaric religious garbage attached to it and call it what it is a civil union

Showerthoughts,removed,politics is another sensitive subject its technically everyones civic duty to participate in it so discussions should be encouraged the lack of involvement from the people is exactly why things are the way that they are
Showerthoughts,removed,jesus some of them are hairy

Showerthoughts,removed,id like your cell phone number social security number address a list of your favorite things your facebook password and your credit card number if you dont mind
Showerthoughts,removed,just read upvoted had a conversation with my boss and commented on this post at my work desk i can state that it is entirely sfw
Showerthoughts,removed,but it kind of is assessing your ability legally to be married i had to sign papers saying i wasnt already married to someone else and then the license wasnt valid until like days later i assume in case they found something that made it illegal i think they used to do blood tests to be sure you werent too closely related marriage certificate is the one that says i actually went through with the marriage
Showerthoughts,removed,this is also why polygamy is still illegal id be willing to bet most people dont object to it morally but legally itd be a nightmare how do you split the assets ways who gets which kids do you have to dna test all the children to see which kid belongs to which mother
Showerthoughts,removed,the cornerstone of your argument works against you if you want a baby just get pregnant if youre a guy who wants a baby find a girl who wants a baby and the two of you make a baby and raise it together no idea why you try to ridicule this whats wrong with this why does the government need to get involved in a relationship expect this to be more commonplace in the future
Showerthoughts,removed,thats how we end up with a president that isnt afraid to tell it like it is its a double edge sword if i dont know you i might actually believe you are a sociopath if you tell a dark joke around me i need to know you well enough to know youre very likely not actually serious about killing and tag teaming your dead baby sisters corpse with your dad at a burnt down synagogue before i decide to do business with you i like to believe that reading minds would be a horrible super power because you would learn so many things about other people that you probably wouldnt want to know i much prefer to just smile and talk about the weather off topic but somewhat relevant imo have you seen the show black mirror the first episode is about what it would be like if in the future people where rated on an app based on how much you enjoyed interacting with them like a credit rating or yelp review of how likable you are a dystopian future where everyone has to act like they are working customer service or risk being shunned from parts of society and denied services available only to those with a high rating its on netflix if you decide to check it out
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont have to politely tell my books that i dont plan on getting married any time soon nor do i quietly cuss under my breath when i cant find the older relative im looking for then how that no one notices me at the electronic grandparent kiosk again since i dont want to bother asking the grandparentian for help
Showerthoughts,removed,gee i should really get a stand for my femin its been sitting in my closet for months
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,trump
Showerthoughts,removed,to be fair thats not as much of a gamble as it used to be not due to divorce rates those are worse than ever but because women work now its of total assets not just your assets so if youre that paranoid just find a woman who makes at least as much as you do you only lose if the woman has stop dating poor women thats an honest serious solution and assuming you didnt already have infinite money it reduces the cost of all couple activities by so your money goes further its just so much better no more getting a card and a shirt when shes getting an iphone for christmas i personally wouldnt ever date a poor woman ever again this equality stuff is pretty swell once you think about it child support not included
Showerthoughts,removed,victorias secret has done it a few times
Showerthoughts,removed,we got married so i could have his health insurance and not die a horrbile debtless death we loved each other then now its iffy hes abusive and i dont have the money to get out fun times

Showerthoughts,removed,thats just the religious idea behind it not its legal application
Showerthoughts,removed,are you unaware that theyd have to hire someone to shoot a video at every show and if its a major artist who would probably want quality work they would likely want to hire a team of videographers and that isnt cheap not to mention the extra work for the marketing team and web developer to get you that free download its not free to them to give you a free download its a lot of work to provide you with that service you think you should just be able to get for free and people bitch about the entitled attitude of people who want to feed their families
Showerthoughts,removed,not at all most of the time it is all about lucky timing who sees it and how funnyserious it is and how that relates to the post you can definitely turn it into a marketing style approach but im positive at least of redditors dont give enough fucks
Showerthoughts,removed,louder

Showerthoughts,removed,d
Showerthoughts,removed,what you juste described is called anomie its basically what happens when anarchia fails anarchia is much more complex than no masters no gods pirate ships are known to ne place of anarchia un battle the captain would lead because everyone agreed that a leader was much needed in times of war but other than that every crew member was considered equally the quartermaster was there to voice the crew suggestions and it wasnt rare for a captain to be dropped in the middle of nowhere because he abused his position
Showerthoughts,removed,absolute anarchy
Showerthoughts,removed,the general idea is that multiple commune like places are put together each one made up of a council of all participants in that commune everyone votes for everything and then it is enforced by the community itself and not a form of state also note that despite what anyone says true anarchy is not compatible with a capitalist economic system
Showerthoughts,removed,i have not but i figure it would be worth a shot and i could possibly see if they had a way to time travel so i could just attempt to fix things but i also assume that instead of fucking up the future and drastically changing everything it would just be a separate timeline where i was doing something i liked but if i saw that i was going to be president i wouldnt change a thing does the butterfly affect come into play
Showerthoughts,removed,haha no anarchy the lack of hierarchies and rulers not a lack of order and social cooperation

Showerthoughts,removed,i mean if u want dlc u gotta start paying for it but its really hard to just straight up lose the game

Showerthoughts,removed,affirmative action gave scholarships to minority groups for equal representation in some universities turns out when you send people from schools that dont properly prepare you for ultracompetetive universities you get poor results
Showerthoughts,removed,really if you want im sure it would be in your nature to copy and paste someone elses answer to this
Showerthoughts,removed,sure as hell would no idea why one of the laws of thermodynamics got down voted though energy simply gets traded around from one thing to the next your bridge going down turns into the reaction you see in the water etc etc its way more complex with that but thats kinda the idea

Showerthoughts,removed,most of mine is heartbreaking stories like the kid who got her self ready and to the bus stop when her parents odd some of its damn near snuff films that people love to upvote in rvideos rtherewasanattempt
Showerthoughts,removed,its certainly possible some would argue that that mechanism isnt possible because how could your genes for selfdestruction get passed on but theyre wrong heres how lets say that sometimes kids are born losers and should kill themselves the reason theyre losers is at least somewhat genetic the probability equivalent of being born a loser is like flipping tails times in a row if your genes tightly couple the amount of tails you flip and the amount of suicidal thoughts you have then if you get extremely unlucky with the coin flips then youll also kill yourself problem for the species solved populations that dont couple those two traits get beaten by those that do
Showerthoughts,removed,um maybe that person shouldnt commit a fucking crime like are we seriously normalizing crime because corporations can afford it what the fuck is wrong with you
Showerthoughts,removed,yall are stupid depression is a serious fucking mental illness i like sarah silverman do not plan to have biological children because i do not want them to inherit my illness do people whobare suicidal deserve to die no do people with serious chromosomal disorders deserve to die no because nobody deserves to die but we know that there are several points where our body does essentially hit a self destruct button if it figures out we arent developing correctly like with mutant fetuses perhaps suicide is the brain saying uh oh i am not working correctly at all better shut this shit down pronto nobody is saying depressed people shouldnt seek help for their disease and choose life id be willing to bet op is close to this issue and thats how they thought of it
Showerthoughts,removed,thats the stupidest thing ive read today
Showerthoughts,removed,leg pain at night maybe its sciatica ive dealt with it sciatica is a symptom not a diagnosis it could be the result of tight glutes or compressed discs or god forbid herniated discs in the spine if it only bothers you at night im inclined to think its the former in which case you can fix it with some yoga pigeon stretches and maybe pick up a foam roller to massage the flutes and hip flexors look it up on youtube its too hard to describe here if its the latter thats trickier sometimes it can be fixed with physical therapy but sometimes it needs surgery
Showerthoughts,removed,everyone in the uk has a local gp if you move to a new area you register with your local gp and once you feel its time for a doctors appointment you give them a call over time youll see the same doctor on a regular basis thus heshe becomes your doctor

Showerthoughts,removed,the point of feminism today is to inform people about modern sexism ableism racism etc while at the same time a majority of its members continue to disvalue people if theyre white male or cisgender thats the point of the last paragraph
Showerthoughts,removed,agreed complete pos whilst listening to all this shit is there something in the american psyche that people have to talk about exactly the same thing in a million and one threads and still have more of exactly the same to say i do think it could be down to the fact most redditors appear to have a school age mentality perhaps they think if they complain enough someone will change the result lmao i do honestly think the world is going insane the media is becoming just like facebook with the global agendas that they now try to employ its really sad and funny at the same time i am not from america and i heard a fellow brit talking the other day about how he id sat in his office and with his mentality could press the button right now lmfao didnt even understand that he doesnt take office until january then again i did see someone yesterday driving a car with an obama bumper sticker in the uk lmao i was crying at this point
Showerthoughts,removed,i disagree all are in common use it probably varies by region queen and kings still exist and are also a measurement of bed very commonly used barron and viscounts are common in europe and are also types of cookies earl and duchy are in common use in europe and in particular duchy is a brand of food that caters to the organic crowd owned by prince charles who is the duchy of cornwall

Showerthoughts,removed,i once built a database system for a very small school to replace their existing student recordkeeping system namely three word documents and an excel spreadsheet for whatever reason it was very important that the addresses be input correctly including exact and consistent spelling of the city name i decided the easiest way to do that was to just look up the name of the city from the zip code but i didnt want to take the city name field out lest i get a bunch of questions about where to type it in so after some thought i decided to just accept the city name input discard it and look it up by zip worked great

Showerthoughts,removed,speaking rationally from the perspective that words have meanings yes i agree with you however the kintype community for lack of a better term very clearly appropriates a lot of the language more traditionally associated with the subject of gender discrimination when challenged so they behave as if it is akin sic to gender even though it has nothing to do with gender at all of course what gender actually is is a bit of a moving target too but yes it is not really a gender

Showerthoughts,removed,i think it depends on how you measure greatest age i agree that globally the world hasnt been better in a long time if ever child poverty is down weve eradicated a lot of diseases and we see medical advancements every day also where it counts the most in poorer countries bill melinda gates foundation is just one of many who do great work here more people have access to education than any other point in history and the wars and conflicts today pale in comparison to other historical wars however long it lasts for now the world is mostly stable geopolitically however just because humanity seems to do fine on a global level doesnt mean that there is no cause for concern on a local level knowing that asia and africa is improving is a small consolidation when youre concerned that western democracy and economy can turn to shit at any moment global surveillance slow eradication of civil rights both in the us and europe threat of global warming the oil that will eventually run out greece italy and spains debts which threatens the whole eu partnership the immigration crisis the list goes on while none of these problems are necessarily insurmountable it does give pause to reflect and maybe it should make us a bit depressed so we start fixing it but not so depressed that we get paralyzed here at home what concerns me the most is how ignorant politicians are in technological matters plenty of laws needs to be updated to reflect the century but when they are they only take sides with larger industries or law enforcement never the individual for example due to screwed up copyright laws very soon it will become illegal to repair anything you own thanks to drmlaws like the dmca in the us it is in many cases already illegal i think a fitting allegory for the world right now would be a party bus where the passengers as a whole have a great time with a few passengers concerned about money the lend each other the bus is full of cameras and heading towards a cliff but no one knows who is driving some richer passengers think we can avoid the cliff if we sell stocks in the tire company to some of the poorer passengers one passenger claims there is no cliff but thinks the bus should move faster because its good for the economy so the world as a whole is doing fine the west im not so sure plenty of my values are under attack and im uncertain if our grandchildren will live in the same world as us

Showerthoughts,removed,im just going to put this here for those interested because it involves free cash lol so anyway there is this company oneclass that basically urges university students to pay attention in class and take notes but the best thing about it is that you literally earn cash through paypal or gift cards for starbucks best buy amazon etc that was definitely what caught my attention when you upload your notes to their servers for other students who might need them you get credits that are redeemed for cash and gift cards and when someone downloads your notes you also earn credits and you can actually upload the notes youve already taken down now to get the credits im just posting this because its literally like someone telling you to take notes in class as a job although the money is the main issue here you can also redeem your credits to download other students notes and test questions if you really need them to study the links below also it helps me get some referrals please and thank you

Showerthoughts,removed,youre telling me to kill myself no i specifically said whether you kill yourself or dont kill yourself makes zero difference if you dont like it shut up or make your own you forgot the all important third option bend others to your will because i dared to tell you that bitching about the price of pink razors is ridiculous no because your life is not worth living youre the one refusing to do anything about this perceived problem other than bitch two issues with this statement bitching is still more than you do about problems you assume bitching is all i do that is a false assumption

Showerthoughts,removed,the employer can pay you the tipped minimum as long as you make the difference in tips if you dont they have to pay you the difference
Showerthoughts,removed,ive never had a hatred more for a complete stranger than i do for you right now because of how degrading it is to address a server like that i know you mention it as a joke and hopefully dont do that but for real no offense but fuck you
Showerthoughts,removed,salty maids replying to you lmao youre correct most of them dont go beyond a smile to brighten your day and there isnt anything wrong with that but the top comment is bollocks

Showerthoughts,removed,and cheap assholes a few bitter line cooks too
Showerthoughts,removed,server here where i work i have to tip out a certain percent to the cooks barbacks bartenders and bussers its based off of how much i sell on a given night so when someone comes in and orders a bunch of shit then doesnt tip enough to cover that certain percentage i essentially paid to serve that fuckhead
Showerthoughts,removed,yet on an average week you make more than the cooks who have as much work as you do if not more they have side work they have to clean a dirty greasy kitchen they have to unload delivery trucks stock constantly while cooking make sure food is safe and put away make sure pantry is stocked and put away they work in a kitchen standing on hard tile floors and rubber mats while you walk around on carpet and air conditioning neither job is easy per se but cooking imo is far more harder half of the stuff you listed drinks bread appetizers entrees desserts alcohol is made by other people youre just playing fetch all of that stuff your complaining about having to walk from one part of a room to another a person is cranking out thousands of those items every night
Showerthoughts,removed,i want to fuck high school girls all day

Showerthoughts,removed,black is as much a race as brown is as much a race take the sentence black people are a minority okay now according to your statement if i swapped out black for brown it would no longer make sense because you declare brown isnt a race however it does work when brown is substituted because some people are in fact brown in their appearance just same goes the other way because some people are black in their appearance
Showerthoughts,removed,it wasnt until very very recently that this distinction was fabricated by relatively radical sjws and propagated by a vocal minority

Showerthoughts,removed,that is the way to go way better for you you are avoiding all the crap in processed food or huge amounts of butter or salt in restaurant food also much less expense try to imagine that you live in a world with finite resources you may very well need to live a somewhat healthy lifestyle to enjoy your later years think about the debt you most likely have and how much faster you could get out from under it by being a little more wise with your spending

Showerthoughts,removed,no you hate fast fashion not fashion you hate what has been jammed down your throat and convinced you brilliantly and effectively that there is no other option there are so many options its mind boggling you can buy made to last stuff and even high fashion at very reasonable prices if you simply do the legwork do the research and for the love of gods dont use the shitfactories of hmzaraprimark as your excuse for not doing this work this studying this research and self reflection what makes me look my best and is honest those places are pits and represent fashion the way my next crap represents the sandwich i had for lunch i have clothes that are top of the line in quality nearing ten years in age yet still looking new were bought new with tags for pennies on the retail dollar and were ethically made by well compensated insured seamsters in first world countries throughout europe but they had to be sought out and the practices of the entities involved needed to be researched which is a bit of work i know but looking sharp opens doors in your own mind and in the world a large you feel better all around you are treated to different experiences and interactions your confidence shows i think you know this last set of facts already tho and i think you might resent it dont do that fashion can be a perfectly sustainable ethical way to improve your life considerably without bankrolling slave tier manufacturing or destroying your bankroll direct your outrage at places like zara they dont employ any designers did you know that zara lives entirely by copying the work of other designers entirely it is a store for knockoffs and fields so many lawsuits every year that instead of keeping pesky creatives on hand they keep lawyers on retainer think about that that is fucked up hand made clothing woven upon a loom by a true artisan and not a machine every detail added with care not with automation quotas environmental travesties and the rest of it sewn by another craftsman in excellent conditions something that looks beautiful lasts forever doesnt exact a human toll on designers or workers or the planet there is organic cotton wool etc out there too something that you track down for next to nothing considering its value something that improves your life wtf is wrong with that thats what fashion was what its supposed to be but please dont tell me you hate food because mcdonalds is irresponsible greedy and shitty

Showerthoughts,removed,thought police
Showerthoughts,removed,i forgot reddits userbase was mostly people who would still like to have water fountains for colored
Showerthoughts,removed,police would only check your browser if they already had probably cause and a warrant at that point your history cant help to prove you innocent it can only hurt you if theres nothing in your history at all they have to link you to that internet session if you have a bunch of legitimate webpages in your history they can prove it was you at the computer for that internet session and then they just have to link that internet session to the bad pages they dont have to link you directly its a bit of a moot point anyway they would get most of the info from the isp and from logs that are out of your control wiping your history wont save you but having a history any history just makes things easier for them if you are talking about familyfriends not police then who cares if they think its suss id tell them the truth my browser has been set to wipe the history every time i close it for the last years its a relic from the old modem days where you wanted cached versions of images etc so you dont have to reload them every time you visit the page its no longer relevant anymore and only serves to trackmonitor you without giving you any benefits so why use it
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont like big beards theyre like push up bras for guys faces lies and subterfuge like what are you hiding under there weird chin weak jaw i except subtle jaw defining chris prattesque stuble but anything else might as well be a half face burqua most chicks that dig the big beard are weirdly proud of their alt tastes fetishize the manly manly brawny lumberjack man type or their father had a beard so its normalized for them
Showerthoughts,removed,doesnt mean the answer will be the same and the question commonly refers to something else so people will answer it differently based on different context you sound like the kinda guy that would ask this and when someone answer harry potter or whatever you butt in like um well actually the last thing you read was this sentence xd while the other person feels uncomfortable and leaves its a pretentious way of pretending you just tricked someone when you didnt again sorry for proving you wrong please stop talking to me youre excessive use of ellipsis makes you look like an angry child which probably isnt far off blocked troll

Showerthoughts,removed,your problem seems to be more intrinsically motivated more than anything everything you mentioned about being a software developer and the struggles it comes with it ok fine each and every one to their own but the weather its bloody amazing i personally think australia has one of the best climates to live in if youre living in one of the large cities winter is no where near as cold as america and summer can be hot but its not unbearable and theres no way australias weather reaches degrees celsius thats just plain false marriage equality legalisation of marijuana is still not a thing yet in a majority of developed countries so i dont know why youre beating australia so much for it i mean i dont exactly agree with a plebiscite but the fact that were having one is a sign of progress no internet is pretty terrible here in australia but its no where near unbearable where the hell do you live if you can get on youtube if youre lucky in broome or something current housing market and shipping costs i agree with though but honestly if living here makes you want to kill yourself arent you better off somewhere else then i dont see a better alternative i just thought id write this in case people on reddit take your exaggerated experience as everyones here in australia

Showerthoughts,removed,posts like these make me embarrassed to be on reddit
Showerthoughts,removed,respecting elders based onpy on the fact that they are more experienced and wise than yourself may not be automatic but as you get older you realize it really makes sense you are comparing a trophy for trying and losing to a trophy for living working learning failing winning helping and trying to bestow any knowledge possible sounds like someone needs to grow up a bit to have a clearer picture of what is real and what is fabricated
Showerthoughts,removed,fully illustrates why younger people are mocked you believe that respect for age is tied to intelligence and contribution its not they didnt die so their smart enough to not get themselves killed wait a few more decades and watch a dozen or so of the people you know right now die its macabre as hell i know but if your youve basically had someone with you your whole life doing their very best to make sure your stupid ass doesnt wander into oncoming trafficprotests not withstanding give it ten years up to then make a body count im now the number is right

Showerthoughts,removed,and all this while i was looking at the girl on the right shes gorgeous hello
Showerthoughts,removed,except that you are no see youre not telling people something they almost definitely already know is not informing them yeah some people might use it to inform people who may not know but im talking about another commonly used way of saying the phrase they can both exist your whole point about asking if i shout at people for saying hello because its a common way of greeting is completely meaningless because i never said that saying socially accepted and repeated things was bad i even clarified that i didnt think this youre not making the distinction between actually praying for someone in private and telling them that theyre in your thoughts and prayers telling someone that can absolutely have a positive effect on someone and i agree that prayer does nothing but i never said that it did and that has nothing to do with this post my whole point is that thoughts and prayers particularly in social media is a sympathetic phrase that shows the sufferer that you care about them and hope they get better similarly loved ones will often say get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids even though the sick person is obviously doing that because saying those things shows the sick person that you care about them and hope they get better they are both phrases that are used to show sympathy and concern mainly because drink plenty of fluids has become to many less of a literal piece of advice and rather a i care about you and this is what people say when they care phrase my copy and paste comment wasnt meant to make this seem like a bad thing and i was clear about that you seem like a jerk for many reasons your completely unwarranted rudeness comprehension skills etc but the biggest is your everyone has pointed this out please dont let this bother you any further comment seriously i get why this post could be misunderstood or disagreed with it shows in the few comments and thats why i tried to explainbut your half baked points followed by your delusional idea of everyone pointing this out and saying im wrong in my stance what a weirdly defensive thing to say in this context dudealmost nobody even saw this post i get that a few people saw it and commented that they didnt agree or understand it either but that was like a couple people man i was just trying to explain my point of view its fine if you disagree but dont project all your weird reddit insecurities on me dude
Showerthoughts,removed,this is perfect loop hello
Showerthoughts,removed,just because you dont have to do a thing doesnt mean you shouldnt do a thing
Showerthoughts,removed,i disagree in your situation there would be a mob of homeless looking people with blood dripping from their mouths walking towards clearly normal people even if one or two normal people is stupid enough to just stand there and hope they go away when the first people begin to be devoured and scream as they are eaten alive you really think the other people would just stand there too would you you think thousands of people would die in the nyc subway if a few zombies are in there you think people wouldnt catch rickyfuckingtick to the fact that these are not just homeless people because they are killing and eating people
Showerthoughts,removed,lol smelling a food is not the same as inhaling vape
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah itd be legal but then it couldnt be my secret love
Showerthoughts,removed,if it were to happen it would be self replicating nano bots controlling brainwaves they could be transferred through fluids in the body like from bites or from blood would just take one bit to take over a body through self replication

Showerthoughts,removed,terran has a small unit the vulture that can put down burrowed invisible mines if an enemy unit walks too close the mine jumps up moves toward the unit then detonates when it makes contact two mines pretty much kill a protoss unit and they do splash damage however you can target the mine while its burrowing or before it detonates in the first clip bisu the protoss player is targeting each mine or sending individual zealots to soak the hits keep in mind hes doing this while moving his units to avoid being surrounded and building more units at home
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah because it turns out that people who come up with the laws of nature actually know their shit and the truth of what they claim doesnt change over time
Showerthoughts,removed,if youd like i can copy and paste this for your money is a failure a reason to reprimand employees

Showerthoughts,removed,ah so i was right you are a tumblr bully projecting aggression where there is none other than your own ignoring things the other said and reimagining it in your own words did you score low in reading comprehension tests in school youre acting pretty textbook right now i used to study behavior patterns like yours fyi i almost certainly weigh more than you but thats not relevant even though you are going to try and make it relevant
Showerthoughts,removed,if you compare yourself with racism for being gay fuck yourself and go kill yourself youre a moron and make your entire movement look bad its those exact types that make it to where nobody takes you serious youre a clown bro just relax nobody cares what your period feels like right now just eat some cotton candy and chill to some charles bronson movies or some shit damn
Showerthoughts,removed,your argument is null and void and you no longer qualify to speak to becuase you deny reality we have the same exact rights equality whether you call it perversion or mental health problem or how im born it doesnt change youre just an egotistical maniac who is most likely more so than not a sociopath and you make even more of a deal over nothing than women which is why we dont like you we can barely deal with women now you want us to deal with men who are half as soft give me a fucking break and grow a pair buddy shut up for once and deal with it instead of bitching about how everyone else cant

Showerthoughts,removed,no kids must retain enough information so they may regurgitate it on sate exams so that the school district can obtain more funding
Showerthoughts,removed,yes but blacks even though only making up of the population commit of violent crimes in america this means that white people are committing less violent crime yet being killed at double the rate it is therefore logical that blacks will feature far more than whites in any negative interactions with the police—yet despite this a larger number of whites are killed by the police than any other racial group
Showerthoughts,removed,my school has a policy to assign hours of homework per class per night minus my stem class which is daily i have seven classes with four periods a daystem is daily so homework is due every other day so in total i have six hours of homework per night on a good day with ap classes usually assigning more i was a straight a student in middle school now a senior i have a b average

Showerthoughts,removed,i have no problem with advertising in general i dont think some shit website that creates content so boring that people arent prepared to pay to consume it is viable just because they exploit genuine businesses desires for more customers advertising in general is fine i want to know what specials are on at the shops near me i want to know when new product lines from places i regularly buy are available if that was what advertising was and once it presented the ad to me it fucked off id be all for ads i couldnt give a shit about the revenue stream for some shitty website i had accidentally clicked on i also couldnt care less about coca cola or mcdonalds or where to buy the very best carpet cleaner or how to grow my penis with magic beans or how to find women for sex near me or whatever those ads say i certainly dont want those ads repeatedly presenting themselves to me

Showerthoughts,removed,at least in my country its required by law to storage for at least years everything from security footage to a receipt of the guy who bought a single water bottle
Showerthoughts,removed,and a liability how much more resources are used when theres a wreck especially with death or injuries but the real answer is image is not much data to store continuous video is a lot of data
Showerthoughts,removed,ive got places to be this isnt a frequent practice but if im sitting at a red light with zero cross traffic and a clean field of view im going the traffic lights arent adjusting according to traffic flow and the city has pure disregard for citizens stuck in traffic and stopped at needless lights the real question is why arent you running them its your time take it back

Showerthoughts,removed,security camera tech is all the way where it needs to be and then some its the affordability of it that restricts quality most security cameras now can record to at least at what you see on the news is usually closer to fps fuzzy vision because recording video at the equipments max fidelity chews up drive space like a comcast dvr only you dont record your favorite hours of cctv footage each day youre recording dvr when your disk fills up it goes back to the beginning and starts overwriting whatevers there however long filling up that disk takes determines your playback retention time higher definiton more disk space per second less video that can fit on the disk even with a drive youll have to compromise between archived video retention time and recorded video quality small banks gas stations and small stores etc often use what are called edge devices these things are usually allinone boxes that handle the video mgmt and you just networkin cameras to it they have fixed storage capacity that cant be increased sorry that was way more info than anyone asked for ill see myself out
Showerthoughts,removed,i loled on a buzzkill note its because of storage not the cameras red light cameras only store one image every time someone activates it security footage has to record and store video usually from multiple angles
Showerthoughts,removed,umits worth it so we dont have robbers on the loosedipshit
Showerthoughts,removed,the its genetic claim is a strawman set up by homophobes because its easy to disprove as you did most scientific studies point to what youre attracted to being determined by brain structures that take on different forms depending on hormonal balances during fetal development its pretty much entirely random and not based on heritage
Showerthoughts,removed,i watched a tedx talk yesterday guy said that unusually high stress during pregnancy can trigger a homosexual child being born he also said the same thing if it were just a random defect it would have been bred out by now but its persistent in humans and many animal species he showed some statistics that show homosexuals are typically more intelligent and emotionally in touch than heterosexuals it was also proposed that homosexuality could be some type of natural birth control as each male child born before another preexposes the child for homosexuality by so first son probably wont be gay but by the third or fourth chances are they will be thus preventing family groups from producing too many childrengrandchildren to feed

Showerthoughts,removed,please name a company that was willing to throw per computer back in the late just for a display when they could buy the cheapest commodity nonnamebrand monitor available though more likely than not were dell monitors most monitors even if it was capable of being driven at that were typically operated anywhere between to usually a high monitor maximum resolution is completely useless if the video card and storage medium where the video would be stored were incapable of higher resolution and high resolution is not particularly readable with a crt crts were fairly rare why do you think it took so long for machines to get off windows xp businesses bought as cheap hardware as they could operate with anything more is just wasted capital spending
Showerthoughts,removed,youve got a point fuck this gay earth
Showerthoughts,removed,because the white people were never enslaved white people stayed the majority in power all through american history hence the term white is nlt perceived to be negative even the racist term for white people that black people use cracker doesnt hold the same weight as the other way round ngga thankfully usage of the word black is getting better and the negative connotation is slowly going away but because of this double standard to racism there are seriously black people who truly believe that all white people are racist and that black people absolutely cannot be racist no matter how much hate speech of whites they say as for how to fix this i honestly have no idea when people like that continue to exist i grew up in a country where any public hate speech targeted at another race is immediately punished for example a chinese lady criticised a muslim wedding in her neighbourhood for being loud and a nuisance and told them to take their weddings elsewhere she was immediately shit on on facebook and lost her job singapore takes racial harmony pretty seriously

Showerthoughts,removed,getting brought to america as slaves is hands down the greatest thing to ever happen to black people im dead serious in fact im basing this on a conversation i had recently with an african man who pointed out to me that american blacks have lives most people in subsaharan africa could only dream of having but take it completely for granted had their ancestors simply stayed in western africa theyd be living lives like that of the average villager in western african countrieslittle to no medicine limited electricity limited education and in many cases limited access to something as simple as clean drinking water getting raped by white men is ironically the best thing to ever happen to africanamerican women it raised the iq of the black gene pool in america by at least points and there is overwhelming scientific evidence to support this this is completely ignoring affirmative action white guilt and all the other things that give black americans outstanding privilege its also worth noting that black americans are the beneficiaries of an ad hoc eugenics program where only the strongest slaves were in high demand and of those slaves only the strongest survived the trip to america from there only the strongest were selected to breed and have many slave children without slavery we wouldnt see black athletes in the nba nfl etc slavery was a godsend for black people

Showerthoughts,removed,but women get raped if we care about violence as much as sex we might recognize that men are just as likely to be the victim of a violent crime as women and that theres absolutely nothing special about a woman being victimized conversations must first and foremost remain about the poor womyns hence why were okay with violence in general and so uptight about sex

Showerthoughts,removed,you dont just get arrested because you try to use counterfeit money they might be able to search your house for counterfeiting paraphernalia though
Showerthoughts,removed,actually in this case you can just go to the bk manager and say i found an envelope full of cash if someone comes and claims it here is my phone then if they can say roughly how much is in there you give it back to them theres a nonzero chance they come back looking for it

Showerthoughts,removed,ill use personality disorder or borderline personality disorder or any other social diagnosis i care to when describing the destructive manipulative behaviour of individuals who use emotional blackmail and feign the symptoms of serious mental illness if youve got a problem with that you can go talk to other people with your issues about it except like me you will probably find that theres nothing more insufferable than a group of people complaining about their fucking mindscape chaos you think youve got problems a visit to the er is a drop in the bucket for people who have bigger problems than connecting to others so no your worst sounds pretty basic to me im not really interested in your personal social justice crusade the only point of it is so you can search out opportunities to get outraged also i live in vancouver not the hood you fucking racist also eta means estimated time of arrival

Showerthoughts,removed,youve failed stop asking dumbass questions you heard on reddit a month ago trying to sound smart
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,what there is no we or free will without something being in existence in the first place
Showerthoughts,removed,i mean god thinks a lot of things are bad theyre called sins you have free will thats the entire point you can make fucked up choices if you want or you can not make fucked up choices what part of this isnt free will if you didnt have free will youd be unable to kill yourself this is not the case
Showerthoughts,removed,i still dont understand what youre saying you have the right to exercise this free will you can kill yourself right now just like you can go out and murder a stranger free will doesnt mean you can do anything you want to and nobody will judge you for it
Showerthoughts,removed,embrace the meme
Showerthoughts,removed,the law doesnt give you the right to murder anyone yet you can still do it and no one and nothing can stop you yes like suicide like robbing people or any other number of affronts against god and man im not arguing about the ability to kill ones self but about religious beliefs on the consequences of committing this sin that can have really bad effect on a society what i think the problem here is that youre not sure what youre talking about im not sure youre really familiar with religion but about religious beliefs on the consequences of committing this sin that can have really bad effect on a society the religious beliefs that say that suicide is a sin what consequences the disapproval of god what do you mean bad effect on society and what does that have to do with free will
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,with all due respect i think its you who missed my point by taking it too literally no i think i understood your point it was just a faulty one no offense there are lots of things that are considered sinful its not except on a teeny tiny matter our lives there are a ton of things you will judged for by others and supposedly god why is suicide the exception to free will and your interpretation of free will not being judged suffering people who want to end their lives and might choose to prolong their misery because instead of judging it as a moral right religion condemns it yeah a lot of people condemn it suicide isnt generally approved of by society even society without religion you used an example of someone suffering sure there are lots of highschool kids suffering through depression you support them killing themselves cool i dont but anyway youre saying what if someone that wants to die chooses not to kill themselves because its a sin so what what does that have to do with free will religion condemns suicide christianity does condemn is a pretty harsh word for it its not like the bible says if you kill yourself you go straight to hell i think maybe thats what youre confused about in any case youre definitely confused about something no
Showerthoughts,removed,ok so were both in agreement that what your title really means is suicide is considered a sin but i feel that it should not be considered a sin because what you actually said means something else entirely
Showerthoughts,removed,its black guys that are lazy

Showerthoughts,removed,how to make money everyday online tricks
Showerthoughts,removed,i hate women thats it thats the extent of their value but do you ever see them acknowledge this no its all i want to be treated like an equal conveniently ignoring how we men routinely destroy our equals through the crucible of intramale competition do you see women bowing down and thanking men for forging civilization through work and warfare carving out territory for humanity through our strength of arms mastering sabertooths genociding neanderthals and native americans so women can have a nice safe place to sew and pad around barefoot do you ever hear a word of gratitude out of their wanton chadcocksucking lips no no you do not instead its all male privilege bla bla if any woman here had an ounce of honesty she would immediately break down sobbing uncontrollably at this travesty the utter disrespect men have gotten in return for our noble treatment of women she would be overcome with shame at the actions of her gender and pull her hair out tear her clothes wail and beat the earth did you ever see a group of women take up arms and fight for the freedoms they claim to want no no you dont instead women manipulate and work through men they emotionally abuse they guilt trip and they whine like little bitches until they get what they want women should be prostrating themselves and giving free handjobs and blowjobs to every productive male to cross her path out of sheer thankfulness for us letting them live in the society we built instead what do we see out of women voting to let in savages who openly state their intention to revoke the rights we men so foolishly handed to women demanding equal representation at the highest levels while continuing to trod all over men who are lower than them demanding jobs at the highest levels despite having measurably inferior brains and capabilities having frail bodies that pregnancy and pms routinely put out of commission and having lower genetic variability thus greater mediocrity demanding that companies and laws and society and culture treat them better while simultaneously refusing to go create their own companies and laws and cultures where they can set their own rules because deep down they know they cant being complete hypocrits most of the time who refuse to acknowledge any of this about themselves continually portraying themselves as victims when in fact women have always bent society and men to their whims in short fuck women fuck women and everything they saydo their place is raising kids producing milk and keeping things clean thats it every other activity or area of life we have let them partake in they have fucked up back to where you belong ladies i could go on but hopefully this all serves as a decent starting point for fruitful discussion

Showerthoughts,removed,wtf is wrong with the people in this thread omg
Showerthoughts,removed,i have anger issues apparently nobody wants to associate themselves with me because of it i cant explain it ive never been violent
Showerthoughts,removed,there is evolutionary basis for attraction men seek women with big hips breasts symmetrical face not sick looking not crippled all things that suggest offspring will be healthy and taken care of women seek strong men high confidence able to produce a safe environment for offspring yes there are millions of cases where this isnt true but there are billions of cases where it is true if not biological reasons then you have society putting immense pressure on the youth women are told to marry before men are told to work hard at work so they can support a family half of the population has their first marriage before age all things being perfect the pool of date able people is gone or highly damaged by age that is either they failed the first time or failed to find the first time again just the way the law of averages works ok so you disagree with all of the above how about the fact that i cant actually control who i find attractive you wouldnt give a gay guy shit for being attracted to guys maybe you would i will never find a woman who weighs more than me attractive or if she has kids i just lose all attraction to her its not fair to other people and maybe it means i too die alone like the rest of this thread but to deny who i am inside when my inaction hurts no one is to live a wasted life
Showerthoughts,removed,nope you made me tap on my breaks because you kinda cut me off you obviously deserve to die and burn in hell for eternity

Showerthoughts,removed,dont worry life is what it is everyones story has some fucked up parts being close to forty beats the shit out of not making it that far dating is just a thing people do or dont im finding that basically nobody gives a shit about the stupid things the people who do are the ones to avoid age seems to scrub off all the sharp edges if its not a total disaster its not worth getting totally worked up about things change but really they dont change that much youll be awesome if you let yourself be
Showerthoughts,removed,bullshit being a single parent means that you make poor fucking decisions that you cant handle being in a relationship that requires work and sacrifice being divorced doubly so if you cant make good decisions then that means someone else has to pick up the slack for you i am not in the business of repairing mistakes that others make in their life the only person that sucks is you asshead
Showerthoughts,removed,this is how i feel too i dont like bothering people and i hate mindless small talk so if i see someone i work with at work i wont say anything unless they do first most of the time i can escape without them seeing me
Showerthoughts,removed,im and dating a year old a very small super young looking at that i didnt see her and think oh look jail bait i met her in real time she was clever and funny laughed at me flirting only after being with her for a while did i start to get looks and jokes all the robbing the cradle and oh you like e young shit really got annoying almost called it off with her untili realized she was getting the same type of nonsense from her peers we said fuck it and made sexy sexy time and walk around like the beautiful people we are
Showerthoughts,removed,i never mentioned money in my post although money is certainly part of the issue it is only one small part having a kid would ruin my life if i had a solid budget for it we need to stop trying to act like monetary reasons are the only reasons people shouldnt have kids there have been more than enough confessions from people who regret having kids and are miserable because of it theres this whole message that people try to spread that its different when its your own kid and the fact is that its not always different people should not be trying to convince others that having kids is great when the others have specifically stated that they dont want kids wed probably be a lot better off where it wasnt thought of as weird or wrong for people to not want kids kids would absolutely ruin my life because being a good parent is incompatible with the life i want to live i dont want to raise a child and dedicate a massive amount of time effort money patience etc for two or more decades towards it i have enough money to care for a child and i wish people like you would stop spreading the myth that moneys the only way for a child to ruin your life
Showerthoughts,removed,thats fair i was just saying that the situation of others has bearing on yours yes people should quit dwelling on bad things but the fact that someone may have it worse what ever that even means isnt really relevant
Showerthoughts,removed,well yea because books and articles are subject to more of a review process than wikipedia edits httpbrunomarsusrumorcomebrunomarsgay sometimes books and articles are peer reviewed sometimes not there is no talk section for books so you cant see what kind of controversy is going on around that the last time you saw a book cited in your history book did you check to see if that authors works havent been debunked you cant change a book after its been published how do you know its still accurate wikipedia is more immediately changeable than any other reliable source of information out there and it has many more eyes on it this is both a blessing and a curse

Showerthoughts,removed,yes there are more colors than we see but because our eyes and brains evolved to only process a certain spectrum those are the only colors well ever personally observe a cybernetic eye could capture ultraviolet but it would either have to be converted into a false color for our brains to process the input or our brains would automatically perceive the input as a color it already understood mainly we would just observe additional detail in things that are normally hidden similar to a greenred colorblind person missing the letter y in a lost in the colored swatches of vision test

Showerthoughts,removed,thats the effect of no quota which used to be the norm for any internet service even cellular little by little cell phone companies tried to see what happened when introducing quotas no customer batted an eyelash and so it quickly became the norm so much so that even dslcablefiber companies started doing the same thing the exact same phenomenom is going on with privacy where companies push the envelope further everyday and realize no one cares so it becomes a new norm
Showerthoughts,removed,thats right karma is awesome to me
Showerthoughts,removed,technically the city and state officials regulate the enforcement of the code permit the building for construction inspection the building regularly but there are places where those officials care more about one piece of code than another for example ive had elevator sump pumps not included in projects with electric traction elevators until this year but now every elevator needs a pump or it wont be passed this is afaik because the elevator inspector is about to retire and is training his replacement on all the things that need to be done you typically get older folks who are a lot more lenient with different facets of construction because they know what meets the spirit of the code and what is extraneous but after a building is built and occupied people using the building can sue if they get injured and something was not to code i dont know a ton about the different groups that do it but i know that people do for example the american with disabilities act if an ada residential unit does not meet code there are some sorts of legal steps that can be taken not my area of expertise but ive heard from other folks in the industry that it does happen
Showerthoughts,removed,they arent stupid they are smart in not taking it how many people would by an xbox at the time tons no questions asked especially if it was right after launch or right after the xone came out how would tske trade in credit with tons and tons of random dvds every single pawn shop used electronics store etc who would take a guitar that is worth pawn shops dont want unmovable stuff and while its probably worth that to a person into music and especially guitar its not for a random kid trying to learn therefore making it a hard sale not to mention pretty uncommon and easy to track down they want things that are small and easy to carry and movesell or expensive things that happen to be big but are really easy to sell as well like tvs

Showerthoughts,removed,sacrifice the destruction or surrender of something for the sake of something else that is one of the definitions given nothing about the greater good self sacrifice has always been seen as non suicidal especially by the church who really are the only people who seem to care if you kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,as someone who has done a lot of digital forensics investigations for credit card breaches the vast majority of the guys doing this on a larger scale dont get caught because theyre in russia we have no extradition treaty with russia and honestly the russian government doesnt really care what happens to our financial institutions so its mostly a free ride on their part its easy money too most places have abysmal security protecting their pointofsales pos systems generally not their fault though most places hire an outside firm to set these things up because theyre not very technical themselves i mean if you want to make sandwiches youre going to worry about the sandwiches and pay someone else to worry about the technology which often gets implemented very very poorly but a hacker can easily gain access install a key logger or ram scraper and if the business gets unique credit or debit cards they can then sell the track data the stuff on the mag stripe for each thats a day pretty easy money and like i said if youre russia and stay in russia youre not going to get busted ive actually sat in on presentations given by the usss and its fascinating the level of intel they have on these guys and the lengths they have to go through to try and make an arrest its generally a big howdoyoudo involving foreign law enforcement or interpol to get an arrest made or theyll trick them to coming to new york or catch them while on a lay over in a country we can pick them up in there were a couple of guys that were responsible for a lot of hacks on subway restaurants and they tricked them to coming to the us claiming they won some free prize true story all that being said dont ever do anything malicious inside the united states they will catch you it doesnt matter how many proxies you are behind if youre messing with money in the us you will get caught
Showerthoughts,removed,thats the only reason you dont do it wtf is wrong with the world maybe just op
Showerthoughts,removed,another compulsive liar cops wouldnt be able to just use your work to arrest her they have to collect their own evidence secondly even calling your credit card company would immediately or at the very slowest business days get you your money back as is federally mandated in the case of credit cad fraud third a bank branch closing would have no impact even remotely on how a bank would handle your case i mean did you even try to come up with a believable lie although apparently you dont even need to for reddit
Showerthoughts,removed,oh yeah this thread some empiric observations because race mixing is a perfect way to fuck up your kids sense of identity mixed people especially kids generally have no subconscious peer ingroups in a sense the nonmixed do appearance matters in human tribalism
Showerthoughts,removed,oh dont get me wrong i think most laws are morally good and thanks good theyre here with someone to reinforce them however as someone else said its a benefitcost ratio maybe you would do something if the cost would be just knowing you did something bad but you wont do that same thing if the cost becomes knowing you did something bad and risking going to jail paying a fine my point is that without the risk of going to jailpaying a fine the benefits cost ratio for most crimes would be high enough for most people to become criminals basically i think that if laws werent enforced crime both violent and not violent would increase tenfold at the very least
Showerthoughts,removed,not at all true
Showerthoughts,removed,but dont forget that zoos serve important functions not only do they provide valuable research opportunities for us to know more about animals and ecosystems in the wild which may let us save them from ourselves but they are also populations protected from natural thats too existence like disease dramatic habitat alteration etc plus all the kids at zoos today are learning to appreciate and love animals when they get older they can support policies that favor animal rights over economic development the tragedy of animals caged in zoos may just be preventing much greater tragedies out in the world

Showerthoughts,removed,there is a difference between and many other wars for example saw europe and other parts of the world resisting invasion by the axis powers defeating hitler and the nazis that was a war where the noble fought and died for what was right however was a war between stagnating empires each more concerned with their own wants and fucking over anyone necessary to achieve their goals including their own soldiers the powers of the entente france britain etc were actually quite bad at this the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikinivelleoffensive is a stark reminder of this as is the fact that the british cut a majority of german communications to the united states meaning all the americans knew of the war was gained from the heavily biased and censored british media also the us president at the time woodrow wilson was a member of the ku klux klan the central powers at least had a reason to fight their archduke was assassinated austriahungary declared war on serbia and soon everyone was dragged in because of the complex web of alliances that had been forged germany was ultimately blamed for the war despite it being austrias fault and was forced to pay reparations for the war putting them in a severe financial crisis right after the war only made worse during the great depression in the really a lot of germanys problems are austrias fault after all hitler was austrian yet germany gets full blame austria remains unknown to some people

Showerthoughts,removed,i know nothing of the science but by my logic and best guess i think that the earth does not slow rotation speed unless there is something to stop it a few examples i can give is ● a rocket being fired or anything on the earth moving around in such a way •mind you this is miniscule and would barely move the entirety of the planet more than a molecule or less of position or speed but rockets tend to fire opposite of earths rotation due to the easiness of flying or so ive been told ● an asteroid or meteorological stuff hitting the planet • im sure for this size is relative to impact and how much it moves us • the direction it comes from would make the angle or rotation changes vary • still miniscule effect unless huge ● gravity of another planet or large thing in space •iunno how to explain this since i am not science nor do i do science but basically of a bigg ass planet makes the earth wanna not rotate around the sun seasonal rotation then the daily rotations would also vary and change and stuff note i am not science man nor do i know much science this is just stuff i learn in grade and put together from memory and logic i love you goodnight

Showerthoughts,removed,i believe children are not a human right its a privilege you already get that privilege taken away if you beat or abuse your children it absolutely boggles the mind that their arent preventative measures in place to protect children before they are born into a bad family a vast amount of human suffering comes from children who are raised in bad homes there needs to be rigorous guidelines you must pass before you are allowed to raise children this would vastly improve the world pedophile think child abuse is okay would impart bigoted ideas or profoundly scientifically illiterate ideas into your childs head have aspd are a prolific alcoholic would butcher a baby boys genitals force your child to be part of your religion deny them a good science education too bad settle for a nice goldfish there also needs to be mandatory classes for all prospective parents to teach them how to raise children in a safe loving environment im incredibly sick of this idea that babies and children are prepeople and not really deserving of the same human rights everyone else gets to enjoy and the implicit societal agreement that its fine for anyone who wants to make a kid to make one and if its a horrible abusive family well thats unfortunate well save your kid after the damage has been done we need to take legislative steps to protect people from being raised in horrible environments

Showerthoughts,removed,its a beautiful thing people can rightfully argue that sites like reddit and other online collections of us humans and our content like say facebook for example are blackholes of time and and productivity but at least reddit provides some true original creative thought and insight and solid cat gifs from time to time reddit also doesnt make me hate the people i know irl thats big you can chalk disagreements up to random assholes on the internet instead of your neighbor bon your grade classmate george crazy aunt betty and your best friend from middle school facebook posts are literally like shouting your opinion in time square surrounded by your family and everyone youve ever met for longer than seconds not always a bad thing but its a certainly a thing its sorta like a virtual wall mart with out the physical and psychological trauma and the smells associated god help us when vr goes mainstream
Showerthoughts,removed,and not using the search to find the httpswwwredditcomrshowerthoughtssearchqelastigirlbirthrestrictsronsortrelevancetall ohttpswwwredditcomrshowerthoughtssearchqelastigirlchildbirthrestrictsronsortrelevancetall shttpswwwredditcomrshowerthoughtssearchqincrediblechildbirthrestrictsronsortrelevancetallthttpswwwredditcomrshowerthoughtssearchqincrediblechildbirthrestrictsronsortrelevancetall ahttpswwwredditcomrshowerthoughtssearchqelastibirthrestrictsronsortrelevancetall the exact same thing was probably a piece of cake for you jokes aside people get tired of having the same showerthoughts recycled every week at least use the search bar before you post to make sure that your post isnt a repost of one of the top showerthoughts have a great day

Showerthoughts,removed,i think you are misinterpreting the point because youre a dumb cunt
Showerthoughts,removed,he didnt say anything to asinine he said it to papazander

Showerthoughts,removed,🎺🎺🎺🎺
Showerthoughts,removed,picture the following scenario for a moment youre a middleaged man living in the suburbs with your wife and youve been having an affair for months with your neighbors teenage daughter for the past few weeks youve been concerned about your wifes behavior it has now come to a point where youre actually starting to think she may suspect something so what can a cheater like you do to avoid a painful divorce well of course you could stop seeing the girl but even if you stopped the affair now and lets face it you have no intention of giving her up you could still get in trouble for starting it in the first place or maybe you could be upfront and tell your wife everything about it hoping that she could forgive you but do you really want to put your life in her hands im sure you dont so what can you actually do well in this scenario lets assume that your wife is crazy about gardening and particularly about her roses she spends countless hours each week shopping for new ones planting her latest acquisitions and caring for them now what would happen if say every week in the dead of night something happened to those roses for example on week they could be torn by their roots and scattered around your lovely front garden on week they could catch fire on week snip snip there go their flowers and so on and so on let me tell you what would happen in this fictional scenario your wife would divert all of her attention to the mysterious case of the rose killer for hours she would look for possible culprits try to devise ways to catch that person in the act or come up with all sorts of methods to try to keep her roses out of reach from that mysterious person in the meantime your teenage neighbor would completely disappear off her radar mission accomplished your fictional self is now free to resume his illicit dalliance this was a fictional scenario but this is how they work

Showerthoughts,removed,you can kill yourself before you die in those moments there is room for regret
Showerthoughts,removed,neverforget neverforget
Showerthoughts,removed,riamverysmart
Showerthoughts,removed,do i need to explain the difference between suggesting that if you willingly text and drive that you deserve to die versus advocating killing people we find guilty of texting and driving no legal system is sound and errorproof enough that i would ever suggest actually instituting a death penalty for anything except the most heinous of crimes but at the same time upon finding out someone texted while driving and it resulted in killing themselves and nobody else i cant help but think well thats good
Showerthoughts,removed,oh my sweet summer child
Showerthoughts,removed,httpmesymessbookro
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,sorry this turned into a bit of an essay i think the issue is finding a bank whose parent company has no ties to the us as well i am not a lawyer but i believe if you were caught the irs might see this as willful and really whack you with huge fines it is true that some countries are still rolling out fatca and and others moved quickly to cut out middle class americans who were too much trouble some expats are having a terrible time because of course they have swiss bank accounts which sounds suspicious until you realize they actually live in switzerland some people are saying they had kids overseas and the kid who they didnt register with the state department has a local bank account and the kid they did register doesnt of course not all americans living and working overseas have dual citizenship and many places now make you confirm that you have no ties to the us if you have a us birth place on your nonus passport which you need to open a new account they will ask you for a certificate of loss of nationality to prove that you really are not a us citizen anymore that takes time and money to get on top of actually renouncing in addition to the waiting times and fees related to seeking a second citizenship if your country even offers citizenship to people in your situation i think the issue youd run into is that its not just banks but also credit unions insurance companies investments pensionstheres an article on in here
Showerthoughts,removed,i jackoff and wipe my ass with my left hand and shake hands with my right hand so nah bro its because something about hearing the middle eastern people do it as they get their right hands chopped off from stealing so they try not to steal otherwise they have to eatshake hands with the hand they use to wipe their asses with after i heard that shit i was like god damn maybe they aint savages after all and started copying them

Showerthoughts,removed,it may seems like insults but it is pure fact you claim black lives matter is the single biggest threat to america you claim that we are close to a civil war over it this has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt you are stupid and againid like to see what leads you to believe this so from what you last said you believe certain state officials are extremely close to being blackmailed into starting succeeding from the nation and then declaring war sowhich states and its clear you have some kind of inside information here so who are these extremely high powered members of black lives matter who are in position to blackmail state officials into declaring war on the rest of the country and on top of thatwhat information could they possibly have what could be so bad in a politicians past that that would literally have their state declare war on the rest of the country to keep it quite

Showerthoughts,removed,and thats my hometown
Showerthoughts,removed,its never ok to criticize someones body naturally skinny women get it worse than men because there are a lot of implications of eating disorders not to mention the aggression that thicker women sometimes have for skinny women i dont think its just as bad to criticize skinny folks the social stigma just isnt the same but its still very very shitty
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah wtf zoos do we seriously need to watch animals in real life that bad how about a documentary on television im really wondering if zoos should be legal
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont think youre understanding that the inherent moral value of a zoo being proposed here is that the education research rehabilitation and advocacy that zoos create can even help save even the wild species from extinction ill add that zoos generally dont take wild animals from a place without some sort of reasoning grounded in conservation mistreatedinjuredoversocialized animals and are often housing animals that cannot be released into the wild through no fault of the zoo itself
Showerthoughts,removed,not all zoos are aza accredited and if you consider a roadside zoo a zoo then most zoos are probably shit

Showerthoughts,removed,i have been smirking and smiling on millennial jokes all the time until this comment when i realised im a millenial too almost so technically when i laughed on millennial jokes i was laughing on centennials huh millennials are fools hence proved
Showerthoughts,removed,most users dont not just most millennials most people thats why its a specialty field that isnt required to know in order to use computers this is like complaining that most people dont know how to rewire their houses were we supposed to take an electrical engineering course before buying our house were we supposed to take computer hardware and software maintenance before buying our lenova yogas
Showerthoughts,removed,i could go for some movies told more from the perspective of the villain

Showerthoughts,removed,age doesnt really even factor into the equation except it does in fact its one of the most obvious indicators of tech competency
Showerthoughts,removed,if you didnt have those aches when you were younger and you due now that you are older isnt it reasonable to assume the only changing factor is your age no firstly because youre talking hypothetically so its pretty meaningless to start with secondly because theres nothing you get that you didnt have when you were younger unless you were born with it so such moronic and dumb logic would lead you to decide that everything is caused by age also please contract crippling arthritis in your hands so you can no longer type youre a useless dumb shit stain now thats punishment enough i suppose
Showerthoughts,removed,im and working in it and i know my shit but i feel like i just walked into a rival gangs bar because you assume youre correct literally anything but i know my shit would be better the vast majority of missed out on a whole lot of foundation knowledge that really isnt being included in the modern baseline
Showerthoughts,removed,anything with an x on the end is fucking epic better name then the others
Showerthoughts,removed,you are a piece of shit
Showerthoughts,removed,i think the majority of millennials are busy playing candy crush and snap chatting not knowing how their magical devices work i think they give millennials too much credit by using the small smart minority to represent all millennials i mean i cant even get any of my sisters to develop the simple habit of letting their phones charge while they are asleep i dont know how they go through life never having a full batteryever
Showerthoughts,removed,i want to punch you in the face just for typing right millennials suck
Showerthoughts,removed,the old excuse for not knowing how to use computers is just a deflection i mean unless theyre intelligent older people with problem solving skills can figure out computers its not reasonable to literally live through the entire age that computers have been relevant to consumers and have them escape you youre youve lived through one of the most significant human inventions and watched it mold the world around you and youre telling me you didnt take enough interest in it to figure out how to hook up your internet
Showerthoughts,removed,millennials wouldnt be able to find my computer if it jumped on their shoulder and screamed im a computer in their ear things like a terminal monitor keyboard mouse external harddrive are artifacts from ancient civilisations to them
Showerthoughts,removed,and his son being a tool
Showerthoughts,removed,is still a millennial it is not are generation x are millennials generation z are
Showerthoughts,removed,and everyone in older generation knows how computer works what the hell am i reading everyone in this thread acts like specific knowledge needed to know how computers work applies to everyone its not like its a field of study that only a small part of population chooses to learn i sorted comments by controversy and cant believe how retarded these arguments are

Showerthoughts,removed,ehhh maybe not enough to make the sea level technically rise you would think that the sea level would at most rise exactly the amount of the water your finger would displace when you dip it in but your milk is contained in a small cup with defined vertical edges and dipping your cookie pushes down and displaces some of the milk causing the level of milk to visibly rise in the cup the sea is massive and its containers edges are not as vertical or exact as a cup so a slight rise wouldnt be as easy to see also the scale of things are way offa cookie is much closer in size to a small cup of milk than a finger is to the huge amount of water in the sea if you split a hair several times and dipped that tiny sliver of hair into your milk the rise would me microscopic also your milk is just sitting there otherwise unchanged the sea has tides the water doent sit still there are waves all the time its full of life fish other creatures doing whatever they do seaweed and algae are doing their photosynthesis business people are swimming boating and a bunch more stuff its probably raining somewhere over the sea and the sun is helping evaporating some of the sea water too you arent doing much to water level by fingering the sea

Showerthoughts,removed,ya get off your lazy butt and start brainstorming the best way to kill yourself you have been putting it off to long its like you dont even want to die
Showerthoughts,removed,thats more true than you realize my abnormal psychology professor said that the reason many antidepression medications sometimes have suicide as a side effect is because the depression can sap your motivation so much you never kill yourself but when the medication kicks in it relieves the symptoms just enough so you find that motivation and do the deed

Showerthoughts,removed,and this is different from usa how poor drunk and high people everywhere financial cartels running the government and having almost half the country live below poverty line and while the water may not be so bad everywhere nestlé and other corporations are allowed to create water shortages biggest polluter on the planet which your nationalist candidates never acknowledge let alone believe in or plan to change wooohoo california youre just proving my point by coasting on the oncetrue greatest nation on the planet title achieved by your grandparents generation if you want anecdotal strawman arguments i come from norway arguably not very nationalistic society and we arent doing all too poorly
Showerthoughts,removed,my friend open legs of your wife right now young tight pussy
Showerthoughts,removed,i am not saying you are equally bad to centralamerica but your original post insinuated that nationalism is good because they dont have it in centralamerica and look how awful it is there my point is there are plenty of other countries who do not suffer from nationalism either such as norway and we are doing really well so to argue that to forsake nationalism is to invite poverty crime and health maladies is a straw man argument and to claim that you wont be poor in america based solely on your decisions is highly incorrect if i were to indulge you in that statement i would argue that your educational system doesnt fully prepare people in all levels of society when it comes to proper decision making processes and critical thinking skills this especially applies to inner city low income areas where many dont even complete high school usually due to reasons of poverty and crime and not laziness or simply poor decisions if you were correct about it being that simple it would also mean that your social mobility is a lot better than it is low social mobility indicates that if you are born into poverty you are statistically more like to remain poor throughout your entire life than actually move up no matter what you decide to do thats the whole meaning of social mobility as an indicator to show well the respective society is accommodated for taking care of everyone not just a lucky few
Showerthoughts,removed,youre confusing nationalism with sense of community definition of nationalism is a feeling that people have of being loyal to and proud of their country often with the belief that it is better and more important than other countries sense of community there are four elements of sense of community membership boundaries emotional safety a sense of belonging and identification personal investment a common symbol system influence members need to feel that they have some influence in the group integration and fulfillment of needs members feel rewarded in some way for their participation in the community and shared emotional connection the definitive element for true community it includes shared history and shared participation or at least identification with the history what you are referring to as a good thing is the latter not the former
Showerthoughts,removed,hunt for in next doortits for jerk off
Showerthoughts,removed,your country is a direct result of globalism although on a slower and less automated scale than what we have today northkorea china and germany are some prime examples of nationalism gone one step too far the continual import of skilled labour axis scientists during and after the war for example is one of the prime reasons why you guys became the behemoth nation your grandparents made you one of the few reasons why you have managed to maintain that position ironically enough considering your post is globalization globalization is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views products ideas and other aspects of culture advances in transportation and technology such as steam locomotivesjet enginescontainer ships and internetmobile phones has allowed and forced inevitably interdependence of of both economic and cultural activities you have to remember globalization isnt just about the migration and movement of people that is one of the most obvious aspects admittedly as countries that once were mostly homogenous in things like skin color and religion are now anything but you also have to remember the globalization involves trade and transactions buying and selling of physical goods and products across borders importexport capital and investment movements digital money zooming back and forth online as opposed to heavy physical coin notes and commodities and dissemination of knowledge what you and i are currently engaged in all of this would be impossible without globalization with nationalism in the drivers seat i have no idea where your ancestors came from but unless you are native american you wouldnt even be born if it wasnt for globalization you see when people are just handed everything without having to fight for it they take it for granted become entitled you can easily verify this by spending a few weeks hanging out at wasp high schools hunter is like so totally right in being pissed at his dad for not being able to take the yacht out this weekend just becaue he blew his entire investment account going allin on options before amzn earnings announcements like whatever your grandparents took a nation at the brink of destruction after the great depression of the and capitalized on an opportunity like no other first the production of war material creating jobs and providing revenueincome on something which is literally meant to be destroyed shortly after only to be reproduced over and over then spoils of war both physical but also intellectual and cultural both steps dominant parts of globalization now years later youve all forgotten what got you where you arewere youre the wealthy kid who refuses to share and while you might be able to claw on to what you got for some time youre not really moving ahead much either compared to everyone else i mean the same thing is happening in norway too we only started getting wealthy after discovering oil all along our coastline a few decades after were already seeing more and more nationalist politicians gain popularity im certain well be having our own trump running for prime minister in years time and him probably doing quite well too

Showerthoughts,removed,and what part of the truth in my comments make me an idiot refute my statements or at least point out where you disagree but i guess actual debate vs ad hominem attacks is too much to ask not sure where you are from or what makes someone an idiot there but where i come from simply insulting someone for disagreeing makes you the idiot
Showerthoughts,removed,the twitter generation in action characters or less otherwise attention span cant keep up
Showerthoughts,removed,not insulting americans i am saying nationalism is causing american lives to deteriorate something which is clearly evident when looking at statistics facts in my exchange with uiwearsketchers ergo i am not guilty of nationalism again reading comprehension work it mate the same thing is happening in norway too we only started getting wealthy after discovering oil all along our coastline a few decades after were already seeing more and more nationalist politicians gain popularity im certain well be having our own trump running for prime minister in years time and him probably doing quite well too no hypocrisy here
Showerthoughts,removed,yet here you are reading and commenting hm
Showerthoughts,removed,bravo for editing your post way after i replied to it norway was originally bankrolled by oil america was originally bankrolled to a great deal by profiteering off of the worst war this world has ever seen and resource grabbing in countries all over the world through perpetual invasion in the past century great britain was originally bankrolled by invading most of the world and trafficking in slaves stealing local resources where they settled not sure who has the worst past but i feel confident its not us your statement that at least america tries to reduce its dependence on oil implies that norway does not this tells me you are more of an ignorant yokel your words not mine as you obviously have done zero research on how much environmental research innovation and policy progress is being made right here in norway we are innovating and spearheading some of the worlds leading policies when it comes to climate protection which we are trying to make other countries adopt our wealth fund which owns more than of the entire planets equities with a value of over bn per norwegian practices a concept in which they will not invest our money in businesses that do not treasure the same values childrens rights water preservation climate change the private usbased consultancy dual citizen llc reported in that norway was the second most environmentally friendly country in the world only surpassed by our neighbours in sweden neither usa nor britain made it to the top btw this year yale center for environmental law policy ycelp collaborated with a number of other american organizations on their environmental performance index report which ranks countries performance on highpriority environmental issues norway was ranked up from whereas usa was ranked down from last year so whereas your statements may feel good and right to say they arent actually backed up by fact sort of like the politicians you back and the things they say mostly just gibberish that gets the masses riled up i think youll find thats where the real joke lies
Showerthoughts,removed,i am not trashing america and i am not proudly talking up norway however facts are facts norway does a lot more environmental work than america and america was way more advanced compared to other nations in the past than today mostly due to globalism i dont understand why you americans are calling facts for trashtalkinginsultsetc but grow some skin eh

Showerthoughts,removed,these easily offended people are a threat to our free speech your free speech is not threatened because you think some people are easily offended you can say any damn thing you please and legally get away with it thats all free speech means it doesnt mean your exempt from peoples reactions to those words not in the slightest to be completely honest in that video you linked that entire confrontation could have been avoided if the guy had actually answered her damn question instead of repeating hugh mungus like an idiot and walking away he never actually answers her question at all he just keeps repeating hugh mungus as if its supposed to mean something i cant figure out what the hell hes trying to do i had to go to know your meme to even determine that he was supposedly trying to tell some sort of dad joke although it really doesnt sound like one and i still cant tell whats going on maybe instead of asserting that she gets too easily offended someone could actually answer the god damn question hugh mungus what thatd be nice for context
Showerthoughts,removed,there is no reasoning with someone who reaches that level of hysteria who was purposefully intending on being aggressive with him due to his support of policemen from the very start thats the point he didnt reason with her he didnt even try you act like these people arent people you treat them as some kind of wuss who cant think rationally in reality either answering her question it was a joke about my weight or not making the joke at all would have been the best answer even given your logic neither of those are hard to say but he didnt he repeated hugh mungus and wut to everything and he walked away he looked frankly like a complete idiot on camera and people use that and then circlejerk a bunch of memes and go home the only reason youre saying she was out to get him was his word for it and the fact that its on which reddit gets an unconditional boner for and finally none of this even remotely threatens your free speech as was said above so the point is moot regardless of whose side youre on

Showerthoughts,removed,actually if you go back and read my post i never said that researching an alternate candidate was the third choice specifically i never stated what the third choice was in general terms if someone offers me two things i have at least three choices when making a decision after that i said that people should take the time to research alternate candidates that are running for the same position on the ballot i filled out last night there were over a dozen different people listed as running for the president i knew of four of them because i had researched them and picked the candidate that i felt would best lead our country im still not understanding where youre coming up with the laws of the states you dont live in because i never mentioned a single law at all only choices as a netiquette suggestion starting an argument that doesnt make sense and then calling people names doesnt get you anywhere if you want to explain what youre talking about id be more than happy to discuss it if you want to spiral off into no where and continue to try and insult me please forward your resplies to devnull

Showerthoughts,removed,he probably means thief because of the political climate back in the day that led to them raping the planet the economy of other nations and eventually our own doubt thats any of your personal responsibility but the point he makes stands i know people with higher education and two sometimes three jobs that can barely afford to share an apartment a pregnancy or healthcare issue or even a broke down car would wreck them wages are stagnant and gainful employment is decreasing as people are becoming more productive workers and more educated education costs as much as a small or sometimes large house now and the stem path to riches is now just tem or te if even that
Showerthoughts,removed,this is so obvious but ill still get called racist for it former generations had great earning jobs in construction that are now done by immigrants for wages much lower than previous generations would have done them for sorry but it is simple economics that million people affect average wages when they are concentrated in a few types of jobs i knew people whose fathers were roofers growing up black and white american citizens they had very nice middle class lives despite the skin cancer and broken bones they were put out of business by immigrant crews in less than decade its not the immigrants fault for trying to improve their lives but its damn sure our fault for letting it happen

Showerthoughts,removed,i know what you mean ive dug myself into a hole at work where im doing the job of several people now it has been difficult but i am specifically reining myself back im being vocal to my superiors in letting them know that i have a set of actual responsibilities and all of this extra work needs to be delegated elsewhere like the senior workers who are paid much more

Showerthoughts,removed,but what is the problem with complaining why should it be a problem that millenials want to change the burning house weve been given that begins with addressing all the problems that we hoped the generation would work on isnt that what society is supposed to do the best time to build a tree is years ago and the second best time is now no one is unwilling to pay their dues or is unwilling to work hard but in a time when statistically a good job does not give as much money as many benefits as someone identical in experience as yourself who took it years ago you want to be paid what youre worth who says you have to be lowballed but give top quality work

Showerthoughts,removed,part of the reason health care costs less in socialized countries is because they give year old pain meds instead of health care

Showerthoughts,removed,i keep running this back and forth in my mind it sounds good on the one hand but i think ultimately itd be of no benefit to them netflix makes money off of advertising and subscribers when they create original content and its a hit they also make more money from advertising and product placement my gut tells me they stand to make a lot more money from advertising than spotify could ever dream of spotifys main source of revenue is its subscribers they also make money off of advertising through their free tier but i highly doubt anyone on the free tier would listen just for their home grown artists and they also dont have full control over what they listen to to me the smarter business strategy for spotify is to get as many established acts on board as they can their game plan has to be to increase subscribers netflix is different in that they dont necessarily need to increase subscribers to make more money off of them id say its an idea that sounds good on the surface but because the economics of companies is so different i dont think it would work out the same

Showerthoughts,removed,riamverysmart
Showerthoughts,removed,seems a lil strange to me seeing as it wasnt funny either way

Showerthoughts,removed,okay donald
Showerthoughts,removed,there should at least be one publicly funded news station
Showerthoughts,removed,its also unfortunate that people think they can rely on any single news source for their information getting informed about the world is hard work and it is everyones civic responsibility it is your job to sift through multiple sources cut through biases your own and the medias and try to figure out what is really going on if you think you can get your news by sitting on your couch for an hour of infotainment you are doing democracy wrong

Showerthoughts,removed,both are forms of jews trying to indoctrinate the masses so it doesnt matter
Showerthoughts,removed,it isnt necessarily that factchecking and news are two separate things now all good news is still factchecked although admittedly there is a rise is fake news out there by nonmainstream outlets nbsp however in recent months years the emphasis on factchecking is about checking the validity of statements made by the individuals the news is reporting on the real problem is with the thruthiness of things that public figures feel like they can get away with saying in this postfacts society we are moving towards nbsp when says some crazy stuff a news agency can either just state so and so said some crazy stuff at their rally in everytown usa today or they could also factcheck that statement for you and tell you whether or not it is true nbsp traditionally we have had some degree of trust in public figures and the news has been able to present most statements at face value therefore i wouldnt really argue that the news is doing a worse job at factchecking its that they are now being asked to fact check not only themselves but anyone they report on as well

Showerthoughts,removed,theyre encouraging each other to put even more effort into working for the ruling class man this is really really a thing people are so indoctrinated into being a good employee i went through this recently went to work regionally in the snow a top tier resort and great snowboarding but the kind of place where every employer charges you up to half your wage for a bed in a room with others in bunks and shared bathroom facilities also always freezing and the provided food simply wasnt there half the time to top it off the boss was an angry ex alcoholic narcissistic micro managing asshat literally everyone hated him hed made at least of the server girls break down in tears at various stages he had one return staff member from the previous seasons and even they refused to work on more than a part time basis for the guy after weeks of shit when i decided to up and leave every other crew member in the place whod constantly complain about every aspect of the workplace and conditions decided that me not seeing the season out another weeks was doing the wrong thing by the company who gave you the chance to be here the amount of pressure they put on me to stay was unbelievable some dont talk to me anymore ive been back home making money and hanging with my girlfriend i dont regret a goddamn thing
Showerthoughts,removed,please clarify i agree with much of what was said by this banksy i am not interested in the incredibly flimsy appeal to authority banksy is a moron and you can dismiss the entire argument presented because as a woman that is not banksy i am better made by the poster below i understand the argument made against advertisements and the proconsumer message offered by this banksy character for the average person it is all but impossible to remove negative messages that advertisements present the verbal diarrhea is so prevalent and exhaustive that i find myself not so upset that someone defaced an exxon mobil posterboard to portray the companys effect on the environment merely writing an insult does not invalidate banksys argument it enhances it
Showerthoughts,removed,the analogy is no good though we also pay for television services and dont get paid for seeing the ads displayed on it however it is a good argument against data caps and for adblockers we certainly shouldnt be paying extra to accomodate ads and we shouldnt be blocked from sites for not looking at ads thats a little like being told you pay for a certain number of minutes of television and cant choose what the minutes are spent on or like being told that leaving the room during the ads causes you to be unable to watch a particular programme
Showerthoughts,removed,no you dont you pay for access to the content just like when you pay for cable but with cable you cant be blocked from a tv show for leaving the room during the ads nor do the ads use some of your tv allowance
Showerthoughts,removed,the problem is not that the idea of ip exists i own copyrighted work as well but i am the creator of that work corporations buy and sell ideas and they never die there is no end to their ownership honestly no one should be able to copyright or patent anything for a period of more than years full stop no renewals no passing it along to someone else or any of the nonsense that goes on right now if you cant make the value of and a profit from your idea in years then it should be free for others to have a go at music movies books art inventions designs technology years and its public property its simple no need to change a whole load of things just make it reasonable
Showerthoughts,removed,drug patents mmm yes the drug patents are evil thing go ahead and get your first drug on the market hope youve got a lot of money to cover the years youre going to dedicate to making this years that dont even guarantee it will make it to the market in the first place oh and after the billion youve spent and the decade of work youve put into making this drug were going to let your friends down the street make your drug as welland a couple other guys you dont know good luck making your money back yeah im sure companies will be lined up to make new drugs with that kind of attitude

Showerthoughts,removed,youre talking to an environmental scientistgreen engineer youre not going to change my stance in the slightest the creation myth is fucking ridiculous we have so much proof of evolution that its virtually indisputable i believe in science the periodic table is the closest thing to a bible ill ever need the scientific community has made so many discoveries in the past years that it is mindblowing we can explain the foundations of physics and we can observe distant galaxies with the laws of physics and laws of chemistry science in general we are actually beginning to understand how our universe works how it began and what goes on inside it just because you choose to put your beliefs in a ridiculous book doesnt make you any more right we know how life works were just a series of chemical reactions then we die thats life youre a chemical reaction no more no less i dont see the need to sugarcoat it everytime a new discovery is made the religious always do one of two things accept it for fact and attribute the findings to the work of god or flat out deny it and all the supporting evidence that was compiled about the discovery there is no god and theres no point in me entertaining your choosing ignorance over fact if humans died today and millions of years later a new intelligent species evolved on earth the religions they conjur up would be vastly different than the ones humans created the science however would be identical im not judging you for choosing to ignore the facts a hell of a lot of people do but the answers to most of your questions have probably been answered go to google scholar and search for something we probably figured out how it works already and you can learn it wanna know what is a fact god had nothing to do with it the universe is utterly fucking fascinating and its a damn shame that so many choose to live in ignorance than take the time to learn how awesome everything really is

Showerthoughts,removed,romeo and juliet essay romeo and juliet is a play written by william shakespeare which is set in verona italy in since then there have been many adapted plays and movies like the famous baz luhrmann movie in this essay will show how shakespeare entertains his audience through his use of character language and drama romeo has to face the fact that he has married a capulet and tybalt is hunting romeo down to fight because romeo snuck into the party the purpose of the humour at the beginning of the scene is to entertain the audience when he enters the tavern and says god send me no need of thee and by the operation of the second cup draws him on his drawer when indeed there is no need it can be argued that mercutio is making fun of tybalt by saying he is fake manly like getting drunk and going into a fight mercutio is there to put some humour into to the scene too so it does not get too gloomy tybalt wants revenge on romeo because he showed up at the capulets party tybalt wanted to throw romeo out but lord capulet stopped him and let him stay then lady capulet got angry at lord capulet for yelling at tybalt so he wants to earn his honour back by killing romeo boy this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw romeo does not want to fight tybalt because he is tybalts kingsman because he married juliet tybalt does not know that so he wants to fight romeo becomes enraged when mercutio dies and wants revenge on tybalt they fight and romeo kills tybalt romeo becomes very sad and when he becomes very sad his anger comes out so he kills tybalt when benvolio tells romeo that mercutio is dead romeo says this days black fate on more days doth depend this but begins the woe others must end this means that romeo fears that the evil outcomes of the violence of mercutios death lies in the future this foreshadows the end of the play when romeo and juliet die when tybalt wants to fight romeo who declined mercutio fights in romeos place romeo tries to stop him by pushing away tybalt comes in and stabs mercutio under romeos arm when mercutio finally realizes he is dying he says ask for me tomorrow and you should find me a grave man the word grave creates the pun it could mean that romeo will find him to be a serious man tomorrow or that he will find that he is dead and in a grave tomorrow the scene ends with the nurse telling juliet that romeo is banished from verona and that he will never come back if he does he will have to sneak back undercover the nurse tries to persuade juliet to go and marry paris and that he is a lovely gentleman or romeo if he is as good as paris romeo does not live in verona anymore and juliet will not get to enjoy him when the nurse leaves juliet talks about the nurse behind her back because she does not agree with what she said juliet and the nurse have a good relationship because the nurse acts as her mother from when she was a baby the nurse acts in a motherly way with juliet in act scene juliet tries to convince romeo that the birdcalls they hear are from the nightingale a night bird rather than from the lark a morning bird romeo has to leave before morning comes or be put to death juliet says the light is from a meteor rather than the sun this explains that juliet wants romeo to stay but romeo says he needs to be gone before dawn or he is dead juliet does not treat her mother as a mother she was never there for her it was always the nurse since she was a baby she treats the nurse more like a mother than her actual mother dramatic irony is shown when lady capulet comes into juliets room finding her crying at the balcony lady capulet thinks juliet is still crying about tybalts death when in reality she is crying about romeo leaving this is dramatic irony because lady capulet thinks juliet is crying about tybalt instead of something else the audience know who juliet is crying about but a character in the play does not an example of romeos use of metaphors is in this quote which compares night and day to happiness and sorrow some say the lark makes sweet division this doth not so for she divideth us this means that the lark does not make a couple come together but divides them juliet symbolises light because she can be out in the day in verona but romeo cannot because he can die romeo is the dark so the dark foreshadows their death because romeo goes to see juliet at the wrong time when she is faking death so he goes to buy poison to suicide right beside her juliet wakes up at the same time as when romeo suicides so she takes the sword off of romeo and kills herself too basically romeo is the one to blame the death of both of them this essay looked at how action character and language was shown in two scenes in the play romeo and juliet to entertain an audience now we know that tybalt wanted to kill romeo because he made tybalt look bad in front of everyone and to get his honour back he wanted to kill romeo i did not like the play as i am not a fan of plays and the genre of romance the message of the play is that if you love someone very much you do not mind killing yourself when they are dead to be with them for the rest of eternity

Showerthoughts,removed,this is definitely not true yes many film actors do find success in theatre after their career wanes but it is also a very common thing for actors to participate on and off throughout their careers just look at the number of celebrities who do stints on broadway and regional theatres not to mention careers like lin manuelmiranda that continue to sky rocket because of his success in the theatre

Showerthoughts,removed,at our european airline we can have qualified medical personnel open the kit without authorization from the company
Showerthoughts,removed,i think this is more related to laws about flight worthiness when this kit is used theres a fair chance the plane is no longer airworthy on its next run so the company has to provide a replacement on the next airport
Showerthoughts,removed,you know what to do this is a great example of the opposite end of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikidunning–krugereffect you doubt yourself because you know the complexity but reality is youd be much more useful than others on the plane due to your knowledge
Showerthoughts,removed,im a surgeon your average proctologist just to use your example of a specialized doctor who does not deal with cardiac emergencies would be maybe marginally more helpful than an ordinary citizen in such a situation the medical school training for such situations is basic at best and would almost certainly be buried so deep as to be inaccessible in an emergency situation contrary to popular belief we do not come out of medical school as fully fledged adult doctors ready to solve all problems we come out like a larva with a lot of book knowledge but almost no experiential knowledge our residency training is where we learn most of our useful skills and everyone knows you need to practice skills for them to work especially in a stressful time if however that proctologist kept up on his emergency training and was ready for the circumstance so that he could be a certified md on board for flights then sure theyd be helpful that could be a thing

Showerthoughts,removed,fun safety tips to teach your kids if theyre lost or need help the kid should find an adult woman and go ask her for help if some adult they dont know starts offering help before the kid asks say no and walk away we all know stranger danger is actually very rare but you can make it exponentially rarer if your kid follows those two guidelines the kid chooses which adult to approach for help and the kid picks a woman telling them to find a cop is all well and good but usually when a kid gets scared and is alone theres not a cop in eyesight

Showerthoughts,removed,well i pay for google music and it happens to come with youtube red i dont know that i would pay for youtube red as stand alone service as the incentive for no ads and original content available doesnt really appeal to me also i would argue that content has gotten better as content creators have been able to monetize their videos and turn youtube videos into a viable career option sure there was this sense of democratization of content back in the day and it was only a platform for sharing but its not a sustainable business model the amount of resources to run a website of that size isnt cheap you seem to have plenty of criticisms but no actual solution how would you pay for the servers you mentioned yourself how the platform is still not profitable how do you convince investors to continue to invest into the platform without some semblance of a profitable future
Showerthoughts,removed,it doesnt you have to select a thumbnail from a list generated by youtube directly from the video the trick is that people know what times the frames selected as options are and add just frame at that spot containing the image they want to use as a thumbnail not a lot that can be done about that

Showerthoughts,removed,its always been weird this way if you become a heroin addict and spend years shitting in your pants then get out of it everyone admires you if you are an average joe who spent his life making a living supporting his family but never doing anything wild you are a boring loser and nobody gives two fucks about what you accomplished so i guess the lesson here is if you wanna be popular and admired do drugs the little periods when you start telling your peers you are clean will make you a rockstar
Showerthoughts,removed,yep ive even been told by other friends that sometimes no one wants to go out so we have to predrink to get in the mood to go out living the life i see
Showerthoughts,removed,choosing to not try it because a family member is an alcoholic doesnt make sense to me im not going to go into detail with my friends about how i already am aware of my addictive tendencies i havent ever had a drink and if its as good as it sounds then id be fucked
Showerthoughts,removed,that was part of my reason too one year were all playing airsoft after school in the woods and the next everyone just wants to get drunk
Showerthoughts,removed,or maybe you are just a muslim alhumdulillah
Showerthoughts,removed,then the maker of that detector is a liar he says that it detects lies but it sometimes cannot and says i dont know maker is a liar just like a god
Showerthoughts,removed,im with you there as someone with plenty of family who have abused substances and some who even supported their addictions its just not worth the risk i get weird looks by some peers but i value my health far more than their opinions of me
Showerthoughts,removed,you dont drink it because of your addictive tendencies yet you quoted my comment about having a family member that is addicted for being a reason to not drink one of the key things about alcoholism being genetic is because traits about how you handle stress are genetic my family members are alcoholic and use it to self medicate when stressed i am already seeing similar signs in myself with other activities so i opted to avoid alcohol
Showerthoughts,removed,nope because im not from a trash family
Showerthoughts,removed,except it isnt alcohol is a depressant that affects the brain in such a way that it creates the desire to drink more the drink itself is addictive people can recover from it of course people can also recover from heroine marijuana and smoking addictions they are not purely mental
Showerthoughts,removed,also in the event that you do trust their blinker and they dont turn and hit you their turn signal doesnt make them wrong legally or in the eyes of insurance companies
Showerthoughts,removed,alcohol does not work for everyone it never did a thing for me and after college i eliminated it from my life im going on years without it now and i would never go back and no ive never had a problem drinking nor are there any alcoholics in my family or any religious people in my life who dont drink ive even worked in a bar and got to see up close what it does to people and it holds no interest for me at all im happy without it and i dont need alcohol to do anything or to enhance my life in any way
Showerthoughts,removed,moral high ground would be drinking to have fun is alcohol abuse and im above that im simply saying i have no interest in getting wasted but they assume the above when i mention i dont drink
Showerthoughts,removed,i see where youre coming from i think its just easier for the majority to drink than to make an effort to do something new and be bothered to convince their friends too
Showerthoughts,removed,you dont know anyone that needs to go out on friday nights
Showerthoughts,removed,yes i completely see why people do it im mainly talking about people who have it as part of their routine on weekends
Showerthoughts,removed,why the fuck do we care
Showerthoughts,removed,there is a big difference between a bunch of drunk year olds and a bunch of drunk year olds the former are usually drinking just to be drunk because that in itself is the fun with age its use changes somewhat
Showerthoughts,removed,please dont kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,you are one retarded person then
Showerthoughts,removed,i just dont understand why you are commenting on a thread specifically about alcoholic beverages if you dont care about what anyone thinks about beverages or food
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah but we knew it was a kentucky fried hayden christiansen under that mask and all the former vader badassary evaporated
Showerthoughts,removed,are you trying to break the matrix because this is how you break the matrix
Showerthoughts,removed,my brother in law tore his acl when he was young got surgery he fucking loved morphine after he finished those pills he decided he was not ever going to try any intoxicant unless prescribed and never ask for one either he was in his late teens the most alcohol hes had has been in the occasional wine sauce hes never tried pot or any illegal drugs but whenever he gets hurt he gets kind of excited because maybe hell get more opiates before i understood i used to tease him about his teetotaling i have tremendous respect for him and anyone who chooses not to try intoxicants of any sort
Showerthoughts,removed,very niche complaint here he talked about the philosophy of the dragon shouts but they were just general ideas that retroactively are analyzed with fuck it
Showerthoughts,removed,my experience has been the reverse
Showerthoughts,removed,i disagree i dont think the general principle works harrison bergeroning aside can you name a modern third wave feminist whose positions are respected by a sizable portion of people irl and who is part of the larger feminist movement whose position is make their life as bad as ours
Showerthoughts,removed,no because he is the four chinned man nbsp okay lets calm down
Showerthoughts,removed,tr
Showerthoughts,removed,yup that sounds about right rule dont b a bitch no one likes a quitter this was the way i lived the last years but now i tell myself im not quitting im taking a calculated break in the last months i havent drank ive been able to save im not joking i was the guy getting everyone drunk and fucked up if everyone else was wasted and blacked out then i wasnt a drunk bc everyone else around me was having a good one also i just work i dont call off work or eat out that often ive change my eating habits and gym habits i still go to bar on occasion but i dont drink its not hard when im at the bar its hard when im by myself
Showerthoughts,removed,stpuid bitch
Showerthoughts,removed,again alcohol isnt providing any substance that is being required by the body according to your link in the absence of alcohol the brain is releasing certain damaging chemicals with increasing severity depending on the amount and frequency of consumption before stopping im not saying you can should or that its even ok to just stop cold turkey only that there is no substance in alcohol that becomes required by your body
Showerthoughts,removed,unfortunately a lot of people are ignorant about drug effects and dangerous combos i wished there could be health classes installed in the educational system i am sure there would be a lot of benefits

Showerthoughts,removed,well yea i dont dissagre with you but it really is a very simplified way of seeing the problem please read this article you can probably refute a lot of things in it but for me it hit close to home about my own problems sorry btw if i sounded rude im really hungover

Showerthoughts,removed,my phone always tries to autosuggest obama after i type president its more terrified of president trump than i am
Showerthoughts,removed,you are dead wrong instead of just taking my phone and laptop my mom would take my all of books tv cord and sketchpad and colored pencils too so basically all i could do was studydo homework shower eat dinner and then go to bed it was incredibly boring and it only happened to me one time it was all because i stretched my earlobes for weeks because at the time i thought i was emo back when that was a thing i was just dumb a kid after my mom told me not to because she thought it was gross and ugly so then my brother found out and told her because hes a snitch so i got one week for disobeying and one week for every week i hid it and lied about it so i was grounded for an entire month and almost couldnt go to my senior prom my mom was super pissed at me the silver lining in being grounded was that i ended up on the honor roll and graduated high school with a gpa best ive ever done in school lol i ended up stretching my ears again after i graduated and moved out and we laughed about it because she couldnt ground me anymore but she still hated it i ended up taking them out after i got married and started going to church it just isnt who i am anymore now im a little too country and i love jesus not that emo people cant love him too i went the exact opposite of emo sorry this story ended up being a lot longer than anticipated lol

Showerthoughts,removed,time flies when you have crippling debt
Showerthoughts,removed,kinda looking forward to gonna feel like a nap
Showerthoughts,removed,another thing to consider is that years have titles attached to them grade sophomore year etc so when you look back at that age you think of an entire year of school everything that happened within that year when i look back at years old i cant think of it the same way
Showerthoughts,removed,humans have watched kirk battle khan too many times and are living in a delusion
Showerthoughts,removed,im sure theres some study that says otherwise but based on my own observations of life and people notwithstanding exceptions a man is really in his intellectualpersonal prime in his late early if youre a professional athlete then your bodily prime might be your but the wisdom you pick up in your not to mention the general leveling out process that takes place as far as decisionmaking it comes as no surprise whatsoever that the moon men were in their late and beyond
Showerthoughts,removed,probably because you only communicate with him when either you want to share something or you need him to do something but never to ask whats going on in his day
Showerthoughts,removed,i couldve sworn they were like months or some shit i think the reason time went by so slowly back then is that there wasnt much of a care in the world we lived only for the next minute of our life as to what we did to enjoy things now we work and live only for the next paycheck my mind tends to zone out doing stuff i dont like and it makes me enjoy stuff i like a whole lot less if i sit down and play a video game i might play it for minutes and get bored because my minds processing that i could be doing something useful or making money if i find that rare video game that i play for hours my mind still does those checks but at the end of the play session i feel like ive been playing it for hours and it reminds me of my childhood that is probably why i have such a high regard of games like the last of us and uncharted and they captured that feeling of spending ages playing a game but enjoying it the entire time but yeah i think that combined with us simply having to actually track more information kids bills relationships work etc makes time seem like its going by faster
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah they spent billion dollars fixing all that code and now people think it was all bullshit and the people that took action to prepare are tinfoilhat weirdos it was not bullshit i knew two programmers who were working sixteen hour days seven days a week rewriting code in november of they quit their jobs and bought land and moved their families to rural montana to get out of the city a wide circle of my friends stockpiled the necessities of survival my wife and i stockpiled eight months worth of food people make snide remarks about but if the repair effort had been unsuccessful we would have had airliners falling out of the sky and trains roaring through disabled switches they grounded the airliners at midnight until it was clear that the patches worked
Showerthoughts,removed,i still think of the as years ago
Showerthoughts,removed,dont take this the wrong way but how would that change your life i wouldnt call it pocket money but i dont concider it a life changing amount i am genuinly wondering not trying to be a dick it doesnt even cover a semester of college and if you use it to pay off a loan like some people here said that loan is not a big enough burden to be life changing is it
Showerthoughts,removed,thats all you can saaay
Showerthoughts,removed,but the two are unrelated apparently you do not understand analogies so lets try this a driver should be able to recognize a flat tire and not drive on it a driver should know when a car needs maintenance it is ok for a driver to pay people to carry out the maintenance because that is completely unrelated to the act of driving there is nothing entitled about it taxpayer dollars are not subsidizing aaa people use their own money to pay it i know how to change a tire and check oil i make money from my job if i get a flat in the rain you better believe i am paying someone to change that shit for me making decisions on how to spend my own fucking money is the opposite of entitled
Showerthoughts,removed,you are right im supporting them from a distance

Showerthoughts,removed,cybernetic organism
Showerthoughts,removed,this filipino guy works with me hes my age but i swear he looks younger then hes never shaved yet he says he had a year old girl try to hit on him at the gym always when hes buying booze they examine his id like its a forgery
Showerthoughts,removed,exactly like in the same way if you sit on your couch all day and watch tv the day flies by quickly but if youre out and about running errands and doing different things when you finally make it back home the day felt much longer
Showerthoughts,removed,because youre shitty and dont know how to have fun
Showerthoughts,removed,once you own your car you can switch to liability insurance instead of full coverage now not only do you have a car payment every month but your car insurance just got cut in half too if you take that extra money and throw it in a side savings account each month it adds up to thousands extra each year this can easily parlay into buying your next used car with cash and not paying penny of interest and starting day with liability insurance
Showerthoughts,removed,id like to point out that the reason for this accelerated plundering of the earths resources is due to the dominant socioeconomic system capitalism
Showerthoughts,removed,you are now the special adviser to the president on cyber warfare
Showerthoughts,removed,you must be american
Showerthoughts,removed,youre preaching to the choir in my world the car you can afford is the car you can buy with cash today in i bought a used honda accord with miles for cash years later its still going strong and i have a side fund to replace it when it goes along with a emergency fund to cover a year of expenses if anything catastrophic happens its nice having none of our paychecks going out to loans other than our quite reasonable mortgage payment
Showerthoughts,removed,no sane person is looking at mars optimistically elon musk
Showerthoughts,removed,yes well until you have a means of editing human genetics in real time and not generationally and until you have a proven biological scheme to survive any and all potential circumstances that starfaring humans will face from world to world you wont even have a premise based in science fiction this is pure fantasy every time the human being steps foot outside of normal environmental circumstances disease rear their head look at all the weird shit that happens to the iss people who stay there too long how can we possibly adapt our skeletal system to different gravity thats been one of my favorite holes in the terraforming proposition everyone is bothered by the hows and wheres of transforming the atmosphere and no one talks gravity and magnetic shielding it turns out dna really doesnt like interstellar radiation
Showerthoughts,removed,its not what you said its how you said it
Showerthoughts,removed,start we need to start the magnetosphere and any technologically advanced species that can literally kick start a planets core probably doesnt need terraforming to begin with
Showerthoughts,removed,would be cray life changing for me no doubt that or reddit gold reddit gold would be decently life altering for sure
Showerthoughts,removed,yup this is why we dont have a mars base yet when weve had the ability to do so for decades
Showerthoughts,removed,water can be synthesized and planets terraformed we cant do that yet in a sustainable fashion but who says future generations wont
Showerthoughts,removed,i doubt that you just remembered it
Showerthoughts,removed,i just saw one of the last episodes of the first seasonthank god there were no spoilers on here
Showerthoughts,removed,blue blood is a myth spread by idiots im sorry that you had shit fuck education
Showerthoughts,removed,im confused your original post seemed to suggest that you were against free speech being used to fight to end free speech but youre totes okay with the things i complained about above
Showerthoughts,removed,are we actually going there for resources were not its just a trope used by lazy scriptwriters weve contaminated the earth so badly we have to move to another planet right exactly how do you screw up the earth so badly that mars starts to look attractive its never going to happen even if we put all of our resources into building cobalt bombs to irradiate the entire surface of the planet it would be far cheaper and more cost effective to live in underground cities on earth than to establish even the smallest selfsustaining colony on another world imagine the effort required to get a single bulldozer to mars and operate it for decades theres no oxygen for an airbreathing diesel engine and presumably no source of fossil fuels you need big solar arrays or nuclear power to generate electricity to run the vehicle or to process other chemicals into fuels and then you need the infrastructure to maintain the vehicle spare parts a machine shop lubricants hydraulic fluid on earth when things start going bad youve already got an immense global industrial capability and huge stockpiles of materials that can be salvaged even if new production stops you have giant earth movers and tunnel boring machines a plenty of manual labor why the hell does interstellar end with everyone living in an oneill cylinder colony in the outer solar system if they could build a completely sealed ecosystem in a space ship they could do the same thing but with the ship sitting in a parking lot or in an old salt mine theyd even still have ground water geothermal heat and the ability to roam around the surface with nothing more than oxygen masks and very thorough decontamination and quarantine on reentry to the sealed environment space colonization will never be about population pressure and for mineral resources off world were better off looking at asteroids and things not deep in a gravity well
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,no youd still have to achieve escape velocity to stop being in marss orbit and then even more to transfer to earth orbit as opposed to simply flying around the sun in a very different orbit forever that requires a huge amount of energy its multiple times less than bringing stuff up from earth see see but still enormous its convenient to assume that theyre stacked in a spaceport orbiting mars anything we get from mars is not in its orbit and getting it up requires a few times more energy than getting it from mars to earth and the even bigger problem is that if you want to make a business shipping something from mars you dont have free ships in orbit there you have to bring a ship from earth you have to bring fuel from earth and you have to bring the ship or its materials and fuel up from earth to space and before you suggest making the fuel onsite well the infrastructure to do that is heavier than just bringing the fuel from home for many many times making that infrastructure is possible but its not worth doing that for a measly few pallets of platinum in comparison to that stripmining the whole of antarctica would be technically much simpler faster and cheaper
Showerthoughts,removed,imagine having jewelry made of mars gold

Showerthoughts,removed,i like to think you say go fuck yourself because youre implying the person youre talking to is an unlovable cunt take that literally or figuratively the only way that cunt will ever be pleasured is if they do all their own fucking instead of waiting for someone to love them to be absolutely transparent as nicely as that explanation or any in the thread make sense people are basic when theyre angry and swearing is often simple rather than a multilevel anger code i reckon this phrase just came about because its a way of telling someone to stop being obnoxious that works the word fuck in to the sentence too
Showerthoughts,removed,simpsons did it

Showerthoughts,removed,op youre a cuck
Showerthoughts,removed,this just isnt true heck the leading cause of death in the us would be virtually wiped out if we stopped eating meat
Showerthoughts,removed,live stock doesnt need to be abused for our consumption vote with your dollar vote against abusive environments and buy grass fed so that these animals can live as they were ment to before slaughter plus an animal that eats its natural food sources produces much healthier meat cows and other farm animals arent ment to eat corn and live out their lives standing in feces being sick
Showerthoughts,removed,i wouldnt eat a dog even if i was starving to death

Showerthoughts,removed,because a vegan diet results in vitamin deficiencies notably we are omnivores we do best with a varied diet per calorie meat has a lower environmental impact then vegetables however we do have way too much meat and our portions are large so downsizing portions is a good idea i used to be a beef butcher and have worked on a large scale chicken farm in the past i personally havent abused animals bruised meat and stressed animals dont taste as good
Showerthoughts,removed,ha cattle is more like and chickens are fish are like but thats only because of vertical feeding systems
Showerthoughts,removed,that girl will go into your place and suck to you
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah with all the antibiotic resistance you can acquire from eating meat amirite
Showerthoughts,removed,procrastination wait a minute is it a good idea to be bad or good at being good or bad at procrastinating when good ideas turn out to be bad
Showerthoughts,removed,this post is so dumb im thinking poking a fork in a electrical socket isnt a bad idea
Showerthoughts,removed,lmao it is very easy nowadays to do a simple google search and find all the info you need i highly doubt most people would be willing to completely change their diet but refuse to give the smallest effort to look into it
Showerthoughts,removed,when the person you are arguing is a brainless veggie you just insult
Showerthoughts,removed,editing footage specifically to manipulate the emotions of viewers gosh the creators of films like this must hate that sort of thing

Showerthoughts,removed,weve spent over thousand years breeding cows to turn them from dangerous wild beasts into a giant block of meat on stilts i think design is a perfectly appropriate word here

Showerthoughts,removed,nobody remembers seinfeld just let it die
Showerthoughts,removed,well technically no animals need to eat meat they do so because its a good source of nutrition and calories and its readily available should we start feeding soylent to lions so they dont need to hunt gazelle anymore if you think its unethical to force your ideology on animals why do you think its okay to do it to humans
Showerthoughts,removed,i see your point but just thinking about each term does enslaving count if you arent forcing them to work say for beef cattle that basically just have their movement restricted and are protected from predators given vaccineswormers and treated for disease i can see the point for a dairy cow or layer hens torture i dont really see no one is tying their animals down and whipping them granted some people treat them awfully and should be prosecuted murder yeah sure cant argue with that one
Showerthoughts,removed,learn to respect the food you eat dont be one of those people who eats half a burger and throws the rest in the garbage remember that someone suffered and gave their life to nourish you and be thankful for it
Showerthoughts,removed,the protein that matters only comes from animal sources its why the vitamin is supplemented in all nonmeat eaters diets therefore an animal must die in order for all people to get access to vitamin
Showerthoughts,removed,my boss your wife saw at this point pussy
Showerthoughts,removed,the fuck is wrong with you
Showerthoughts,removed,kind of however your body makes it pretty much physically impossible to kill yourself by holding your breath without being underwater because either the impulse to breath becomes uncontrollable and your body just forces you to take a breath without conscious thought you or faint and automatically start breathing again
Showerthoughts,removed,there is no accident when a deity is the one you leave your family planning to
Showerthoughts,removed,if you look through your family history and there is a gap over two years between kids thats likely an indicator of fertility problems of some sort its not all or nothing its not instant kid or complete infertility it can take time there are miscarriages etc its probably more rare to pop out a kid whenever you want especially since you have to consider the mothers issues fathers issues and issues with how they work together
Showerthoughts,removed,if calling yourself veggie isnt enough of an insult for you i dont know what is
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah i think youre right
Showerthoughts,removed,because i hate making mistakes being fluent in english is one of my skills it was one of my praised abilities both when i was studying in uni in my country and in finland plus there are words i know and use in verbal language that i have no idea how to write hence i dont want to come off as an idiot who uses bigboy words without knowing how to write them
Showerthoughts,removed,chicken and fish are sentient chickens have compex social orders and have friendships and exhibit bomding behaviors i know people who have chickens wjo have now accepted them as pets they love watching the chickens in the yards scratching and playing around they are pretty funny and they know when to come to the back door for food and also enjoy being petted and scritched i just watched a video where a fish was caught in a net it had a little vuddy just waiting with it a human rescued it and cut it loose and they swam off together it was very very cute when i scuba dive said me fish interact with me im sure its due to other people feeding in the past but they swim up to my mask and swim around my fingers my interactions with animals has made it impossible for me to eat them
Showerthoughts,removed,that lady wants give her pussy to young
Showerthoughts,removed,lets debunk your logic an actor has free will this dog is being force into the water how many times have you heard of new and aspiring actorsactress beefing manipulated to do things endnotes though they have this supposed free will casting couches injures regret you dont think that there are situations that the director is basically forcing a actor into the water who had the same exact expressions and reactions that you see here free will exist but when you are afraid of your meal ticket only chance and the likely hood of your ass getting canned and they hiring some other poor schlub in a moment notice its not much of a free choice pretty sure most parents didnt throw their kid into a fucking wave pool but there are fucking parents who do that and are proud to do so my father was that guy and i have seen plenty of people proudly state that it was done to them and how theyll do it or had done it to their kids in the future but fuck it just because most people dont do it lets just go back to fucking ignoring it is important although you might not understand that personal attacks huh guess your debunking isnt working out like you confidentially made it out to be huh animal that has not needed a bath for eons suddenly and culturally is made to do so at its expense so that the world wide web can have a laugh nah its kewl and if anyone complains well insinuate that they dont bathe yup yes because nobody cares about animal abuse totally not like there are multiple large organizations to combat this you got me there to a degree but honesty off the top of your head can you name of an organization outside of peta or did you have to web search that answer the dog made none of that money but that money sure as hell shows that dog to live better than a majority of the population on earth i wouldnt be surprised if it lived better than me or a majority of reddit
Showerthoughts,removed,its a way of life for us humans to eat other animals we are born omnivores meat is an another important food source to stay alive and healthy although we have alternate food sources we have already gotten used to it cows pigs and chickens are considered farm animals thus it is normal to raise them kill them slaughter them etc because in the end it will just be eaten dogs and cats are pets or companions that can be attached emotionally to humans so our mindset is to give these animals the same rights and attention as humans do if youre going to stop eating meat just because of this sole reason youre cause is admirable but pointless the whole population cant stop eating meat because its a way of life and removing a way of life is really hard unless forced
Showerthoughts,removed,ok thats a legitimate gripe farmers dont want random strangers going through filming their property the states should enact a law require an oversight committee to film their inspections
Showerthoughts,removed,you should look into suicide so you dont contribute to the over population problem you were whining about earlier

Showerthoughts,removed,and for others it feels like scar has lived a long life as king and now decides he must pass on so scar says lets have scar be the new king and what does simba do will he reclaim the throne shall it be victorious simba clears his throat and says well i say scar should be king the circle of life laughs at simba for being so stupid because everybody knows scar is off his rocker but here we are im hoping scar will be enough of a puppet that simba can prod him along in the right direction

Showerthoughts,removed,incentives unfortunately incentives are a very complex matter and never work without serious balancing
Showerthoughts,removed,although the rich wouldnt admit it i think the people in power for the most part want it to be that way rich people genuinely think they are better at life most of the time
Showerthoughts,removed,doesnt matter the quote is still true learning for a test is still learning worthless shit that doesnt help you in life even when it wasnt so test based school still taught shit that didnt help you in life
Showerthoughts,removed,fuck that im in high school and i love learning i dont just cram for tests and shit the information out afterwards i try to learn it i always pay attention in my classes without question i have very little schoolrelated stress all of my classes but are complete cakewalks and i always try my best that being said not everyone is very enthusiastic about learning my mom is a teacher and shes pissed off at how she has to give all these shitty stateregulated assessments and be observed so frequently and produce all these results that in the end she has no control over she likes devos view on getting the federal government out of schools because frankly this regulation and common core stuff is pure nongmo bullshit she isnt so much for the school choice that devos is proposing because that isnt necessarily a major problem she teaches in a pretty ghetto school not even a fucked up place like chicago completely upperclass compared to that and the kids are just beyond help they cannot understand that they should try in school to do well they have absolutely no sense of what they should be doing to promote a good future for themselves and then they go jack off on social media about school being too hard kids who dont try and soak up tax dollars are a massive problem but i dont really have a solution for it
Showerthoughts,removed,ptsd no
Showerthoughts,removed,teachers do the teaching students do the learning sometimes students need to do more work to learn something than normal the system could obviously be better if class sizes were smaller and teachers and students had access to the resources they needed i think poverty plays a much bigger role in the success of a student than standardized testing does
Showerthoughts,removed,it might depend on learning style ive found ondemand lookups or the occasional video more valuable than the time ive spent in a course half of the reason is content i find on stackexchange is clear and concise and the other half is because i seem to be able to remember things better when im not information overloaded
Showerthoughts,removed,in science your classes should be so interrelated that youre forced to remember things if you ever want to advance the complaint also has to do with the american education system they tend to have a more pump and dump approach to learning
Showerthoughts,removed,thats the same thing you millennial fuck heads
Showerthoughts,removed,well if you cant pass the test do you know the material and if you dont know the material did you really learn i may be a minority here but how else can we track whether a student learned or not by believing i also hear people shitting on standardized testing whats the alternative doing college admissions based on a kids grades as someone who went to a magnet school we were going way faster with our material than most other schools i get a in my honors math class but some kid in an easier school gets a because well its easier and his teacher knows his mom and likes him a little more but if we were to test on standard material i would know more than him therefore id fare better on the test if that gets taken away how is that fair standardized testing is fair you either know it or you dont but eul i bet youre privileged and had more opportunities so you have no idea what youre talking about im not white i grew up in public housing aka housing projects i went to a public school i paid attention in class instead of fucking around and got a decent education and applied to a more competitivebetter high school i worked my ass off in high school and did well on my sats do i wish i explored more material in high school and middle school for damn sure but that has nothing to do with standardized testing i had periods in school math history english gym science music etc i really wish i took home ec and learned how to cook or a coding class or a personal finance class but that has nothing to do with testing vs learning it had to do with public schools just not having the funding but funding comes from standardized testing no that funding isnt enough to make a difference in changing the entire curriculum simply put public schools just arent getting enough funding overall why its going to sound like beating a fucking dead horse but its because the us doesnt invest in education
Showerthoughts,removed,the plan was to allocate carrots as well but the political willpower dictated that they only allocate sticks

Showerthoughts,removed,hi guys check out this hilarious video hot girl farts in the car lol lol lol
Showerthoughts,removed,the truth is that being a successful school isnt always about how much money there is heres an example i go to a catholic high school with i believe a graduation rate we dont have tons of ipads or other gimmicks we just in the last year got chromebooks that the students pay for with an insurance policy on the other side of town many of the hood schools have tons of modern technology and resources but it doesnt work this is because ultimately it comes down to parenting if parents arent pushing their kids to be teachable and do their work then they wont usually even if a handful of parents raise respectful kids who want to do well they cant since the other of kids are rowdy and influence the good ones
Showerthoughts,removed,car commercials trigger me it should be illegal to sell anything as only for a hatchback without that much eqiuipment

Showerthoughts,removed,i dont know if it has already been said in this thread already but that system has been replaced during the obama administration what you are describing was the nclb system implemented by the bush administration as unedefaron said earlier have posted this in a few places but posting again because it needs eyeballs nclb is not the law anymore it has been replaced by the every student succeeds act essa testing is still a priority because it is used to help find underperforming schools and populations to receive more federal funding and attention and because research shows that testing actually is a pretty good teaching tool though it needs to be more frequent and with less consequence than nclb teaching however that testing can look very different state by state and the regulations now simply determine the kind of information that needs to be acquired with states figuring out how to do it there are also pilot programs to try and improve our ability to effectively measure competencies and provisions that allow for performancebased assessment ie replacing scantrons with experiential measures of higher cognitive abilities the education system has deep issues but the federal legislation is now moving in a better direction

Showerthoughts,removed,im talking bout being a kid not an adult that would be involved in robbery or violent crime robberies car theft ect which is why i say statistics arent everything yes crime statistics are better im not even arguing that its more of the fact that there were less people towns were smaller people knew you as so and sos kid ect it felt like we could wander around town safely or you could even say that it was just about parents and they didnt worry as much lol regardless we ran free you dont see that as much today you can argue all you like about statistics heres some statistics of the deadliest shootings in us history six have taken place since the newton school shooting will likely rank second on that list mass shootings appear to be on the upswing — even as other types of homicides and violent crimes are becoming less frequent david brooks highlighted this discrepancy back in july for much of the century there were on average a handful of mass killings per decade but that number spiked in and kept rising thereafter in the united states there have now been at least mass shootings in the past three decades with in the last seven years alone according to a recent mother jones survey this has happened even as the nations overall violent crime and homicide rates have been dropping there werent as many school shootings when i was a kid so theres a statistic that affects children directly for ya if thats what you are looking for because the rest kind of dont it could theoretically be safer by statistic but ask parents if they feel as safe having their kids running around town today as free as they did when they were kids

Showerthoughts,removed,it absolutely does fucking matter of victims do not know there attacker this is because most actual rapists who prowl the streets to rape people are crazy and just want to stick their dick in them try for one second to think like a fucked up crazy criminal there are girls girl is wearing a short mini dress with a lot of skin exposed and girl is wear pants with a belt and a hoody now you being a crazy rapist that doesnt want to get caught but wants to rape someone asks yourself who would be the easiest to stick your penis in the girl who you literally dont have to remove any of her clothing or the girl who you have to remove her belt and pants just to get it in there remember rapist are fucking scum that just want to put their penis in someone whom they usually find attractive would they chose the one who is dressed nicer and prettier or uglier with constricting clothing you people that argue this topic that clothing shouldnt matter always seem to forget that the people who rape others like im talking pushes people into alley ways and rapes them are fucking insane you try to push the narrative that all men want to rape chicks but in fact crazy messed up fucking criminals with mental illness are more often the rapists there is no rape culture but there are rapists they are crazy and usually commit crimes of opportunity while staking out locations like bars clothing matters only because lets be honest some clothing makes girls look fucking hotprettysexy as hell and it is male instinct to be attracted to the female body but almost all have forms of impulse control but as a worker in the mental health field i see many that dont and just seeing pretty girls really triggers and makes them horny and act out sexually they cant control themselves in a perfect world these people would all be in mental hospitals or going through therapy to try to change this behavior but mental health is such a taboo nowadays because people with these illnesses really help people like you push this narrative that all men are rapists but the world is not perfect if you are going to get drunk and try to walk home in sexy clothing at the riskiest time of day a mentally ill person with no impulse control might be triggered by your appearance and might rape you should this happen fuck no

Showerthoughts,removed,this when dogs were domesticated one of the big changes was convincing them to view humans as the alphas of the pack instead of more dominant dogs also fundamentally domestication is a process of genetic manipulation through selective breeding you breed the animals that show the traits you want to preserve and prevent the animals that dont show those traits from breeding this is why dogs are fundamentally different in appearance temperament size and capabilities to their genetic cousins like wolves the traits that make wolves wolves were systematically bred out of dogs if you were to domesticate a population of beatles fundamentally they would no longer be bears but another completely separate species

Showerthoughts,removed,i had a dream that i was in a crowded theater where a band was playing it was dark and there were flashing lights it was like a club that should have only held people but there were thousands i was near the front of the club and it was incredibly crowded and people were almost getting trampled the musicparty kept going sensing some sort of impending doom coming soon i ended up climbing the wall like a jungle gym rope or military rope in squares if that makes sense and getting to the back of the club to get near the door where it was much less crowded a fire went off in the front of the club and i quickly noticed and everyone started running out the back door the back door was filled with smoke from the fire although it only started about seconds before all of the sudden i was flash banged like out of a video game counter strike or call of duty and noticed islamic terrorists shooting through the smoke i was trying to run but realized while flash banged for about seconds that i was about to get shot and killed and there was no escape a few seconds later i woke up with a very stuffy nose and mouth breathingi figured this was my body telling me to wake up to get more oxygen i have nightmarish dreams such as the one described that wake up with me dying or some sort of deathwar involved only when my nose is stuffy and i have a lack of oxygen to my body one more example one was of nukes dropping while trying to escape a city for a random reason the nukes were so vivid and once i saw the air of the bomb coming towards me i stopped running from the blast and recognized my fate its kind of trippy for me when i am experiencing that feeling of knowing theres nothing you can do to stop your future death and these are the last seconds of your life that feeling is so calming yet so brief where i get a sense that i can just relax now but then i wake up lol

Showerthoughts,removed,government social worker here i am guessing you live in the us and are fortunate enough to benefit from our idea of health care health insurance free market depending on where you are there are possibly pro bono and usually sliding scale fee therapists pay what you can based on income also you could look into free support groups or therapeutic groups there are always toll free help lines too as for psychiatry it will not be easy without insurance as most doctors really like making money sometimes there are free clinics with humane doctors that prescribe frontline antidepressants and could give you samples it is tough as you would have to wait in line likely on a saturday with the rest of the marginalized i wouldnt expect them to do much in the way of more involved proper psychiatry however regardless i would call ahead dont get discouraged i know getting the foot in the door is the hardest part for most folks however it sounds like you want to get into some counseling any time i see someone impeded from mental health services due to a paywall it really grinds my gears if you need some help getting hooked up with mental health services it is what i do for a living so feel free to pm me

Showerthoughts,removed,id just like to interject for moment what youre refering to as linux is in fact gnulinux or as ive recently taken to calling it gnu plus linux linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day without realizing it through a peculiar turn of events the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called linux and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system developed by the gnu project there really is a linux and these people are using it but it is just a part of the system they use linux is the kernel the program in the system that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run the kernel is an essential part of an operating system but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system the whole system is basically gnu with linux added or gnulinux all the socalled linux distributions are really distributions of gnulinux olo

Showerthoughts,removed,there is a direct consequence of not brushing your teeth interestingly enough theres really not your breath might smell but for most people thats generally obvious to everyone else except themselves cavities take months or even years of bad dental habits before the worst consequences really manifest themselves in the shortterm it might seem rewarding to skip brushing ones teeth over the longterm though the ultimate consequence is pain or loss what at first seemed fun skipping brushing teeth the effects of which were obvious to everyone else stinky breath has finally revealed its consequences cavities and decay what an apropos metaphor for how sin takes root in someones life at first it seems rewarding but everyone else can usually recognize it for what it is blinded or ignorant we are to the truth we persist in our ways until the real consequences finally smack us upside the head at which point it is too late to fix the problem without some serious pain thankfully we have a spiritual dentist

Showerthoughts,removed,one of the episodes should be called the one where ross yells pivot
Showerthoughts,removed,im binging friends for like the time right now its actually playing right now most of them are not misunderstandingbased thinking of going through and describing each one but im on mobile and thats a lot of effort take season nine phoebe donates all her wedding money to charity decides she wants it back gets it back no misunderstandings monica makes thanksgiving dinner everyone except chandler intentionally and knowingly makes plans the same time and arrive late they try to apologize their way in but shes too mad to forgive them they smash down the door and knock over the table with all the food ross applies for a grant but the guy who awards it used to date his girlfriend he is being a biased jerk and makes it clear that he will give him the grant if he breaks up with his girlfriend he tells his girlfriend he brings her in to confront him grant awarder confesses and confirms that he did it all because he loves her she realizes she loves him too and embraces him ross is comically in obvious denial of what is happening rachels sister amy is a selfish jerk but rachel wants to help her anyway she insults everyone and in a pinch rachel allows amy to babysit her daughter emma amy gets emmas ears pierced to make emmas nose look smaller rachel kicks her out of her apartment rachel and joey are hooking up ross throws a party to show how cool he is with him dating he is really not cool with it he is a neurotic mess and it is painful to watch him struggle to pretend to be happy thats the joke watching him suffer ross goes on a date with a girl hes wearing black leather pants for the first time he starts to feel a little sweaty and goes to the bathroom he takes the pants off to cool down but then realizes he is so sweaty he cant get them back on at all he calls joey in a panic and joey suggests using baby powder to dry him out it doesnt worknow his pants and legs are covered in baby powder joey suggests lotion it forms a paste ross has smeared paste all over this legs and pants and still cannot get them on the girl gets concerned and asks if hes alright fully weirded out he exits and leaves fully knowing there is no talking your way out of this one the gang all buys in on a major lottery jackpot and they fight for the entire episode some episodes have misunderstandings yes but id say the ratio is like episodes where the plot focuses on a misunderstanding to plots that focus on nonmisundersrandings finally the biggest issue of the series we were on a break could be argued to not be a misunderstanding but a simple disagreement they both understand fully what circumstances happened rachel chooses to discredit the break they were on and ross clings to it frantically the show is designed so that disagreements like this arent onesided to make all the characters more likeable neither is actually wrong both sides make excellent points
Showerthoughts,removed,good you
Showerthoughts,removed,fun fact about that fear its actually an evolutionary left over from our huntergatherer days when the opinion your tribe members held of you literally meant life and death if you were poorly thought of the consequences could be as mild as getting the toughtochew portion of the nights dinner to no sexual prospects to possibly being kicked out of tribe altogether thats why we have an overblown inbuilt mechanism constantly worrying about appearances

Showerthoughts,removed,sort of yes and no on one hand none of the things i enjoy require that much money so i didnt spend it all on the other hand it feels really good to be able to just buy the stuff i wantneed without having to worry about how im going to be able to afford it when one of my old friends wants to buy a new notebook has car damage that needs repair moves to a new town and needs new furniture they have to save up for months or borrow from their parents or take a loan i just pay it from my bank account its a safety cushion im now and its now up to about but im not opposed to use a large portion of it some day i might use it to start a business use it as a downpayment on property buy a kickass car or have it available in case there is an emergency dont misunderstand me im not sitting on it like a dragon on a pile of gold my point was just to reinforce was op said those kids used to say the money i spent on the things i enjoyed were a waste of money yet they spent much more on the things they enjoyed and are now left with much less money for necessities as well as for enjoyment

Showerthoughts,removed,i would argue that long term thinking right now is almost impossible buy a house you mean buy a mortgage and pray property value dont plummet in the years it takes to pay it off jobs and careers are so unreliable that it is not safe to settle down anywhere investments are iffy because while in general over time the stock market has gone up god help you if you have to retire during a crash your investments are worth absolutely nothing until you cash them out in order to make any long term plans for the future you need enough stability in things to sufficiently predict what the future will be like i dont believe that is possible right now the best you can do is to be as flexible as possible which op is doing rather well eventually he will discover a life that is sustainable for him and settle down he wont need anywhere near the resources to retire as those who got the big house and the let me leave you with some questions about your future what if we return to doubledigit inflation right as you retire or is it deflation i forget which one totally screws you in this scenario what is medicare premiums double and the benefits are cut and your supplemental plans no longer cover enough what if property taxes skyrocket because your local municipality went bankrupt or if there is a major demographic change in your community i think its called gentrification

Showerthoughts,removed,high five
Showerthoughts,removed,honestly though it is as a guy i dont ask that question in the high hopes of hearing well i love buttsex blowjobs and shooting guns i really appreciate silence and have no intention of affecting your life adversely when i ask a girl something like what do you do for fun what is a secret you have whats a querk about you only you notice im really asking two things a what the fuck makes you unique b what are any flags that may rise not necessarily red flags if a girl likes harry potter i could reason she may enjoy star trek sherlock battlestar galactica and maybe even stargate thats means shes into my shows which means she and i probably have common interests in media important to any relationship other flags are important to notice too though for instance whats a secret you have well i once slashed a guys tires for breaking up with me he was such a jackass thoughbtw this is a real answer ive gotten yeah thats a red flag however it also means you take relationships seriously you are insecure enough to take rejection that far and you are probably a little clingy from this though i can figure i could probably trust this girl to not cheat on me probably i could probably count on you to do more dangerous things if i need you i could guess long term relationships mean the world to you which would mean youre probably interested in a family and marriage rather than adventures and spontaneous living really when a guy asks you a question about you they are handing you a paintbrush and telling you show me you if you lie or hold information back all thats really happening is he is getting a lil annoyed thinking youre either boring like genuinely boring or that youre not interested in him enough to share those thoughts as a guy im really just trying to learn how to read your mind enough to figure out if ill be happy with you what have you got to lose in showing me how to read it oh yeah and a lot of guys overthink things to exactly this extent

Showerthoughts,removed,how about kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,fuck that cunt im sorry you have gone through so much you will find someone perfect someday

Showerthoughts,removed,american dad
Showerthoughts,removed,but muhhh wage gap
Showerthoughts,removed,it flips really quickly too before you hit youll already be all oh my god when i moved out i was still a child
Showerthoughts,removed,the thing called seat i dunno what that means but the article goes into it a bit if you read it basically every airline is trying to come out with better and better seats to get a leg up on their competition they cant change the plane itself they cant make the flight any faster so the seat is one of the few things they can change to get people on board the seats cost money to manufacture but then you have to make changes to the plane itself in order for the seat to work ex rewiring the electronics or reinforcing the plane floor therefore by the time you add up how much youve paid overall to install new seats it breaks down to you paid per new seat in your plane
Showerthoughts,removed,society values that flight ten times more than it values a year of your work society doesnt give a shit the company that owns the jet does and theyre not going to give it out for free
Showerthoughts,removed,when i worked retail i had to go in when the local government had ordered all roads closed i asked our supervisor if the company would reimburse me for a ticket or vehicle damage and they said no maybe its state specific
Showerthoughts,removed,i think everyone is conveniently forgetting that in lotr god himself sends gandalf back from the dead even if dumbledore managed to kill him once theres no way he would do it again gandalf is like goku in that he only gets stronger
Showerthoughts,removed,thank god for the invisible hand of the market amirite
Showerthoughts,removed,that jet only costs millions because society agreed that it does dude what are you trying to say that complex machinery such as yachts high end sports cars and jets are just arbitrarily priced its not a purse

Showerthoughts,removed,i dont think its bs portland to phoenix charter is around each way

Showerthoughts,removed,the first time i met clint i thought he might be gay
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah but none of them are the dudes driving the trucks around the people who work in sanitation and make six figures are the people who make entire fleets of thousands of municipal sanitation trucks more efficient by tweaking routes or improving equipment or streamlining policies
Showerthoughts,removed,im an executive pilot and its pretty accurate fuel alone would be over for usaus plus you have a crew and lots of fees government tax and airport overnight stays i believe a company that large would have an aircraft already but its possible they paid for a private if its an unusual flight im not in the us but when i get a chance to see what my company charges for a flight its roughly dollars per kilometer flown so la to sidney in a midsize aircraft which is probably smaller in size what ops boss used would be each way aircraft has to go back to their base of operations eventually and the client pays for this
Showerthoughts,removed,and add in hotels and meals and a per diem for the employees star minimum so for australia that would be probably per day for the four employees inclusive plus aeroplane parking time so is about right but flying commercial to australia is a lot faster than private plus a private plane would need to refuel if flying from the us
Showerthoughts,removed,i used to call her lucy thank god i dodged that bullet

Showerthoughts,removed,thanks obama im going to miss you
Showerthoughts,removed,wait til the existential crisis sets in then the decades of existential depression
Showerthoughts,removed,also work in a call center in the south we dont get snow often but when we do its a big deal because we dont have salt trucks or snow plows governor declared stat of emergency the night before a few years ago a lot of people died during a snowy weekend and he wanted everyone home and safe so the same thibg didnt happen and was letting all nonessential government employees go home by a certain time the next day it rained and sleeted for most of the say and soon turned to freezing temps so the roads froze quickly the thing is my call center took volunteers to stay the night to take calls the next day with extra pay and no heating they never tell us of we are or arent going to get points for inclement weather and just say yeah itll be a point so they can get as many people to come in on the basis of fear instead of just telling us the truth they did not actually give points to anyone i went in and left as it started snowing but within a half hour all side roads were slick with packed ice the call center still doesnt take it seriously
Showerthoughts,removed,agreed while part of me thinks you shouldnt be able to vote until youve held down a hr a week job however if you can fight on the frontline for our country you should be able to shit you should be able to drink a cold one in imo at youre physically an adult but mentally and experiencewise not even close
Showerthoughts,removed,i was stoked when the wife bought us two new nerf guns for christmas
Showerthoughts,removed,there is no definite line of adulthood some people grow up at years old and others dont grow up even in their this is a legal term whereby it is assumed that you have enough conscious though process to know that your actions have legal consequences
Showerthoughts,removed,or hey if you cant decide now join the military and arm yourself with the worlds most powerful weapons to legally kill people with well even pay you youre old enough to be a hired killer
Showerthoughts,removed,this deserves more upvotes
Showerthoughts,removed,lets assume that it costs cents per lego brick it takes standard mason bricks to make a square foot so your house consists of a slab of bricks you dont have a house for you have a single slab of legos the cost to build a traditional new construction home is yes but that includes all the finishings plumbing electric excavation everything looking over these numbers it would be cheaper to build the lego home youre bad at numbers
Showerthoughts,removed,its maturity because your parents stop receiving child benefit from the government at least thats what my mother told me
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah i turned seventeen recently and then thought i could be driving now in a year ill be an adult in a year ill legally be able to get married what im not ready for that
Showerthoughts,removed,to me the biggest indications of maturity are being pleasant to others and critically thinking ive met stubborn adults whove lived by foolish ideas their entire lives and teenagers who are fairly enlightened
Showerthoughts,removed,it will maybe just not fully funded to meet current obligation levels but theres no shortage of infants being born that will be available for minimumwage retail jobs though theyll have to fight their elders for them
Showerthoughts,removed,or pissgate is evidence of that
Showerthoughts,removed,like if my pay isnt enough to feasibly replace my car if it gets destroyed attempting to make it in you shouldnt be allowed to make me come in under the threat of termination they arent making you come in you have every right to stay home you may get fired but nobody can make you come in to work
Showerthoughts,removed,most hospitals have procedures and policies that dictate that necessary staff actually stay at work to avoid having to risk the commute my husband is the executive chef at a local hospital and they actually put him up in a hotel right across the street so that hed be able to get there safely to do his job

Showerthoughts,removed,and the amount of offtheclock work you do as a new yr experience teacher is astounding youre making up lessons printables activities quizzes and tests prepping yourself for reviewing for standardized testing etc etc at least established teachers have some of these resources already available thats what i think contributes heavily to new teacher burnout you feel like you have to reinvent the wheel every week and create something spectacular this workload leads to you nto having much of a life for a solid couple of years and youre making less than your buddy working at home depot while also paying off student loans being exempt from overtime is pretty sucky too i got conscripted to work the buses after school my first year and was not paid a single cent for staying minutes late every day we also were not paid to be club advisors or detention room monitors although ive heard some districts do pay which is nice it just adds up to a question of how much you are willing to sacrifice to teach children that seem wholly and totally disconnected it can be rough i applaud those who have stuck it out

Showerthoughts,removed,if its utterly untrue why was it true for me are you saying people can lose weight while eating their tdee aka not dieting if you didnt lose a single pound that is because your caloric intake was too large for the amount of exercise you did yes obviously i didnt diet so i didnt lose weight obviously that means weight loss is diet exercise will increase your tdee so that you can lose weight more quickly but exercise alone will in no way make you lose weight saying weight loss is exercise shows a fundamental misunderstanding of calories incalories out no amount of exercise will make you lose weight if you still eat your tdee you have to eat less than you burn to lose weight

Showerthoughts,removed,i have no doubt thats going to happen convinced youd be banned but made the post anyway what an hero you are
Showerthoughts,removed,let me guess you are butthurt right now over something a mod just did
Showerthoughts,removed,wow nice shitpost whered you get banned from and what did you do to get banned mods are volunteering to do a shitty job they volunteer to help maintain a subreddit note they arent getting paid yet they are subject to all scrutiny directed at a subreddit think of your favorite nondefault sub actually imagine any subreddit that exists has existed or will exist every fucking subreddit will have some post usually in the top all time list bitching about how the subreddits quality has gone to shit since the glory days and the mods have done nothing but further the decline yada yada modding a subreddit is quite literally a thankless job and yields nothing but criticism for those who accept the role some subreddits are run by power hungry cancerous mods no doubt but the vast majority including the defaults are run by good regular people who just want to maintain good quality on their subreddit
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,dozen different accounts uhhuh wonder why you also needed two posts on the subject of mods every single one of your posts is just whingy and abrasive think you need to look at your own behaviour first

Showerthoughts,removed,the people that say that someone doesnt have common sense are usually saying it about a young person who amongst for someone in their generation has a common amount of sense the common denominator of sense comes from their generation which in turn leads to a senseless generation of men raised by women as a result of this many of todays children have birth defects that coincide with todays political world in addition children are also born with no testicular fortitude and lack masculine and feminine traits were the middle men of history man no purpose or place we have no great war no great depression our great wars a spiritual war our great depression is our lives weve all been raised on television to believe that one day wed all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars but we wont and were slowly learning that fact and were very very pissed off

Showerthoughts,removed,in jesus prophecy the world would be full of sinners thieves whores corrupt merchants and corrupt leaders so in effect maybe he would not have wanted children to grow up or become a part of that maybe thats what he meant i actually thought you interpretation was hilarious i never heard that before but something in me thinks that may have even been an intention
Showerthoughts,removed,its also a terrorist thing
Showerthoughts,removed,what
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,why does everyone keep ignoring that we already had equal rights i couldnt marry the same sex either if i wanted thats equality the exact same rights what you wanted was special treatment for your own perversions okay you got it now shut up about it already nobody cares its only an issue because gay people wont shut up about it as if every single other person in the world doesnt go through life every single day with secrets he cant tell other people because it would likely ruin their lives yes boo hoo cry about it some more but just dont do it around me my generation didnt tolerate whiny little bitches no matter your sexual preference
Showerthoughts,removed,should have just stayed quiet and enjoyed the view its ok though youll grow up one day
Showerthoughts,removed,r o a s t e d
Showerthoughts,removed,unless you seek confrontation and basically hope for some other person to intervene so you could legally murder that person i mean not saying i would do that but just imagine how easy that would be there is no clear premeditation here so youll easily get away with it with an average lawyer you probably could only do it once though or very least have to wait a decade for your next kill
Showerthoughts,removed,it seems like a good idea because they do
Showerthoughts,removed,the people who believe this are the truly selfish ones you want to kill yourself but what about me
Showerthoughts,removed,i also went to school with a guy who is in the nfl he was two years ahead of me but our entire school had kids in it so i knew him his little brother was in my class he was a teddy bear personified coolest guy you could ever hope to meet married his high school sweetheart and years later they are still together making millions he still comes back and does a camp at the high school for football httpsenmwikipediaorgwikikorylichtensteiger

Showerthoughts,removed,well i certainly wouldnt pay hundreds of dollars for that then why isnt there a service like that at restaurants where you can have your own personal waiter so you dont have to sit there hoping the waiter sees you waving at them

Showerthoughts,removed,clears throat i see this tired piece of misanthropic trash is still circulating around the internet this strawman is an attempt by feminists to make a gay issue into a womens rights issue providing a fallacious link between two similar patriarchal behaviors in an attempt to silence discourse and belittle lgbt problems as being part of a feminist struggle is at best disrespectful at worse subversive straight homophobic men who are uncomfortable being hit on by other men are uncomfortable because they dont know how to act in such a situation they have no social rubric for refusing unwelcome advances because no one fucking taught them how not their sex ed in school not their parents no one they are uncomfortable and hostile because hostility and fear are the default reactions to unfamiliar situations add into this the patriarchal power structure of men are in control of social interactions and the aforementioned homophobes dont feel any shame in reacting with hostility as usual the cure for a social ill is education not dehumanizing a group of people due to their ignorance or privilege

Showerthoughts,removed,anxiety is just a feeling that youre too big of a pussy to deal with any fucking thing in the real world either fucking kill yourself seriously or man the fuck up even if youre a chick

Showerthoughts,removed,i really care about a removable battery personally when i had my iphone it started having a lot of issues after about a year every so often the screen would go black and it would stay that way it would still vibrate when i got a text or switched the volume onoff but the screen was black and the only way to fix it was to disconnect the battery i couldnt use my powerlock button because it completely stopped working sometime before plus the home button rarely worked it was a struggle i finally dropped and cracked it and got an lg its really big but i like it
Showerthoughts,removed,dont care if you down vote me but i do care to know whats the reference may someone please explain

Showerthoughts,removed,on android it can vary greatly from brand to brand with their own skins to differentiate themselves some like motorola and sony retain much of the look and feel of the google nexus devices and add a few more system apps and custom features like the wave to wake gesture they tend to be smooth dont experience as much lag and are easier to update htcs gradually became like this from their much more customised skin others like lg and samsung change and add so much in terms of looks and exclusive features multi window was a unique feature of samsung until android added it on the system level some of these features feel like bloated gimmicks chinese brands like xiaomi and huawei go a step further and make their version of android look and act very much like ios they update these skins to add new features while leaving the base android the same
Showerthoughts,removed,upvote because i believe you actually had this thought whilst in the shower
Showerthoughts,removed,i miss my old it was a slider with a thick form i loved typing with the physical keyboard and the shapesize was ideal unfortunately it ran maemo and battery life became atrocious these days i dream how awesome it couldve been today with modern electronics efficiency an optimised android os and a bigass battery this is also why i was looking forward to project ara id assumed i could have a phone with a big battery but not necessarily a huge screen bring back the thick form factor
Showerthoughts,removed,i have a theory its planned obsolescence you cant replace the battery easily right it is known that the most damage to lithium batteries is from full charge uncharge cycles so what do you do you use battery capacity that starts degrading after two years because the battery capacity was always drained fully every day even with moderate use combine that with software based little nudges that make the phone feel sluggish with every update and you have a perpetual stream of demand for new hardware your core business combine that with the nonsensical small storage capacities and you see a pattern of intent emerge
Showerthoughts,removed,thats not how schrodingers cat works

Showerthoughts,removed,i work at a call center and we give a minute grace period where you can be late and not have it documented against you we would yell at the one who was late staying over is great but the employer schedules people when the employer needs them not being at work when you are scheduled is not made ok by staying after the end of ones shift

Showerthoughts,removed,a fair amount of people see androids as being trashy theyre cheaper typically not made as well typically dont look as good as an iphone of the same year and trashypoor people tend to use them more than iphones all of that combined gives the perception that androids are lesser phones for lesser people im an iphone user ive bought into that apple ecosystem i personally prefer girls that use iphones just because its easier to communicate i can text over wireless and from my laptop much easier as opposed to android where my phone has to have service and my housework is a dead zone ive used both apple and android windowslinux and os x the apple products that ive bought just tend to have a longer lifespan if you take care of them properly

Showerthoughts,removed,you are a shitty friend your friend hated themself so much they took their own life imagine what that must feel like but as long as you are happier who cares about your friend
Showerthoughts,removed,its selfish because most parents never get over the death of their child its selfish because if you have friends itll fuck them up for a while what youre doing by killing yourself is taking your pain and bequeathing it to everyone who cares about you we dont grow up in a vacuum were social animals and there are people who love us whether we want that love or not if you grew up in a relatively safe house and people invested money in your wellbeing its a dick move to kill yourself and make them suffer basically even if living for you is like swimming through mud every single day you suck it up and find something in this world that is somewhat tolerable and you just keep living one day at a time thats it you keep looking for things that distract you from wanting to die up until everyone who loves you is dead and then youre free to kill yourself thats the human condition for you

Showerthoughts,removed,if a parents thought is that a unique and interesting name will spawn a unique and interesting individual i got about destynys and tyfannys and madylynns that are evidence to the contrary i actually have a unique name and its actually pretty shitty in the era of the internet i hate how easy it is to find me and my family members i really dont think that these parents are thinking about all the wide ranging consequences of these ridiculous names to be clear i have a unique name because of the combination of the ellis island immigration officials and my grandfathers phonetics
Showerthoughts,removed,oh god
Showerthoughts,removed,but think about someone to carry on your family its so much rewarding to see them prosper in life too im just speaking from seeing other parents i know not a parent myself yet
Showerthoughts,removed,😉
Showerthoughts,removed,what people dont understand is that having kids changes you you become a different person your nuerotransmitter levels change your horomone levels change you become psychically and mentally different so its ludicrous for someone who hasnt been through that experience to comment on it they dont know its like a year old little boy trying to convince a year old teenager that girls are icky since he hasnt been through puberty his brain doesnt work the same same thing with year old hipsters who try to talk to parents they arent qualified
Showerthoughts,removed,if you think that humans should be exterminated start with yourself

Showerthoughts,removed,oh okaydegrees are cool but that isnt the only way to be successful more people should be learning trades instead of wasting their time on sociology degrees it is great to be the first to get a degree in your family but to actually do something impressive with that degree is how i view success either way i hope all of you turn out successful whether you go to school or not just contribute to society and we can be friends i despise welfare abusersbecause i have been forced to spend time with people who receive of what i earn every year but do nothing i would choose to do that to if i wasnt a lazy piece of shit yes it is less money but it is enough to live comfortable and they never have to work

Showerthoughts,removed,an addict is still an addict youre wrong here there is truly no objective way to quantify addiction it usually talked about in terms of how much it disrupts your life but that is always subjective furthermore heroin is actually not bad for you if its clean and taken in a very controlled and metered way the problem isnt the damage the drug does per se but the degree to which it causes addiction in theory if you kept use a very strict regimin it could be part of a healthy lifestyle

Showerthoughts,removed,when memory failed and written records were falsified when that happened the partys claim to have improved the condition of human lives had got to be accepted there did not exist and never again could exist any standard against which it could be tested in the end the party would announce that two and two made five and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make such a claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it not merely the validity of experience but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy saw this the other day and actually commited to memory though i have never read the book in full

Showerthoughts,removed,yes i pointed out the mons pubis as well in another comment however i was just pointing out the others bits of the vulva and personally think that using either labia or vulva is way better than saying i shaved my vagina it makes my lady bits flow rivers of tears i tell ya
Showerthoughts,removed,still relates to pedant
Showerthoughts,removed,however saying labia alone entirely overlooks the mons pubis perineum and anal area well then vulva lite

Showerthoughts,removed,um the human genome contains about three billion base pairs these can be encoded in two bits giving a total information content on the order of megabytes considering that any two humans share over of their dna one could further argue that the actual information transmitted by intercourse is on the order of megabytes which leads me to conclude that youre equipped with a fiber optic member or conveyed your story through port number two

Showerthoughts,removed,theres a difference between cultural appreciation and cultural apropriation cultural appreciation is taking part in a foreign or otherwise differing culture this entails both respecting that culture and understanding cultural facets or attempting to and significance cultural appropriation is the adoption of differing cultural facets without understanding the history or context and thus being unable to respect or correctly represent the culture or cultural facet appropriation is a problem because it tends to promote false and flat notions about a culture usually to the bias and whim of the appropriater this misinformation easily distorts peoples about differing cultures allowint them to more easily be otherized and marginalized it controls the reality and perception of people who take the appropriation as valid and given that appropriation gives no context beyond its own generally simplistic imagined view of that culture tends to be more easily digestable and thus more likely to be seen as valid its not about cultural exchange which is an inevitable consequence of differing cultures interacting over a period of time its about misinformation and simplistic worldview allowing people to be goaded more easily into marginalizing and oppressing minority groups and cultures the other aspect that is incredily harmful is the impact appropriation has in white washing and demoralizing minority groups such as natives who are surrounded and inundated by the appropriated history of their culture and its aspects words have a verifiable impact on the way people see the relations between themselves other people and their enviornment further being indoctrinated with this negative worldview or overly simplistic worldview of their culture and people can heavily impact who these people become and how they develop as human beings you simplify a complex situation and compare it to old racist rhetoric

Showerthoughts,removed,hey dont ask people this question if you dont want to know and if you do want to listen to them since you already recognize that theyre not doing well please rephrase that question something like hey i noticed youre not doing to well do you want to talk to me about whats going on will make a person feel alot more inclined to share as well as it will make them feel a fuck ton better after when youre asking your version of the question it puts a social pressure on the person implying i should be okay and everyone thinks i should be okay and they will lie to you so that they dont have to talk to you yeah im doing great although inside they want someone to talk to someone to help them talk out their irrational depression and anxiety
Showerthoughts,removed,couldnt we just make it categorically the absolute top imperative for the robot never actively harm a human no matter what such that all other functions are subservient to that and if any secondary function suggests violating the first injunction it refuses to engage in the action sure this might mean robots would be unable to harm a human in the small ways that we know we oughtsay giving an injection it can hurt a small prick of the needle but no robot could ever do that first command must be followed before anything else first command is never actively harm a human no matter what they would be capable of harm through inaction which is what we are talking about

Showerthoughts,removed,i understand but hes not here literally speaking to people like hes depicted doing in the bible
Showerthoughts,removed,the most obvious limits humans have are based in perception we like to pretend that what we see and hear is the real world but in reality that is just a model that our brain made up from interaction we had with the real world and it is full of holes the light our eyes can registers is just a of the electromagnetic waves out there but it gets worse even the colors we see dont represent the visible spectrum they are just a drastically simplified model same with sound touch and everything else if something is to small we cant feel it if sound is to high we cant hear it and so on when things move to fast our eyes cant distinguish them either water out of a faucet for example looks to us like a continuous stream in reality it is individual droplets
Showerthoughts,removed,this happens all the time my major is philosophy of science so i often end up explaining science to people science is a very complicated subject nobody actually even knows what it is so sometimes ill forget something and google it stumble upon an answer ill find a very detailed incredibly thorough comment with tons of sources and i think wow i cant believe this guy went through all the effort of writing this and only got upvotes for it if i had the money id gild this guy this is an incredible amount of effort ill private message him of course i eventually realize that its me dio i wonder why this is possible youd think that id remember when i spend like hours writing an explanation of a very complex concept
Showerthoughts,removed,yes i have experienced that dilemma before
Showerthoughts,removed,try to comprehend the dimension it is not possible
Showerthoughts,removed,the greatest world experience is if the surface youre on rolls up like a cylinder so you can walk straight so far you very magically start back at the beginning without any way to comprehend how it happened i use this example to explain how humans are completely blind to phenomena occurring in more than dimensions the dimension is time so the ability to move through time is as simplistic as rolling up a surface but we will never be able to achieve it from the limitations of our existence

Showerthoughts,removed,from the hadith abu dawud the messenger of allah peace and blessings of allah be upon him said whoever you find doing the action of the people of lot execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done altirmidhi sunan whoever is found conducting himself in the manner of the people of lot kill the doer and the receiver homosexuals are beheaded hung and stoned in modern saudi arabia and iran where muhammads laws are applied most strictly five other muslim countries also have the death penalty on their books for homosexual behavior in the past gays were burned thats just gay people as an apostate who has actually read all of it youre going to have a hard time arguing here it isnt about perception the quran and the hadith are very clear christianity has its downfalls the old testament speaks of a violent history and christianity calls for eternal suffering in the afterlife for disbelievers bad yes but not as bad as calling for the execution of them while they are still alive
Showerthoughts,removed,there was also that whole thing where he called to pledge allegiance to isil
Showerthoughts,removed,

Showerthoughts,removed,wow have you ever looked up gun violence statistics in every instance where a civilian has fired back the amount of crossfire damage and extra confusion went up by at least double and when every country that has outlawed guns has a mass shooting rate of about of the us dont you think we are doing something wrong what would have changed had someone had a gun in the club in orlando and had decided to fire back more people would have died there would be more active shooters involved and i guarantee the defending victim would accidentally hit more innocents this isnt the fucking wild west and more guns is not the answer
Showerthoughts,removed,i found another one
Showerthoughts,removed,not sure thats a fair metaphor being a mutant isnt inherently evil httpskepticsannotatedbiblecomquranintlonghtml whereas islam is inherently evil muslims around the world should applaud this guy for being what the quran says to do

Showerthoughts,removed,we accept people despite their radical ideological leanings you think that making women wear burkas exists in a vacuum no when you see a person declaring themselves a conservative muslim ie a wahabist zealot by wearing a burka theyve got a bunch of other backwards beliefs in muslim countries homosexuality bears the death penalty if a person is demonstrating their say saudi culture by wearing a burka do you not think they subscribe to other attributes of saudi culture like treating women like objects racism putting atheists to death and putting gays to death
Showerthoughts,removed,if there was a button that could kill all muslims when pressed id press it times to be sure

Showerthoughts,removed,i find it pretty obvious the year old boy will say something totally fucking stupid that is obviously untrue about a scientific subject then when questioned about it will claim to be an expert and provide no sources for their statements nor proof of their degree the expert will provide a sourced idea and back it up with the fact that they are an expert or add a commentary additional to their sourced information with their experience as a reason

Showerthoughts,removed,oki read your history you aint native american frat boy

Showerthoughts,removed,they get to touch them i used to work in an interactive museum that had a one of my colleagues was blind and he would often carm nice sounding girls into a tour thru the museum which always had a stop at the nail wall which would preserved her image for him to check out later

Showerthoughts,removed,i didnt realise how dangerous this poor excuse for journalism has become until an acquaintance was reported on extremely incorrectly his life is now potentially ruined when any journalist could have done minutes of research to discover the truth now hes sitting in an african jail and labelled a drug trafficker jaja his job is to manage imports of sugar and as a manager he is responsible for the containers that doesnt mean he knew anything about the small amount of coke hidden in one container from brazil that happened to be tipped off obviously because there are several larger shipments of coke in other containers shame on you bbc labelling him as drug smuggler in the headline

Showerthoughts,removed,politely i do not wish to spend all day researching about teen sex habits but i can pretty much guarantee you its a fact that teens will always have sex i did a quick search however from the late and early which seeing was years ago should count as a time thats not now a majority of us adolescent males report having engaged in genital sexual activities with females table in of males aged reported that they had ever engaged in vaginal intercourse that they had ever been masturbated by a female that they had ever received oral sex that they had ever given oral sex and that they had ever engaged in anal sex the proportion who had engaged in vaginal intercourse varies slightly from previously published statistics obtained in the intervieweradministered portion of the surely if you would like to spend an hour or so youll find its just as high or higher in the and reference gates g j sonenstein f l heterosexual genital sexual activity among adolescent males and cover story family planning perspectives
Showerthoughts,removed,i would assume its common knowledge because we were all teens once and most likely had some form of sexual intercourse in high school seeing that roughly more than of teens are sexually active according to that study in the then its safe to assume thats a lot of teens anyway you might find that teens are having less sex now than they were back in the prior generations i have nothing to back this up but with all the distractions and sex education around the rates are probably much lower today
Showerthoughts,removed,since you have a purse i assume you are a female a female that plays games is automatically awesome in my book what games do you play i assume witcher and other graphic intensive games

Showerthoughts,removed,the samsung galaxy note is still the newest and highest spec samsung on the market i buy it i love it after months i root it and custom rom it for the next two years i shit on apple for their specs repeating the often quoted lines like apple is for retards and i like the freedom to customise and apple specs are weak and devices are overpriced i was a rabid android fanboy the company i worked for gave me an iphone ugh fuck apple for the next few months i picked on the lack of free apps or the features i was used to in apps that ios versions didnt have but i started to realise small subtle benefits of the ios system the iphone has half the ram of the note wtf right but it lags less its utilisation of memory and applications is significantly more efficient this means less ram use and in turn means less battery use which means less battery required and means faster charging how do they do that its called the infinite loop apple oversee production of the hardware in their own dedicated factories and the operating system and the assembly they can ensure everything works together nicely like a restaurant that oversee the farming of meats and produce processing cooking assembly and table service comparatively samsung gets their meat from one farm supplier produce from another processing is done in a factory dedicated to processing for multiple restaurants and assembly in another they allow multiple vendors to handle and distribute the food too im sure many of you are thinking but samsung makes this or that part for the iphone true but apple has very strict quality control and oversight of these screens much stricter than samsung do for their own products also samsung makes hundreds of models of cellphone and tablet apple makes maybe a year perhaps youve seen the post recently quoting bruce lee dont fear the man who practices kicks once fear the man who practices one kick times samsung is the former apple is the latter then we need to discuss the operating system if you have spent any significant amount of time using both devices at the flagship level and and are asked to describe the difference its probably something like this ios is a mobile os and android is a desktop os ported to mobile if youre a gamer with both console and pc love its like playing a game that was made for console and ported to pc sure it works and you can do more on the pc version but something just doesnt feel right its clunky awkward not as smooth and natural play the same game on console and youll see the difference immediately the reason is simple on androidwindows you have a thousand variations of hardware the software is made to run as well as possible and your hardware is the limiting factor on iosconsole the specs are set in stone and the devs make the software to run as well as possible for those exact specs that means that in qa testing they know exactly what the user experience will be at all times and on all machines the difference this makes to the end product is phenomenonal so that is the difference between the two factions in the apple vs android and console vs pc wars both have benefits but comparing specs is a flawed measurement of which is better its like saying big macs are cheaper in india than nz where the meat and dairy is clearly superior

Showerthoughts,removed,first of all no one should be working fulltime hours a week and still be living below the poverty line in the richest nation on earth that is the main argument for a higher minimum wage you could argue that fast food or whatever isnt meant to be a permanent job but theres the reality we wish we lived in vs the reality we actually live in a lot of people rely on these jobs and will likely work them for the most of their lives thats not to say that a higher wage wont increase employeeemployer relationships if a worker feels that theyre actually respected and valued by their employer theyre much more likely to pride themselves in the work they do

Showerthoughts,removed,im always a bit hesitant with regards to websites with spiritual sounding names my suspicions are raised when at the end of the first paragraph after asserting many things they conclude with we can only speculate that when neural impulses reach the claustrum they emerge into conscious thoughts never mind that the paragraph hinges on this assertion it seems that they too have heard some of the facts but then went on to posit many things for which i see no basis from what i can gather so far our brain is made up from a dimensional schematic of electricity detectors which can change their sensitivity as a function of how often that signal is detected these detectors can also be set to a different sensitivity by other detectors detectors send their result its likely that i detected a signal by firing a signal to another detector the detectors are not prewired all the way only the basic functions that are genetically stored over millions of years of trial and error the autonomous functions everything in nature is in its purest form nothing but patterns our sense organs translate these to electrical signals within their limited range this range is limited due to chemistry this is also why we eat to not only grow our body but repair it and replenish the batteries if you will the patterns that we detect are overwhelming and confusing at first the most simple ones are easiest to store simply because they occur by far the most often for instance a photodetector in our retina can only fire when it detects a photon within a specific range of frequencies the detectors can be depleted they need to be chemically recharged first to be able to fire again due to the fact that the simplest signals get stored first and that they combine into a network that is not predefined no two brains are wired the same wiring decays after not being used for a while opening the detector up for another connection detectors can have multiple connections at once this system is not like a processor which does one instruction at a time in a really short time this is much slower but parallel and requires no central clock to synchronize all the parts of the machine the brain is limited by the speed of chemical reactions and the transport of new energy the wiring of the brain occurs bottom up if you could follow a single signal the further it sent on into the network to higher reasons the more other signals get combined at the neuron each neuron is wired to react to signals with a certain sensitivity that it has learned is effective the further the signal goes the more abstract the things are that these patterns describe a cell detects red its neighbour blue and another green gets combined to the pattern we call white a few of these white signals together might form a line this line can combine with other lines into a v the combination of these patterns might form a letter a more letters combine into words etc etc this abstraction reaches a point at a certain age where we start to get so abstract that it encompasses so much information at once that we label it a thought but it is still nothing more than neurons firing together
Showerthoughts,removed,my boss doesnt let me follow my motivations and interfere with ones outside of work sooo
Showerthoughts,removed,i think what upsets many people about it is the fact that its for entertainment purposes livestock abuse is for human survival and a relevant purpose unfortunately in many respects the livestock and farming industry is cruel however theres little alternative and pain and suffering can only be minimised not abolished yes im aware we could all just stop eating meat and animal produce but whats the likelihood of that happening in short i believe what pissed off the general public so much is that that could have most definitely been avoided

Showerthoughts,removed,i wonder if that sentiment is a modern reflection of one of postulated moral axes of humanity puritysanctity the idea that one achieves a higher moral status by denying themselves their basic inborn desires historically its traditionally been manifested as a way of demonizing sexual desires overconsumption etc however the things that this particular moral thinking gets directed at are traditionally things that need to be regulated for a smooth functioning society in the context of their era weve mostly gotten away with the need to demonize the traditional objects of scorn but one which we can now turn to is the desire to relaxnot work probably because humans have a higher access to leisure time than ever before

Showerthoughts,removed,it is though check the medical research ketosis infinite examples of why its a good idea diets dont work because most diets havent come of age and recognize the metabolic pathway conundrum of glycogen vs ketones soooo fat people keep consuming carbs keep spiking their insulin and therefore can never make progress because the cravings or work required to keep up with their diet is not feasible when the body is in starvation mode ie ketosis it conserves proteinmuscle mass burns your own fat stores for energy instead of glycogen do you understand how much glycogen calories we can store vs ketone calories and basically you feel satiated because the body is using its own fat stores for energy this is really the only way that most fat people will be able to lose weight people like you who reject the science without understanding an iota about it are part of the problem and the reason that our medical community well the other reasons involve greed corporate sponsorship and lack of education yes even doctors have a lack of education have not yet come to the realization that fasting is the safest most effective way to rid of excess damaging body fat

Showerthoughts,removed,if you arent attracted to obese people you arent attracted to obese people you arent bodyshaming and i have no idea how this would be misogynistic you have little control over who you are attracted to and attempting to force yourself to be attracted to someone just seems unhealthy now saying that there is a real issue where women are judged more so than men on their appearance reddit shows this perfectly find a picture of a woman will probably be a number of comments about her appearance often if debating if she is attractive or not this is much less common with pictures of men an extension of this is that women who are overweight often have their weight talked about often in a derogatorily manner more so than men do societal standards are harshly weighed against women who are deemed overweight and when it comes to fat shaming particularity online although men can and have been targets it does seem to be heavily weighed against women this is why fat shaming is often addressed as an expression of misogyny the act itself is not intrinsically misogynistic however due to the societal focus on a womans appearance fat shaming of women can be seen as an extension of that

Showerthoughts,removed,wrong i believe you are the one who doesnt understand how life works the first marriages to fail are the ones where sex ends or becomes a chore im sure that she didnt mind taking care of his needs at the beginning but some time down the line something changed this failure to admit that men need affection is what is causing failed families eleanor roosevelt hated sex but understood that it was necessary and told the women of america that it was something to be endured this lead to large families and prosperous times ive been married a long time and ive seen first hand other relationships of friends and colleagues and it is always the same reason
Showerthoughts,removed,women tend to stay in abusive relationships for a ton of reasons google searches would show the most obvious being economical lack of safety nets and ect the problem is that in most situations it requires a true friend to help the women almost force them to leave instead this persons friend is posting on an internet forum to further her belief that all sex is rape or that you can be married and not have sex several times a week and expect everything to be ok
Showerthoughts,removed,well its obvious that the topic is close to home for you you have guilt that you cannot help your friend right now but there are things you can do depending on your states laws you could record the husband being abusive verbally calling her names or the children names and yelling this evidence will help you when you turn to a lawyer for custody of her children im sure the reason she has doubts of leaving is due to that next call your states abused women hotline its a very easy google search next you need to in confidence tell your friend that you have started the ball rolling and with our without her help you are going to get her out of the situation this is the only way you can help your friend not unlike ripping off a bandage
Showerthoughts,removed,fyi cmdaltesc
Showerthoughts,removed,this is the first time ive done one of these for a post and not a comment but it was too good not to

Showerthoughts,removed,im on my phone now but i remember seeing the data that much much less people did end up burning themselves then youd expect what i said was that under the theory that the water was not boiling etc you would see no one get burned edit it came from this paper httpwwwpeterleesoncomordealspdf i didnt read every word of that but it looks like its just presenting a mathematical model and using trial by ordeal to make it more interesting as opposed to seeking historical accuracy i didnt see any data in there about rates of burning
Showerthoughts,removed,if the shoe fits apple are a bunch of jackoffs

Showerthoughts,removed,are you fucking sorry
Showerthoughts,removed,uroostercheese isnt insulted because someone has a different opinon than him hes insulted because hes actually being insulted flat earthers dont merely hold the standalone idea that the world is flat believing that the world is flat requires that you subscribe to host of other outlandish ideas in order to prop up your world view the most important of these beliefs is that there is an intricate and enormous global conspiracy to hide truth from the public consequently those professions which roostercheese mentions whose jobs rely on the earth being a sphere would be in on the conspiracy flat earthers arent disagreeing with those people theyre calling them liars and theyre not just regular ol liars theyre a grab bag of elitist new world order free mason illuminati overlords that are hell bent on enslaving the human race i wish that were hyperbole if youve never done so i encourage you to watch some to get a better sense of how deep the rabbit hole goes for a lot of these people youll realize pretty quickly that disagreeing with their pet conspiracy theory just proves to them that youre a closedminded sheep who needs to wake up

Showerthoughts,removed,cop out
Showerthoughts,removed,it is true that the world order for the last years had swung in the favor of europeans due to advancements in science technology medicine agriculture industry warfare etc europe had to develop many of those technologies because of the islamic threat of conquest and genocide for the years before that prior to that time muslims had conquered and then mass murdered europeans in north africa the near east and turkey in one of the greatest genocides in history the europeans blamed the jews for those islamic conquests for example madrid was taken because jewish conspirators let the attacking muslim armies into the gates in constantinople jewish conspirators helps take the city and were handsomely rewarded after the conquest before that alexandria egypt which was the seat of european civilization in north africa had fallen to arab muslims because jews had given intel to muslim generals so they would know where to attack many european civilizations were destroyed and their women and children were taken as slaves which jews facilitated the trade to fill every harem in the middle east with white women and children including boys who were subjected to horrible sexual tortures our word slave comes from the word slav which the muslims took millions of slavic slaves when the conquered the russian steps further if it were not for reconquest of southeastern europe by slavs there wouldnt be any white people there either why dont you care about those civilizations and people the genocide of their civilizations far outweighs anything the european ever did what about the mass genocide of zoroastrians pagans buddhists and hindus in persia and west central asia to the point were their culture has been wiped from the earth why dont you care about them the jews were persecuted no one denies that and it was wrong i dont blame them for conspiring against germans i can imagine the hatred they have for goyim and why they seek their destruction however the germans were wrong to persecute the jews even despite that hatred they should have helped them gain back their homeland from the muslims
Showerthoughts,removed,no offense but this just reeks of oversensitivity selfimportance and pretentiousness theres a very small vocal minority of usually older people who dont like it but thats to be expected of anything especially anything new its a silly fun little game with a gimmick drawing massive societal and worldview conclusions based on extremely limited interactions based around it is pretty silly in my estimation
Showerthoughts,removed,it has nothing to do with anarchism at all they are a bunch of morons whove tried to steal the word anarchy because they think it makes them sound cool when thry dont know the thing about anarchism
Showerthoughts,removed,stop fucking reposting this you dumb fuck oh and look what we have here a word for fucking word post that hit the front page a year ago you are a scumy cunt

Showerthoughts,removed,would definitely be interesting to see peoples reactions especially on gummy bears like haribo or any other candy really but if youre able to do a little math its not really hard to calculate how much kcal or fat a whole damn thing has since theres always stated how much fat etc your food contains per just add it up by or etc if were talking about eg drinks if americans use different measurements i feel sorry for you 😅
Showerthoughts,removed,its like they hired the onion to direct the whitehouse
Showerthoughts,removed,fuck you tyrannical fucks let the people speak freely assholes
Showerthoughts,removed,great competition right here a funniest craziest newsclips of

Showerthoughts,removed,oh did i mention anything about assault like the guy below who had coins thrown at his face mentioned the vast majority of replies in this whole thread are about people dealing with unreasonable companies trying their very best to avoid their responsibilities to their customers and a lot are saying that an angry customer deserves no help of course theyre angry after having been given the runaround by people whose job is clearly meant to give him the runaround so all it takes for you to troll and even create more problems for a customer already probably at his wits end is a raised voice and a few hurtful words
Showerthoughts,removed,someone needs to core a few states the overextension is getting ridiculous
Showerthoughts,removed,allowing the media to bob my head upanddown on puppet strings is also a weekend plan every sunday i exercise my brain in a good teamthink ritual by accepting everything that falls within my reality and rejecting everything that doesnt every new anecdote feeds into my polarization feels good knowing i am not a sheep like the other team so true aint it

Showerthoughts,removed,but that fact checker sometimes didnt read the article
Showerthoughts,removed,the best way to know is to look at the eyes if they are dilated then they are interested or just really high
Showerthoughts,removed,though it would also be really weird thus why whenever i actually express myself i am fucking ostracized i want people to know how im feeling though but because of how im treated when i do whether i have positive or negative emotions ive had to hide them even if i wish i was dead i have to hide them so instead the internet has to bear my feelings
Showerthoughts,removed,hey there friend fuck you too
Showerthoughts,removed,im sort of new here but heres my try yes it is and youre a poopoo head ad hominem attack if it werent for the liberal media we wouldnt even need these discussions metaarguing howd i do
Showerthoughts,removed,well if clinton had won it would have been brutal president clinton which one the one who came after bush which bush
Showerthoughts,removed,unless theyve invented perfect filters youre getting millions of poo particles
Showerthoughts,removed,i think its really important to keep in mind that the people who spam the front page with those stories know that the top earliest highestweighted comments will often frame the story in a certain way in order to control the interpretation at any point the cure for misapprehending what actually happened is reading the article critically because these days its quite possibly total bullshit too
Showerthoughts,removed,unless youre committing suicide and know that you wont pussy out
Showerthoughts,removed,rchangemyview might be the sub youre looking for i poked around in it once it wasnt bad not great either but perfection is likely unattainable for something like this
Showerthoughts,removed,thank you op for being honest and this is exactly why reddit is an echo chamber
Showerthoughts,removed,this is exactly why certain organizations a la ctr are paying millions to have people posting on reddit to promote certain narratives and make them look like the real opinions of average citizens
Showerthoughts,removed,its not insipid shit just dont assume that some things appeal only to boys
Showerthoughts,removed,the worst is all the pictures posted on social media with lines like my dog is so happy he is smiling see while in most situations the facial expression most similar to a human smiling almost always shows he feels distress terror or pain

Showerthoughts,removed,always late to everything someone always sums it up but politics though
Showerthoughts,removed,his or her ftfy and you need to use some degree of intuition we arent machines after all we can question our bias is we choose to the cool part about bias is that theres usually two sides to it somewhere in the middle is some agreed upon truths and from there you can research your way to a reasoned response hell sometimes you just need to watch the fucking source video remember when cnn and msnbc said trump was trying to get his supporters to kill hillary i watched that rally live and it was blown so far out of proportion and i agreed with what he said i didnt vote for the guy but its irritating that liberal media does that sort of thing always
Showerthoughts,removed,damn furries are everywhere now

Showerthoughts,removed,since homosexuality in muslim countries is punishable by death then the two bans are the same thing

Showerthoughts,removed,actually this severely bothered me as a kid im a girl owned a gameboy color gameboy advance and a gameboy advance sp i was always waiting for a gamegirl to come out i understand youre making a joke and i accept the down votes but honestly the whole thing bothered me as a kid kinda hard to argue i have a right to play video games as a girl when the thing literally has boy in its title

Showerthoughts,removed,so you like movies about hitler set in worlds where everyone has a tattoo andor number floating above their heads and also everyone has a power but your power is the most specialest of all
Showerthoughts,removed,so much
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah fuck you and your stupid comment you just took the top comment and regurgitated it its literally not even a reply to what i said im deleting my initial comment because youve only cheapened it the world doesnt deserve an original thoughtso just enjoy this rerelease of the top comment everyone you fucking sheep
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont work in it i think theyre socially awkward fuckheads who also shouldnt have kids
Showerthoughts,removed,alright honest question how do you feel about this playlist im expirimenting here
Showerthoughts,removed,politically absolutely
Showerthoughts,removed,even though it can be nice at times for various reasons like for me i forget movies or shows so i can rewatch them again for the first time i dont even remember any event that happened prior to i can think of the event but i dont remember it for instance i know i celebrated christmas with my family but i dont remember any actual christmas like how i can remember i opened the chocolate cake last night to eat itits more fragments as i age and the fragments are in a fog where the fog gets denser and denser i only remember the outcome of what was likely to have occurred so in a sense im remembering my childhood based on how kids are likely to spend christmas with their family and injecting myself into that picture to think of how it might have occurred rather than how it really occurred and my teenage years is starting to do the same i thought it was normal to i realized how many people could recount so many details up to their childhood also the biggest problem is dating i have to really tell whomever i am dating that i really have a memory problem and please not to take it personally people often get irritated when i ask them me a question then the next day i ask the same question also because of my past denial that i do have a memory problem i often got into big fights with my ex because my memory would combine with something else so i would say i know for a fact you did that only to be absolutely wrong everytimefuckingtime now my biggest problem which my doctor said is normal maybe it is but doesnt sound normal i have dreams that sort of inject themselves into my memory when most of us wake up we know hey that was a freaky dream but for it was im so glad i cleaned the kitchen today only to realize i never did and dreamt it thinking i did it in real life same applies to paying bills and host of other things tldr memory loss is good for movies novels things you want to experience over and over for everything else theres mastercard
Showerthoughts,removed,no it wont hitler actually wrote his book
Showerthoughts,removed,no but luke is responsible for vaders death his unwillingness to turn to the dark pulls vader back to the light also switching sides at the end doesnt automatically make you a good guy when people talk about vader they still talk about him as a bad guy i mean hitler killed hitler does that make him a good guy

Showerthoughts,removed,tell me about it those psychology today articles seem to always make it worse your coworker is trying to reverse double manipulate you with expert fashion counter attack it this way there are people who believe this religiously
Showerthoughts,removed,only genders
Showerthoughts,removed,how is a sign not civil ive never seen a rioter beating someone with a sign if someone is protesting and they are occupying both of their hands with a large awkward sign that cant be swung with force and would mess up their aerodynamics if they try to run you can probably bet that particular protester is not going to do anyone any bodily harm
Showerthoughts,removed,i think just the center light should flash when abs engages right now a lot of cars flash the center brake light whenever the driver steps on the brake pedal i think this ultimately desensitizes people to the flashing whereas if it meant something standard on all cars that flashing would be meaningful i also think rear turn signals should only be amber and never red red turn signals seem to be a north american thing
Showerthoughts,removed,you are incorrect i have definitely seen this in the us as recently as yesterday it was bothering me i cant quote you the makemodel of every car that has it but i have seen it fairly regularly

Showerthoughts,removed,theres also not as much motivation for phones most people are happy with stock cellphones now streetracers gearheads criminals and speeders thats a huge market
Showerthoughts,removed,in the star wars prequel trilogy they wanted to make look brand new but he was so shiny the camera was visible they had to dull down the metal before shooting to still look new but not so reflective
Showerthoughts,removed,actually yes at mph is equivalent to a little over kmh which is above all speed limits anyway that means youre going at deers have a top speed of kmh which means meters per second at top speed according to httpswwwquoracomhowwideisatypicaltownroadintheus typically lanes are meter wide on highways since side lanes are usually as wide as a lane and since youre on a highway at that speeds its possible that youre overtaking someone that means youre on the leftmost lane so the deer has to run m before hes even in your lane lets say the deer is at max speed meters per second that means it takes him half a second to be in your lane if youre going at when the deer showed up on the road you had meters to react which admittedly isnt much however were also assuming that the deer is running full speed against a barricade for no fucking reason
Showerthoughts,removed,funfact theres no correlation between homework and development of knowledge or academic performance its all just theater for the parents and status quo that noone dares challenge norway i think abolished homework as a concept and their education performance improved on the flip side i find that i study way more after work than i ever did in school the main difference is that i now look for my own books and sources based on where i have knowledge gaps
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont even get mad when my son forges my signature when i am busy finishing up my own studies or just doing singlemom shit you werent in a position to have children in the first place and now you are dealing with the consequences of that i feel sorry for children born into situations like this the didnt ask to be born
Showerthoughts,removed,exactly these are lazy parents who never should have had kids to begin with and now they are whining about how hard it is to be a parent they should have kept their clothes on
Showerthoughts,removed,which is why you are an idiot
Showerthoughts,removed,you are a bad parent now stop sucking at parenting and deal with the choice you made
Showerthoughts,removed,email from my admin to whole school saying reading in class is a waste of time tell us this person name so we can slap the stupid out of him i remember reading in class and sometime being told to stand in front of class to read even if we were shy or fuck up the teacher would allow us to go on our own pace if we think our generation is a bunch of antisocial freaks then the upcoming generation would look like mole people
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah they shouldnt have had kids to begin with most single moms suck at parenting and love to toot their own horn like they should get a noble prize because they got fucked lol hey you got fucked by a guy who didnt want to hang around you and were too stupid to abort now deal with it
Showerthoughts,removed,actually you are and the person i was responding to should have never had kids they arent cut out for it
Showerthoughts,removed,you need to look up the word hypocrite idiot lol
Showerthoughts,removed,its your opinion that it is overburdening to them cite the studies that show what you are saying is true also what is your definition of good results you are just making shit up
Showerthoughts,removed,dont listen to these people here they are bad parents many of them women who were trying to latch onto men by getting pregnant and it didnt work out for them
Showerthoughts,removed,classes last year of high school i had first year all of professors act like their subject is most important it was so hard
Showerthoughts,removed,the only reason i wish i was taller is that it would make it easier to pee in the sink

Showerthoughts,removed,have you even applied to colleges yet
Showerthoughts,removed,hen i was in grade the teachers would give us a lot of homework on monday for some reason my mother would tell me the teachers did this to spread the assignments throughout out the week bullshit most of these assignments were due on tuesday i highly doubt your teachers were assigning graders homework with a single night to do it
Showerthoughts,removed,some teachers simply do it out of spite no they dont this is so pathetic its sad thinking the you are learning discipline and focus no they are trying and unfortunately failing to teach petulant fools like you those traits
Showerthoughts,removed,neat so at best you have half a dozen instances to draw from
Showerthoughts,removed,you are confusing nothing of substance with nothing that agrees with you now ask yourself is it more likely that you or i are correct given our education and experiences
Showerthoughts,removed,no offense but im a research scientist my entire career is choosing between being less good at one thing or another because there is always more to read or write its an adult thing to accept that you cant be all things at all times and honestly if you cant handle the workload you dont belong there that is reality
Showerthoughts,removed,have an update mister manager
Showerthoughts,removed,just because you couldnt cut it doesnt mean the other kids didnt benefit the thing i love most about redditors is their total inability to even entertain that they have failings
Showerthoughts,removed,first i couldnt give a single shit about what you think second it is incredibly fun winding up selfimportant redditors while i drink a beer and watch narcos third your account has comments two of which are conspiracy bs so ill reiterate my first point i dont give a single shit what you think
Showerthoughts,removed,sounds like an excuse to me
Showerthoughts,removed,when i worked at popeyes i ate more from there than anywhere else mostly because i could get free food it was the food that was not able to be sold to customers yet was still good apparently minutes after it came out of the frier qualifiies the fiod as unsellable to the customer it still tasted pretty good

Showerthoughts,removed,milelong rote memorization homework is total bullshit learning should be interesting and fun or at least in some way engaging not something kids invest more in avoiding than they do in studying for
Showerthoughts,removed,i have the same commute just about minutes in and up to hours out it varies sometimes i can do in and out and sometimes its in and out etc but the worst ive had so far in months was round trip yeah it sucks and its hard on my car gas and tolls but i get paid enough not to care i get weekends and every major holiday off honor based sick leave no limit to how much sick time if you are actually sick also get decent vacation excellent health insurance free dentalvision and excellent matching i also have a flex schedule so i can go in anywhere between and and leave between and if traffic is bad i can just relax and not worry about it stop and chill at and get some coffee and eat something if i get in after its not a big deal i just stay a little after unpaid lunch its actually pretty relaxing since im never in a hurry
Showerthoughts,removed,this is an riamverysmart goldmine thank you kind stranger
Showerthoughts,removed,my favorite one of these is in the movie maximum overdrive in the scene a semi truck with a giant flat chrome bumper is pulling out of a parking lot the camera is shooting from the front in the bumper reflection you can clearly see a pickup truck with or people and the camera i wouldnt be surprised if they all had to get their sag cards they were on camera so long
Showerthoughts,removed,because fuck you and your happy life go kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,as someone who didnt get homework until grade i agree even when i did start getting homework regularly i usually refused to do it barely passed most of my classes when it came to highschool this changed nothing because i already knew what i needed to learn for my chosen career path
Showerthoughts,removed,following your logic you can compare oxygen to heroin they are both addictive they both cause the death of cells and they both cause death if you suddenly quit after years of use heroin is far far far worse than alcohol both can ruin your life but its waaaaay easier with h

Showerthoughts,removed,fuck you
Showerthoughts,removed,why the downvotes if you had the choice of having your kids in a school that teaches them to take a test and do as theyre told or the choice to send them to a school that teaches them to think critically what would you choose we didnt stick them in the school so they could be future leaders we chose a school that had a similar philosophy to us
Showerthoughts,removed,not sure if this is really the right way of looking at it domesticated dogs have a dramatically shorter lifespan than wolves in captivity their closest relatives i am a genetics student so my mind jumps straight to the idea that domesticated dogs do not have the kind of genetic diversity needed to eliminate or minimize recessive traits from the gene pool
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah europe doesnt have nearly as many minorities as the us does yet
Showerthoughts,removed,holy aspergers batman
Showerthoughts,removed,at this point in my life i can just walk by a cop with an eighth in my pocket and casually nod hello to them without even thinking about the weed on me im in a state where its still illegal as well dont let cops get you nervous man
Showerthoughts,removed,you are in your funny thats how many times i banged ur mom last night
Showerthoughts,removed,im not saying i dont want to drink nowhere have i said that in fact i happen to be catholic and alcohol is an important part of our religion so theres no way im not drinking my problem isnt alcohol its drunkenness and there is a point where slight insignificant intoxication begins the transition towards drunk you should be able to stop before that point
Showerthoughts,removed,because you almost certainly have kind of a big problem nowdays is the fact that there are so many laws on the books basically everyone is guilty of something
Showerthoughts,removed,you should check out minority report
Showerthoughts,removed,american politics are so polarized and predictable i can know each sides comments to almost any subject before i read them
Showerthoughts,removed,firstly that doesnt mean they were all caused by the alcohol impairment just involved so if a drunk dude is sitting at a red light and somebody rear ends the alcohol was involved but not actually a factor not that i advocate driving impaired at all secondly just because of accidents involved alcohol that doesnt mean that of people who are drunk are also driving
Showerthoughts,removed,yeah i get thats the point of the discussion but youve still missed the biggest point would you buy that car i wouldnt and i have family who are big car enthusiasts and they sure as fuck wouldnt selfdriving cars are already very unpopular among car enthusiasts add on that it doesnt always consider your safety first and this transition is going to be very slow or impossible i wouldnt buy a bullet that turns around and hits me if some idiot walks out into the range and i dont really see the difference besides that my point about the far future is just that we can reach a point where that kind of programming is unnecessary or at least so infrequent people would take the risk for the indisputable extra safety it wont help us get to that point if we start making cars solve moral dilemmas though
Showerthoughts,removed,think about it logically spiders which decide to crawl into a persons mouth dies natural selection much

Showerthoughts,removed,jimmy are you watching furries again
Showerthoughts,removed,i always assumed viewer discretion is advised was the politically correct way to say this is going to be fucking awesome unless youve got a moral stick up your ass
Showerthoughts,removed,could take you over to mckinney tx and see how that works out for you
Showerthoughts,removed,unarmed doesnt mean shit if you charge or threaten a cop plus the cop doesnt necessarily know that someone is unarmed michael brown was a huge fucking dude who could easily kill with his hands but the cop should have just shot his legs right if youre charging someone or threatening someone where they fear for their lives you only have yourself to blame if you get shot

Showerthoughts,removed,haha you mean the black grocery store you racist there isnt really a bad part of town for us but if there were it would be the albertsons mikes away fred meyers is in a fairly average area
Showerthoughts,removed,i agree with you in that returning to college is not necessarily a haven to require more skills in a specific profession but i disagree with your notion that the quality of life is much better once specialized in a profession homework is not a reversed departure from reality but either a simulation of reality as a professional or a means of utilizing the closing timeframe for a young brains plasticity to its extent as well as maximizing societies investment in their education for high school because its our last chance to educate teens before granting them electoral voice and adult privilege this is of course entirely based upon the profession as a surgeon well into his training as a neurosurgeon i can tell you that i spend far more time at home reading papers reading textbooks and writing manuscripts and grants for research in my off time than i did studying or working as an undergrad and i worked my ass off in college and medical school i dont know what life is like as a software programer but in my field it takes decades to reach mastery and only so little time if you read and study religiously in your off time you would simply fail to succeed if you didnt study at home with potent dedication i am salaried however so maybe that is the difference i am expected to demonstrate continued significant improvement and there is too much work to be done during the to hours straight that i am physically at work to gain this competency and so i am expected to study in my off hours i am a bit of a unique player though and a exception of my own statement for me schoolwork is very similar to my jobs requirements because part of my job is education essentially i am paid a small fraction of my value as an employee i make about a year and earn the hospital well over a million a year in consultation and procedure costs without supervision because i am paid hundreds of thousands in masterful education yearly m

Showerthoughts,removed,no disrespect to your profession but this is an awful analogy my understanding of cells is that they are autonomous and machine like similar to a computer program they function without discretion humans are not like this white blood cells are efficient but their not rude condescending or emotionallyracially abusive towards other cells police being assholes makes their job much harder it seems it fosters resentment distrust and noncompliance i dont have any numbers to support it but it seems intuitive that more positive interactions with police would lead to more compliant trusting and engaging citizens this seems to be the case in northern european countries where police treat people with dignity and respect while still being effective

Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,thats not what i meant and i dont think its what i said also its weird you said gently fucking you while asleep obviously id rather be raped than die the consequences are worse but the intent may not necessarily be worsebut it still could be worse the capacity to get a hardon and fuck a struggling or passed out victim against their will is unfathomably evil i cannot understand how someone is capable of doing such a thing someone who does is without question a horrible human being the second i hear about someone being a rapist i think theyre scum murder on the other hand can be committed by a wide variety of people i actually wonder if anyone given a very specific set of circumstances isnt capable of murder im not saying that murder is okay or that there arent a lot of the worst people imaginable who are murderers what i am saying is that in very specific circumstances i can understand committing murder even a murder done in the heat of passion though not excusable is easier for me to grasp murder can be a mistake and yes people should still suffer the consequences but rape cant be a mistake plus there are clearly people who deserve to die im not gonna do it because im not violent and i dont want to go to jail but if someone murdered martin shkreli or hitler or a serial rapist id be all for it if someone raped themthats a too fucked

Showerthoughts,removed,not really im very talkative i like sharing stories and i like being told stories and anecdotes funfacts etc when someone is super quiet around me it sort of feels like they arent contributing or like im just here to entertain them or that they dont like me ifwhen i finally say how come you are so quiet its because at that point im bored of talking to myself and while they may be having a good time just listening im not im not having a good time just talking the implication is i respect that you dont like talking that much but you could have done that at home alone i dont like dealing with long silences and id really rather spend the night with someone who feels engaged not someone that for whatever reason acts like they are too cool for school people that only want to listen as just as bad as people who only want to talk except that it feels like people who talk too much just want to impress people around them while annoying is still forgivable but people who are too quiet make you feel like they think they are too good for you or the situation which is less easy to find charismatic just my two cents
Showerthoughts,removed,so ew cringe

Showerthoughts,removed,thats a really good question and its hard to have an answer for every situation i honestly think that if every lawabiding citizen was armed it would decrease the risk and overall amount of gun violence i think people would be more polite and less likely to engage in dangerous and inflammatory interpersonal behavior if they knew they were in the company of individuals who happened to be armed call it mutually assured destruction on a smaller and far more personal scale beyond that most gun crimes in america happen in gunfree zones schools nightclubs etc imo we see a lot of the gun crime happening there specifically because the shooters knows there is a much smaller chance of facing opposition in the form of an armed bystander theres an old joke if more guns more violence how come theres never a mass shooting at a gun show or nra convention more guns doesnt equal more violence in the right situation more guns equals no violence further the kind of person you dont want to own guns gang members outlaw bikers drug dealers etc probably already do theyre already armed theyre already skilled in the use of a firearm theyre already likely to have a penchant for violence in the right situation all this is stuff im pulling straight out of my ass like i said these are my opinions not facts i take your question seriously uexistentialfluff so thanks for asking you can pm me if you want

Showerthoughts,removed,sure i could have pranked anyone but i specifically chose those houses because i knew who lived there because i could look it up in the phone book just like if i wanted to stalk the girl who worked at the mall if i just knew her name i could find her house in the phone book people used the phone book to do exactly that or in some cases to stalk exes who moved to new locations or other less noble causes this is not really something up for debate these are all things people actually did just because they could look up peoples addresses in the phone book if they knew their name and yet people just accepted it as a normal part of life
Showerthoughts,removed,you mean like women not being comfortable by being approached by overly aggreesive men they arent attracted to i get wherr you are coming from but thats hardly a reason to hate an entire demographic being uncomfortable with being hit on by another man is totally different then hating them and thinking we should make any homoerotic act illegal and lynch all the gay people

Showerthoughts,removed,no its the fact that knowing gay people exist that bothers us letting someone know theyre gay immediately invites the unwanted thought of sexual intercourse with another man which of course is repulsive honestly its like if you see a pregnant woman dont tell me the first thing you dont think about is her fucking another dude and letting him squirt his seed into her vagina its the same fucking principle thats why were so bothered at the mention of someone being gay at any other time all were thinking about is either of food or breasts dont disrupt that

Showerthoughts,removed,im not dodging your questions when somebody collapses next to you it can be for an endless number of reasons if it is related to the heart that narrows it down but it still leaves a vast number of potential issues related strictly to the heart if you do not feel a pulse cpr should be started immediately if you conveniently had an aed right next to you you would likely start by attempting to place the aed the aed then needs to charge and determine if there is a shockable rhythm if this process takes any longer than seconds compressions take priority even if it means interrupting the aed you do a round of compressions and allow the aed to then attempt to interpret the rhythm again defibrillation from the aed is not foolproof and is not effective at all if the persons heart has no electrical activity ie asystole it will not shock a person if the shock wont accomplish anything cpr pumps blood it pumps blood regardless of the underlying rhythm of the heart yes an aed is a crucial step in a resuscitation but only if it is indicated without a pulse cpr is always indicated you could potentially save someones life by only using an aed but the likelihood is low more likely that person will need a slew of medications intubation etc even if the aed accomplished its task cpr buys more time for these things in the event that the person remains pulseless or that the aed was unsuccessful the final answer is you would not pick one over the other you would place the aed and start compressions while the aed charges the answer is both because the aed while crucial does not replace the pumping action of cpr

Showerthoughts,removed,story time went to work on the inside of a money truck facility where they count and store the money for customers that place was full of millions of dollars blocks of silver and even a bag of diamonds we walked into this place via one security guys at a overhead door didnt ask for names id or anything said we were there for the construction project going on this place was shitty warehouse very under funded it had two rooms acting a vaults with the doors propped open with pallets of silver blocks to get my materials in for the job i had to move a bin on wheels full of uncounted dollar bills there was plastic bags with up to written on them just in the hall way on the floor this place was the most unprofessional place i have ever seen i have been to food packing places with more security than this in fact i accidentally walked into a room with loose diamonds in a plastic bag because the guard was on his phone and i simply walked past him perched on a stool i stopped when i realized i was in the wrong place and asked him for directions he seemed confused on how i walked right by him this place gave me anxiety i actually had to call my wife and enplane how crazy it was that there was all this money being counted and sorted with very limited security i went there about three or four times and they just started recognizing my work shirt and face i talked to one of the guards he said he only makes an hour and he didnt give a shit about the money he would rather just live and he felt very unsafe there due to how relaxed it was i am sure that a huge hit on this place could have easily taken place it was very close to a freeway and had very limited armed guards maybe only or with only pistols yet those guys would do nothing to stop it the place was about as big as an auto garage with not heavy fortified doors when i tell people about my experience they cant even believe how shitty this place was im assuming that is why we were doing new construction but i cant express how vulnerable that building was at this time i was literally moving bags of money out of my way picking them up setting them to the side even kicking with my feet just to move carts of out materials in they were strict on taking photos most likely due to them not wanting people to see how fucking shitty the building was and how careless the money was just laying around

Showerthoughts,removed,nah i just felt like talking some shit because youre a judgmental cunt and probably wouldnt get invited to the bar even if you did drink but then again since you apparently have anger issues and cant learn to keep yourself under control maybe its best for you to just stay inside and not bother anyone anyway im done here tah
Showerthoughts,removed,if he can screw a seal he can worship a llama itsallim sayin actually no im not endorsing this shit

Showerthoughts,removed,youre an idiot
Showerthoughts,removed,how does being any of those things make you a tard fuck you pal
Showerthoughts,removed,sure here you gopardon the snarkiness but the guy i replied to on this was being a dick so he had it coming note this is just one example there are several other verses you can reference as well that makes it pretty clear that the word was correctly translated as virgin note i dont believe any of the bible and ill be the first to acknowledge theyve messed with it to serve their own ends but if youre going to critique it there are a ton of valid examples where you can pick it apart theres no need to make up shit like this
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont think that jives you are correct that the hebrew word transliterated almah used in isaiah could be used to mean young woman however the greek word used in the new testament during the account uses the word transliterated parthenos which is pretty unambiguously virgin in the septuagint a translation of the hebrew into greek that predates the new testament parthenos was again the word that was chosen to translate the passage in isaiah in the context of isaiah it would make no sense whatsoever for almah to mean young womannubile the sign to be asked for was to be as high as heaven or as deep as sheol and a young woman getting pregnant certainly doesnt fit that description
Showerthoughts,removed,actually hes famous for knocking out that cunt
Showerthoughts,removed,it wasnt originally written in greek it was written in hebrew meaning it was translated thus allowing for mistranslation man you are fulla shit the new testament was written in greek had you the wherewithal to even read the first paragraph on httpsenwikipediaorgwikinewtestament you would have realized that and not made a complete ass out of yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,lol so many things wrong i dont even know where to begin first off a iivv or iivv progression would make a pretty weird sounding song as it never resolves from the dominant back to the tonic kind of important you were probably thinking of the iivvi motion in the bar blues progression heres the thing the tonic subdominant dominant tonic motion is one of the most common things youll see in western music and is in no way exclusive to blues heck the resolution of a dominant chord back down to the tonic vi or as it is more commonly know the authentic cadence is literally the foundation of western harmony except jazz ironically if your playing three chord songs probably around of what youre playing is going to be iivvi just like the blues you shit on infact what youre playing is probably just whitewashed blues the rest will probably be a mix of ivivi or iivi which comes from jazz the genre you apparently hate all will have the vi resolution have you ever actually bothered to analyze the music you play do you even have the ability to analyze the music youre playing why dont you post the chords to some of your songs and lets see how different your stuff is i feel i should add that its painfully obvious youve never studied music at the professional level anyone whos taken even a semester of college level theory can see how full of shit your comment is im not sure who you thought you were going to fool btw i dont need to play gigs to make money i have an actual job with a salary benefits etc i know how much musicians actually make or should i say dont make which is why i switched majors enjoy taking the bus to the bank i bet those insufficient fund fees are a bitch i wouldnt know lol
Showerthoughts,removed,just so u all know this is one of the most reposted shower thought in the history of reddit and op is just a karma whore with lots of time to spare
Showerthoughts,removed,could you be anymore dumb just because it resolves back to the tonic doesnt make it an extra chord its still the same three chords played in a different order chords is chords you realize in a chord progression the order is just as important as what chords youre playing thats why they call it a chord progression i dont play here unless i get paid or more for a piece band which i have a wednesday thursday saturday and sunday residency all four a different major casino really because according to your bands facebook page you only have gigs for the entire month of june two of which are at pizza rock in fact it looks like pretty much every gig you guys have after june takes place at pizza rock forgive me its been a while since ive been to vegas is pizza rock now a major casino not too mention i eat for free and drink for free every time all the shitty pizza and mountain dew you can drink lol i played jazz for years in of one the best schools for it playing in your highschools jazz band isnt playing jazz for years in one of the best schools for it can you even call playing guitar work not the way you play holes and hearts lol howd you come up with that name shittygenericbandnamegeneratorcom you know the reason nobody left any comments on your rate my music submission because you guys are godawful btw even if you did split a night between a four piece four days a week every week for a year it would only net you a year way less than most dentists math must not be your strong suit i see why you never went to college on a side note even in your fantasy i still make more money than you lol

Showerthoughts,removed,i get what youre saying but different people have different learning styles some dont get much from lectures or can learn the material in other ways if someone can miss two classes without it affecting their grade that doesnt necessarily reflect poorly on the teacher could just be that the student has another way that works better for them i had a formal logic course with an excellent textbook and homework software and i probably only attended about half of the lectures because i genuinely didnt need to that didnt work for everyone though and many needed the lectures to understand the material because thats just how they learn that wasnt bad on the professor that was good because he was effectively teaching students with diverse learning styles

Showerthoughts,removed,took a test sample from today forgot phone drew dickbutt with upvote arrow awaiting replies
Showerthoughts,removed,it was a british colony but they are not british they are americans youre not automatically the citizen of a country just because its military occupies its land or were all the native americans suddenly fucking british
Showerthoughts,removed,no you can kill yourself in a field or the ocean
Showerthoughts,removed,well lets take a look at your activity for the day ill just quote from your overview page go suck a dick with that cheap trolling bro youre just talking out of your ass i doubt anything you said was actually true go fuck yourself troll much do us a favorsave the planet you should not procreate but seeing that most of your post are about gaming i would assume that the likely hood of you finding a woman willing from your moms basement is nil now go cry to your girlfriend on wow
Showerthoughts,removed,bbbbbut they are putting their lives on the line and its scary and hard being a cop when everyone is scared of you for killing people so of course they have to kill anyone they start feeling afraid about
Showerthoughts,removed,dont forget to kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,👍
Showerthoughts,removed,theres always a chance they could be born with below average intelligence mental retardation or absolutely anything
Showerthoughts,removed,so the colonist from france suddenly became british as did those from germany and spain china as well mind all british and apparently everyone was part of the military and native americans dont count so according to your version of world history all the people conquered around the world by the british became british and even more remarkably stopped being british when colonial rule ended so at one point the nation of india no longer had any indians left they were all british then overnight they became indian again everyone in poland became russian during the days of the ussr i dont fucking think so
Showerthoughts,removed,the most you can do is kill yourself that is no kids
Showerthoughts,removed,sketchy shit happened so its ok if everyone gets a gun in their face the fuck is wrong with you

Showerthoughts,removed,also kill yourself not saying you should but if you want to dramatically reduce your impact on the environment death will reduce that carbon footprint
Showerthoughts,removed,or you can just kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,well along those lines the most environmentally friendly thing you can do then is to kill yourself and not have any children

Showerthoughts,removed,go home for peace if you walk on to the shared space expecting respect from everyone to everyone not happening you expect peace and quiet you might get lucky here and there or it might just be that its pretty tolerable save for a few louder people but if you walk on not expecting to receive any of that you probably wont leave as disappointed as you would if you did think you would get that kind of treatment
Showerthoughts,removed,just because you do doesnt mean it gets reciprocated to you i know its what many people would like but come on we all know public transit isnt always fun or pleasant but you can think of others like well theyre just trying to get home too maybe they had a super bad day maybe they got fired and maybe i just wont freak the fuck out if i cant have our public transit my way if its that bad to some of you out there on busses and trains then i see why you get stabby you should avoid shared space situations until you are more realistic

Showerthoughts,removed,the older generations of the bourgeoisie have nothing to offer the younger ones because they have nothing in the first place all their standards are hollow all of their riches are consolation prizes not one of their values contains any reference to real joy or fulfillment their children sense this and rebel accordingly whenever they can get away with it the ones that dont have already been beaten into terrified submission so how has bourgeois society continued to perpetuate itself through so many generations by absorbing this rebellion as a part of the natural life cycle because every child rebels as soon as she is old enough to have a sense of self at all this rebellion is presented as an integral part of adolescence—and thus the woman who wants to continue her rebellion into adulthood is made to feel that she is insisting on remaining a child forever its worth pointing out that a brief survey of other cultures and peoples will reveal that this adolescent rebellion is not inevitable or natural this perpetual rebellion of the youth also creates deep gulfs between different generations of the bourgeoisie which play a crucial role in maintaining the existence of the bourgeoisie as such because the adults always seem to be the enforcers of the status quo and the youth do not have the perspective yet to see that their rebellion has also been absorbed into that status quo generation after generation of young people are able to make the mistake of identifying older people themselves as the source of their misfortunes rather than realizing that these misfortunes are the result of a larger system of misery they grow older and become bourgeois adults themselves unable to recognize that they are merely replacing their former enemies and still unable to bridge the socalled generation gap to learn from people of other age groups let alone establish some kind of unified resistance with them thus the different generations of the bourgeoisie while seemingly fighting amongst themselves work together harmoniously as components of the larger social machine to ensure maximum alienation for all

Showerthoughts,removed,yeah i do
Showerthoughts,removed,this isnt a shower thought and yes it is an invitation if you are one of those annoying drivers who leaves a silly amount of space in front of you then yes people would and should take it esp during rush hour traffic you are driving like a self righteous moron
Showerthoughts,removed,people are starting to think you really suck youre wrong your showerthought made it way too high up there and you should feel bad for not changing your opinion with a knowledgable comment someone had to say it
Showerthoughts,removed,no you arent youre impeding traffic if youre going slower than everyone else on the road leaving a gap does not necessitate going slowly i can leave a car gap in front of me and still be going the exact same speed as everyone else the point of the gap is that when all the tailgating idiots in front of me start hitting the brakes because someone slowed down slightly i wont have to and neither will anyone behind me well just keep cruising along like nothing happened and there will be no jam for us
Showerthoughts,removed,sadly its people like you shut the fuck up thats a huge assumption to make youre an idiot for jumping to conclusions about my driving ability and taking it so personally you need to launch into personal attacks your argument is so nonsensical and weak and emotional hence why youre shit talking and telling everyone else to relax if you are not keeping up with the flow of traffic you are slowing down you can engage in a semantics debate and pretend that kind of slowing down doesnt count for whatever dumb reason youre trying to promote but it wont change reality
Showerthoughts,removed,youre a snarky little bitch arent you
Showerthoughts,removed,unless you kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,maybe if you shut the fuck up about it it might go away you whiny ass bitches

Showerthoughts,removed,because youre so insecure in your belief of an allpowerful allknowing god that you need make sure he knows you know he knows whats best first four words are more than enough to describe it people are afraid and insecure about their decisions and the responsibility they have of leading their own life that they turn to something to provide comfort and answers whether those answers are conclusive or not isnt really that relevant but it is an easy ideal to cling too i first realized this when i had my first existential crisis which i still think about now and then and was totally overwhelmed by the concept of nonexistence i pretty quickly realized why people might want to take the easy route and turn to something like religion which has promises of an afterlife
Showerthoughts,removed,funny but hey i wish i could eat organic whats wrong with not wanting to eat a bunch of gylcophosphate and other crap really not a fan of organic shaming as someone that spends a lot of time on an organic farm

Showerthoughts,removed,one time i had weeks and ounces of weed with which to housesit my two dogs nothing but smoke making music and playing with dogs
Showerthoughts,removed,dont worry guys im a guy but lots of us are pieces of shit who shouldnt be in charge of looking after any living things
Showerthoughts,removed,look in society and think of men you know and i doubt you would ever trust many of them to do a good job at carrying a baby you need a softpolite womans touch and men are more aggressive and rude it is just a fact now throw in all the extra dumb shit guys do and i think you will begin to see why it wouldnt work bar fights while pregnant etc percentage wise it would be way worse
Showerthoughts,removed,actually i hate on certain women too but there is no doubt that they are better caretakers in general it is a fact if you really think the world would be better off with men being pregnant then you dont live in reality
Showerthoughts,removed,nah youre just projecting you being human trash and me and you sharing a single genetic trait does not equate us just because that one psycho chick murdered her baby doesnt mean all women would do that
Showerthoughts,removed,my best friend is a lesbo a better bro than the guys in my life

Showerthoughts,removed,its actually the real you the you at the core saying hey stupid dont kill yourself over that breakup or cause youre broke and depressed those are just ephermal problems and your life is more meaningful than that oh that got deep really fast
Showerthoughts,removed,being mentally ill enough to want to kill yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,i disagree i dont think theres necessarily anything wrong with you mentally if you want to kill yourself there could be but its not a prerequisite
Showerthoughts,removed,god damn it its not that hard just whip it out
Showerthoughts,removed,ignorant i have first hand knowledge of it my father was a good person he gave his other kids a good life but for him out of site was out of mind and its like that for guys every where look up any thread on reddit were people talk about men being able to sign away their parental right as long as they dont have to pay for their kids as well they are all for it know what you are talking about you dumb fuck
Showerthoughts,removed,hey i wouldnt worry too much about what you did you were trying to help the poor thing if you let a dogs hair get too ratty it can actually hurt it a hell a lot more than a bad scissor job fuck your friend and their poor responsibility i would have been tempted to dognap the pup and get it groomed myself if i had the proper funds and opportunity you might have made it look silly but the dog wont know that only that it feels a hell of a lot better im sure
Showerthoughts,removed,if you are really trying to kill yourself a shotgun is a no brainer
Showerthoughts,removed,the cause of alzheimers would be unknown and your system would categorize the symptoms as problems of mind today we understand the physical causes so you categorize it as a problem of body and accept that it is uncurable and you know for certain the arc of future medical development

Showerthoughts,removed,shotguns dont need special training are common or you can make one from essentially pipes from home depot ammo is common too bonus there also rated as most painless and quick out of common ways of suicide wait did i just give suicide advice
Showerthoughts,removed,they say its selfish to kill yourself because everyone left would miss you so seeing it from the other side and someone saying its selfish to want to keep someone miserable around is interesting a lot of the time i hear about people that are going to off themselves saying they are a burden on the family and people might finally help and understand if they take themselves out of the equation much of the time i think subside is a case of the group survival instinct being stronger than the self preservation one if someone feels they are the element that destroys the group or tribeif its early humans they will try to eliminate themselves to save the others a group of hunters in the jungle are attacked by a big cat the one with the injured foot lets the big cat get them so everyone else can get away problem is now things get a bit skewed the guy that lost his job and cant get another one feels his family would be better without him as he sees himself as a dead weight the kid being bullied sees themselves as worthless and thinks their family and friends and the world in general would be better off without them the woman with a terminal illness that offs themselves before it gets too bad to save their relatives from witnessing a slow and horrific death and my personal issues im trying to fight im disabled and have family that dont recognise my disabilities criticism and being asked to do something i will fail at all the time is making my disability more obvious to me theres rules to being normal and i cant follow them all so i feel like im being a burden to others if i ask for accommodations for the disability so im a dead weight and the family would do so much better without needing to worry about me its hard to find anywhere that someone can talk about stuff like this without running into people treating wanting to off yourself as the symptom and the problem at the same time everyone ignores other issues that leads to that mindset if people stopped making such a big think of the wanting to off yourself and looked more into the why then i think a lot more solutions would be found and more causes treated and for those people that really are sick with no outside cause it would get them on the right meds much sooner
Showerthoughts,removed,you sound very suicidal yourself go ahead im not stopping you

Showerthoughts,removed,wrong taxation is paying towards the cost of running your government
Showerthoughts,removed,that seems like a logically consistent framework but there are also a number of other frameworks some of which view committing suicide as okay regardless of soundness of mindbody plus what if youre sound of mind and body and want to kill yourself what if youre unsound of mind and body plus sound is just too general then again it is definitely one of the existing modes of thought on the matter

Showerthoughts,removed,fcc complaint we cant do anything quickly became heres you refund you have to understand that just because something worked for you that it might not work for others its crazy to see people on reddit do not actually get that simple minded concept a csr gets less of a headache and a closed ticket for lying about being unable todo anything and then gets written up suspended or even terminated i would hope that you could understand that people wouldnt risk their job just to make one their job slightly easier and faster not to mention in a call center someone else will have to deal with your lie at another time and probably would report you to the supervisors especially if the customer is required to go to management to fix the issue dont be so full of yourself
Showerthoughts,removed,straight from a debate with some middle class guy in virginia in my inbox i kid you not youre simply not worth it just like how youre not worth my added healthcare expense to insure nb i actually have paid in the full cost of insurance my whole adult life i have no sob story myself i still dont see why you seem to think that i should go to work to earn money for somebody else thats not why i work i work to get money that i can spend not so that i can spend it on someone else however i have no use for ops remission it doesnt serve me any purpose so no im not interested in paying for it umatchboxx this is the sort of human being we are dealing with in the united states

Showerthoughts,removed,because until very recently a majority of the us specifically didnt want same gender couples to exist at all marriage is a legal and social institution celebrating and reinforcing socially approved monogamous sexual relationships as being both valid and binding one hand it provides legal and social resources meant to help keep them together and on the other hand it makes sex with anyone else a crime adultery and makes ending the relationship legally difficult and until recently sex without marriage has been socially condemned and often illegal for a man to have sex with a woman who was not his wife was seen as irresponsible and callous it could seriously fuck up her life and if she got pregnant it definitely would since most people arent inclined towards perpetual celibacy heterosexual men were encouraged to marry as a way of directing their desire for sexual relationships into a socially approved and theoretically exclusive and permanent union with his wife premarital sex is more acceptable now but old traditions die hard all of this was irrelevant to same gender couples until relatively recently because they were generally considered to be by definition not socially approved relationships until a number of us states still treated them as literally criminal and without fear of illegitimate pregnancy for a long time most gay people didnt see much reason to marry either it wasnt until the aids crisis that legal marriage started to become a major fight as young couples suddenly realized that without legal marriage they didnt have legal family rights to their dying partners it wasnt until that of the us started supporting legal marriage equality for same gender couples and were still at only about and a lot of that support is coming from people for whom marriage is not seen as particularly necessary though there are some exceptions to the rule social structures that still actively encourage marriage tend to be religious in nature and the episcopal church formally extended the sacrament of marriage to same gender couples in many dioceses are very actively encouraging same gender couples to seek marriage blessings because they dont want anyone to avoid them in the mistaken impression that they arent welcome

Showerthoughts,removed,i mean we have a professional sports team called the redskins
Showerthoughts,removed,i had an easy time in school but i also was a terrible student i was really good at retaining information but wasnt the greatest at things like math and what not took speech therapy until the second grade i found out last fall when i started looking into some health things for epilepsy related things that the schools thought i had a spectrum autism disorder but my parents had never done any tests or anything but looking back i do definitely feel that there were some developmental deficiency that got overlooked all in all school itself wasnt bad but i didnt enjoy it but i never had a reason not too enjoy it i had friends and all that and while i didnt always pick up on social cues i was generally okay there was some embarrassing moments in middle school while i was kind of coming into my sense of humor but by high school i dont think i ever really had any sort of problems i have always had an issue being interested in things though when i went to uni i majored in anthropology because history has always been super interesting to me especially anything pertaining to primitive peoples religious studies entheogenic use so on so forth in school i did well in the typical social studieshistorygeography tract and enjoyed english enough but had trouble with math and didnt much enjoy biologyphysics etc i stopped doing homework in the fifth grade and still managed to graduate but in my teen years around started feeling really listless and out of place when i was in twelfth grade i literally just drove around during my open class blocks i didnt have a bad life or anything i just wanted something different and that feeling has lingered and been a definitely hindering element for my adult life now only mind you after graduating i realized i hadnt planned on what to do afterwards and really only went to university so i didnt just stay in my lil town working after finishing university i was just back in the same place of not really knowing what to do ive spent the last two years more or less looking for work and never really finding something that is satisfying i work i come home kind of just lay on the floor for an hour staring at the ceiling that sort of thing existential dread i guess i have a lot of trouble fathoming how people just live life because i feel like ive felt a bit out of it for most of my developmental years and what originally started as just a general listlessness and lack of direction has now resulted in a complete inability to really make moves in any healthy direction at all im just kind of meh about life ive come to realize though that when im stressed i easily get overwhelmed and just kind of shut down coupled with an ability to really hyperfocus on useless things while being unable to put any effort into something useful like just walking up town and finding a job and i think its because ive been unhappy for so long that i dont really see myself moving forward by doing these things the goal post keeps shifting after every milestone that were told we should hit theres also just some difficulties with my parents making me feel kind of guilty about liking the things i do such as travelling and what not because theyre worried im going to go some place far away and they wont get to see me and such but its resulted in me feeling like i just act like plastic when im around them and stuffing my real humorous excitable personality down inside me instead of being genuine about how i feel and see my world and myself lest i offend them or something just stuff like that so yea long post sorry keep in mind i entered school a year late so i was one of the older kids but again my parents said they didnt send me to kindergarten the year they should have because i didnt want to go ive always been kind of a shutin type keep to myself i liked university for having an active community around me while being able to also have my own space but growing up i made little efforts to be with friends outside of school because i preferred my space and that same reason is why they withheld putting me in kindergarten but school wasnt hard i didnt enjoy it either though i just had trouble garnering interest and putting value in things i think didnt know how to set goals and work towards them just did kind of the bare minimum that was required and kind of proved to myself that the system is kind of flawed if you can put in a terrible lack of effort and still graduate when you were supposed to i regret not challenging myself when i was younger

Showerthoughts,removed,dont know anything about the rights of succession or reasons why several royal families are kept as figureheads youre talking out of your ass here and think the kardashians are somehow comparable youre a weird racist with anger issues youre now lying on top of all this keep it classy kid im sorry if pointing out where youre being dumb with this upset you so much but go see a psychiatrist man for everyones sake

Showerthoughts,removed,the religions are actually very similar islam believes in jesus they believe that jesus was sent by god and believe in virgin mary they just dont believe he is the son of god islam is actually much more like christianity than judaism when it comes to jesus they also feel that splitting god into the holy trinity is wrong that god should be left as one complete being thats pretty much the main difference there are some other cultural differences like dresscodes etc but the actual belief system is very similar and all the key players are there so its probably the same god its not like other religions where they were formed very separately and had their own separate idea of god the difference between chritianity and islam is more about differences in interpretation
Showerthoughts,removed,fascist
Showerthoughts,removed,there are parts of the bible that predict the coming of a prophet some people argue that this is muhammad and some people argue its not i removed the sentance because i dont want people to just dismiss everything i said based on that minor point
Showerthoughts,removed,therefore we are not only speculating we are making statements that have basis in hard science and in extremely advanced mathematics our statements about the universe are not simply educated guesses they are much more than that you say we and our like youre some sort of esteemed scientist who has done all of the calculations himself while having tea with steven hawking in reality you only post to ask about pre pubescent boys and their ability to get erections what is that about what were you gonna do with that information i dont really care to hear what you believe please dont diddle any more kids

Showerthoughts,removed,i was fkying around yesterday when the sub attkd my ship and left me sranded in space for a few hours
Showerthoughts,removed,i dont like either of them very much and i guess maybe its because theyre basically the exact same they play the same character in every movie with a fantastic supporting cast acting as a crutch to hold them up their early stuff was good because the roles they played were fresh but watching adam sandler play some guy who floats around the line for mental retardation or seth rogan play a lazy stoner gets old after a while its also pretty funny that i consider rogans role as a hot dog in sausage party to be his best one yet probably because it wasnt his typical stoner role id like to see them both step out of the box a little more because they definitely have the potential to be more than type casted lead roles in every movie they make

Showerthoughts,removed,everyone has their own set of standards for some people being fat does not fit those standards and therefore would make sex not enjoyable and in this particular case his standards are no fat chicks and that standard isnt based in an abstract moral principle its based solely in carnal desires youre still skating around the issue like a little bitch you femnazis need to stop taking everyones statements out of context just to devalues everyone elses opinion hahahahahaha youre the one bitching here did i offend you again youre the bitch in all of this

Showerthoughts,removed,yep
Showerthoughts,removed,i guess if you raised rats like we do chickens and rat meat were particularly tasty due to what we fed them and how we prepared the meat then i suppose it is possible i doubt it would be economical enough to do on an industrial scale though particularly since rats are aggressive omnivores who will eat their own as opposed to cattle and chickens which are herbivores and relatively docile

Showerthoughts,removed,my parents always taught me to be responsible not just with finances how ever limited they may be at the moment but with everything in my life parents can be great teachers but without experiencing first hand what happened when i was so ridiculously irresponsible with my money i wouldnt have truly understand the importance of what they were getting at of course there are many other reasons why i ended up homeless but blowing every last dollar i earned kept me there much longer than i would have liked that and crippling drug addiction lol anyway it taught me a lot i am able to live comfortably now even on the smallish income i have the way i look at it is that i have heat the lights turn on when i flip the switch theres food in the fridge and a stove to cook on and i even have a little bit left over to treat myself now and then that is so much better then having to decide where to sleep on any given night and not knowing when ill have any food besides the dinner the local shelter serves its very easy to complain about being poor and broke when youre not sure if youll have to walk to work this week because you might not have enough for gas or maybe you cant buy those new shoes youve been thinking about getting i try to look at it from the other side i have a bed to sleep on i have a job etc it may not be much of a life going to work just to pay the bills but thats why i aspire to better myself i want the vacations and the new car and my own house i definitely got a late start on life due to all the years of drug use but after only two years of staying clean and a lot of discipline i feel im going to be alright

Showerthoughts,removed,the problem with blind surveys is that we have no way to verify their accuracy some women have faked sexual harassment in order to promote the feminist cause and then sometimes the reason for lying about rape or maybe misunderstanding what rape means is muddled for example ive read women online who say that it is rape if the man promises a relationship but then reneges after sex in canada we recently had a trial for one of our media personalities named ghomeshi and during the trial it was revealed that multiple accusers had contact with the man after the alleged incident and even sent him provocative bikini pictures and emails pleading to see him again he was acquitted

Showerthoughts,removed,then let me clarify you came in here correcting me when youre actually wrong its annoying as fuck when people correct others because the person piping up with their supposed correction cant comprehend two whole sentences moreover your anecdotal evidence for why i was incorrect was equally idiotic the fact that you have seen the very thing we are talking about does not mean i am wrong i never said they dont exist i pointed out that they are not provided by oems i did however point out that the reason people like you see flashing brake lights is because dealerships and individual car owners will install aftermarket flashers this would support the very anecdotal observations youre claiming to be evidence for the idea that i am incorrect now that ive taken the time to spell it out for you i hope youll appreciate why you were in fact the asshole and your assholiness is more than likely a byproduct of a reading comprehension failure or very poor logic

Showerthoughts,removed,throughout history poverty is the normal condition of man advances which permit this norm to be exceeded — here and there now and then — are the work of an extremely small minority frequently despised often condemned and almost always opposed by all rightthinking people whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating or as sometimes happens is driven out of a society the people then slip back into abject poverty this is known as bad luck ― robert a heinlein so no its not privilege not a random thing to happen to some people for no reason at all its a result of ingenuity hard work and sacrifice of those who built this particular civilization others would do well to learn from them instead of sitting on their asses full of envy and complaining

Showerthoughts,removed,absolutely to begin nestle believes that humans do not have a right to water recently nestle took a small water supply in ontario and shortly before that michigan heres an article from last year about how nestle takes millions of gallons of water from california and sells it back to them at prices that well exceed gasoline they pay about bucks to do this heres a humanitarian docket on nestles program to drain pakistan who amazingly has almost no restrictions on its water sources but thats all just outside sources pointing at the first world examples well besides pakistan how does most of the third world fare in terms of protests and reporting no one cares except the dying and that problem resolves itself nestle just posts about it on their website why bat an eye at a legal deal nestle strikes to purchase a water source they pointed at a product they paid the town a lot of money some of that money might possibly make it into the community maybe and now they own it of course now the people dont their option for water is now purchase it in the third world exactly where does logic take you etheopia for example httpwwwnestlecommedianewsnestlewatersethiopiawaterbrandabyssiniasprings this is just water theres plenty more reason to get upset about the fact that they are too big to boycott

Showerthoughts,removed,if using that statement is so bad that people should be fired for it why is it in the language because ancient c code might use it and you cant pull features out of a compiler that breaks working code its in c because c is compatible with c code except for edge cases like the keyword class and c is supposed to be mostly copy and compile compatible with c inside of execution blocks if you choose a language where the statement is needed then why make a hard rule to never never ever ever use it just because the language technically allows you to do something doesnt mean you should ever do it if someone wrote a program with identifiers that looked like this theyd deserve to be shot public class public public public oooo return just because you can do something doesnt mean its ever a good idea their clear and concise way of using goto can be implemented more readably and in the same number of lines using system public class nestedloopexitwithoutgoto public static void main int x y int count string myarray new string initialize the array for int i i x i for int j j y j myarray counttostring read input consolewriteenter the number to search for input a string string mynumber consolereadline if containsmynumbermynumber myarray x y consolewritelinethe number is found mynumber else consolewritelinethe number was not found mynumber consolewritelineend of search public static bool containsmynumberint mynumber string myarray int x int y for int i i x i for int j j y j if myarrayequalsmynumber return true return false but you are correct that if someone said look this is absolutely the best way to write this its in a better big o category from nongoto implementations and its clear and concise then fine they can use it but i have never seen anyone use a goto statement in a algorithm of significant complexity without turning the entire thing into a godforsaken mess of tangled shitcovered spaghetti

Showerthoughts,removed,two words slacker radio it is the best music streaming service one of the first offers the most customization in the content and behavior of your stations and has the most accurate music mapsimilarity algorithm this is my opinion of slacker radio in comparison to every other music streaming service ive used and im someone who used to host winamp live dj streams so pretty much every service since the internet was born hands down the best thing for me about it is the more you listen to a station the more personalized to your tastes it gets i know they all have favorites etc but im talking about in the behavior of the stations mainly in the new artistsong algorithm ive been using it for over a decade now my first custom station hasnt played something i banned or skipped in months though it still regularly adds new songs for the past year or so ive been listening to their favorites radio feature which is a station based on everything youve ever favored on any station its incredible i listen pretty much whenever im not sleeping seriously slacker radio make an account and start playing with making your own custom station you wont regret it

Showerthoughts,removed,in the otherwise awful episode code of honor data pointed out that french was a rather obscure language this has been taken by fans to mean that french was not a common tongue we have examples of picard actually speaking french and it was left untranslated this suggests he wasnt speaking french he likely just learned english from an englishman

Showerthoughts,removed,i cant figure out if youre being serious or not you think youre actually fighting the system no youre just stiffing a guy from a tip and literally nothing changes or do you honestly believe anywhere near enough people will suddenly spring up across the country by total coincidence in order to make any sort of difference you must not tip forcing the employer to always makeup the difference or just dont be a dickwad and actually tip which will bring the total amount to the same amount youd be paying anyway after they increase the cost of the food to make up the difference of having to pay their employees more

Showerthoughts,removed,but that is no justification were supposed to believe that this deity made us the way that we are and then he rewards his creation with genocide for being the way he made us we could go more indepth and argue over whether or not the creation was what he created based on the story of the tree of knowledge but it comes back the same adam and eve did not know wrong from right so to tell them to not eat from a certain tree would be meaningless to them until after they had eaten from said tree

Showerthoughts,removed,it sucks but i just remind myself that im being a fat slob sitting on my couch while someone literally brings hotcookeddelicious food to my doorstep when you really stop to think about it how much of a damn luxury is delivery food there is a company in my city that has drivers work through an app like uber so they leave their home drive to the restaurant where the food is no limits anywhere in town get the foodcheck the food drive to the customers home and deliver it to them the fee for the consumer no matter how much food is flat fee this flat fee is used to pay the drivers paycheck because lets face it how the hell else is the company making money besides maybe a tiiiiiny cut from the restaurants but lets also face it because it takes about that long when all is said an done for a driver isnt too great so the driver relies on a tip basically if you dont want to tip you have to anticipate that the delivery fee is going to go up because aint nobody going to do the job for and the company has to collect the money to pay the drivers somehow

Showerthoughts,removed,i have many posts with many downvotes but a fewposts with crazy upvotes im an asshole who got lucky i guess
Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,i love it when people on the internet try to guilttrip me whenever this subject comes up youre being unfair to people who are creating content by denying them ad revenue but as soon as anyone starts talking about cronyism workers rights or money in politics they get labeled as a filthy socialist

Showerthoughts,removed,the ability to hide all documentaries that have to do with as a something individual i have see it all and know entirely too much much about
Showerthoughts,removed,like anyone gives a shit about your opinion
Showerthoughts,removed,hmmm kinda sounds like the original cable tv dilemma that brought rise to these services ive been saying it forever we are excited to call ourselves chord cutters for the sake of sticking it to the cable company comcast in my neck of the woods but at the end of the month im paying for netflix for hulu for hbo now and for nhltv and i need an isp for good service so i still have to pay about for that so im paying for internet and entertainment which is basically what youre paying for cable with lots more channels that you probably wont want anyway
Showerthoughts,removed,thats actually not the point though that is what ends up happening since people downvote what they dont like andor agree with
Showerthoughts,removed,if you use res you can filter by common words specifically for that sub
Showerthoughts,removed,does anyone really think they could produce enough content to survive without the licensing of other content think back to the dvd days and remember what really made netflix attractive the selection netflix is headed towards an hbo model and even though thats more viable i think itll represent the destruction of netflixs market dominance
Showerthoughts,removed,holy fuck kill yourself please its tutturu or at least tuturu
Showerthoughts,removed,i never understood the netflix hype their backend is very simplistic horrible recommendations and rating system and at least in europe their library is nothing but awful a few crappy sitcoms that run on free tv every day since the last fifteen years some bmovies some netflix productions that are ok but not much more doesnt justify €month imo an adblocker and one of the free streaming sites are way better with basically everything available it seems north americans often like netflix though i wish i knew what they get to see
Showerthoughts,removed,trump would destroy much of what is great about america hillary clinton is the strong leader we need and its important that trump lose by a landslide to reject what he stands for reed hastings netflix ceo and this is why i canceled netflix subscriber since it was just a mail in dvd service im not paying for your political commentary i was paying you for the ease of access to movies and shows that i like
Showerthoughts,removed,except my boss cant change anything only customers aka you can
Showerthoughts,removed,no matter how long i look i always end up watching trailer park boys family guy or american dad being completely honest if it werent for tpb i would have cancelled years ago
Showerthoughts,removed,i think for most of us there wouldnt be much of a selection left to browse through once we got done hiding everything we dont like
Showerthoughts,removed,can everyone upvote this and send it to other to upvote for the love of god
Showerthoughts,removed,netflix dont give a fuck about what you want guys this is a silly statement they exist to provide customers with a desired experience of course they care and a lot at that the big problem has already been mentioned they do not want to show how much content they have available because of several reasons they dont want to get into a amount of content war with other sites for example as in this site offers the amount of movies netflix has quantity sounds better but if it does not have quality is is still a lot of crap but saying that you have lots more shows than netflix hurts their businessmen they also dont want the customer to feel like theyve seen it all by having the option to effectively remove content as in a notinterestedbutton the customer might end up in a situation were they dont feel like they have anything to watch and while that might be true it is not something you want your customers to feel
Showerthoughts,removed,this will always get an upvote
Showerthoughts,removed,a company to pay for the rights and package everything up into what is basically a streaming cable company the way to fix it is to pass a law that a certain time after first release say six months a company cannot restrict the licensing of a show to a particular platform and must sell to everyone who wants it at the same rate but that will never happen because blah blah blah communism
Showerthoughts,removed,if youre nearsighted everything is blurry once its more than a couple feet in front of you blurry looks the same as blurry which looks the same as blurry etc think about it the opposite way eventually tv screens are going to have so many pixels crammed into them that our human eyes cant tell the difference because the human eye has a finite resolution at that point getting a tv with even more pixels is redundant now imagine if your eyes had a much lower resolution to the point where and both look the same to you and that is likely what ffermata was talking about

Showerthoughts,removed,thats so reductive and misleading its effectively nonsense the crisis was complex and multifaceted the government played its part yes and so did poor people but what about mortgage originators incentivized to crank out lowquality mortgages banks creating and relying on increasingly shitty mortgage backed securities other banks creating derivative products based on mbs the rating agencies not doing their jobs and giving shitty instruments aaa ratings real estate appraisers who inflated house values aig issuing insurance policies on an impossible amount of mbs and mbs based securities pretty much every business being overlevered and reliant on credit the shadow banking system etc etc etc

Showerthoughts,removed,thats basically the point them spending that time in waiting is essentially part of that punishment why do you think so many mass shooters shoot themselves after because most people dont want to go through with the waiting and letting someone else kill them many people like the victims care less about the money and more about gaining control of the horrible situation youre looking at it from the way of the criminal not the victims

Showerthoughts,removed,which is why germany is forever a cuckdom im glad austria is fighting back a bit my grandparents are from vienna and we have all went on family holidays to tyrol what always utterly amazed me was how fucking clean everything was it was like they have magic pixies that come out with pixie dust and all the streets are clean the roads are tarmaced like billiard tables they also split pedestriancyclisttraincar absolutely perfectly they even have public toilets every so often on a road and they are always immaculate the houses have mountainbikes like giant and trek just sitting next to the gate nobody steals them the worst crime is dogshit in the road but it is seriously frowned on compared to the shithole in the uk i live in it was like paradise maybe a bit too sterile but hey when all the rapefugees invaded i could only imagine what an utter shock to the austrian psyche this would bring im glad austria is now following hungarys lead but germany is following swedens self destruction i think
Showerthoughts,removed,the ironic thing is that pretty much every time a country has gone on the whole make x great again its been bullshit germany did in the but weimar germany was demonstrably better than both the german empire and nazi germany hell the german economy did significantly worse under the nazis than they did under the weimar government case in point being that the nazis ran on revitalizing agriculture and helping small family farms yet agricultural yields consistently fell under the nazis the only reason the nazis got so far was because the weimar economy was good enough to prop them up as long as it did despite their best efforts to destroy it
Showerthoughts,removed,

Showerthoughts,removed,wannabe linguist here these arent just used for emphasis either what we call httpsenwikipediaorgwikidoublenegative in standard english are known to linguists as httpmicrosyntaxsitesyaleedunegativeconcord its commonly found in a large variety of languages to say i dont have anything in spanish you would say something like no tengo nada with the double negatives no and nada a requirement for grammaticality now you you might be saying great utoferdelachris but thats spanish and whatever other languages but this is english were talking about here and i would say youre right it turns out this negative concord is a feature of a number of english dialects as well in african american vernacular english as well as southern white english if you said something like i aint got anything or i got nothing well people would probably know what you meant but thats mostly because of their exposure to standard english and it just wouldnt sound right in context i aint got nothing is much more preferable in fact to really drive the point home borrowing from the wikipedia example if you wanted to talk about how you have never owed anything to anyone in such a negativeconcord dialect you would instead say i havent never owed nothing to no one notice the nwords havent never nothing and no one all of these are necessary in this type of dialect now people often argue against double negatives claiming they dont make sense or theyre not logical this is only because in standard english we are used to these negative items changing the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaffirmativeandnegative of the sentence in a sequential way i never ate an apple is a negative sentence the entirety of which is negated by that one never you can think of standard english like a serially wired strand of light bulbs if that one at the front goes out negative then the whole strand automatically goes off turning the whole strand off negative but you can think of negativeconcord languages as a parallel wired strand of bulbs if you want the light off you want the sentence negative you have to turn off all the bulbs hence i never ate no apple instead of i never ate an apple with the second youve still got a lightbulb on that an has to become no the wired light bulb strand metaphor breaks down pretty quickly when you consider the phrase i never ate no apple in standard english because it would translate to i ate an apple even thought its a really weird way to say it the issue is that wired lightbulbs dont really work like that its not like if a lightbulb goes out but then you also turn on the one after it in the series the lights go on again anyway the metaphor is a work in progress theres probably a better analogy from computer science with like boolean gates or something but i dont have time to figure that out right now i promise ill work on it anyway the whole point of this is that as soon as you recognize that in these negative concord dialects and languages the negative httpsenwikipediaorgwikipolarityitem affirm each other instead of cancelling each other out it all makes a lot more sense
Showerthoughts,removed,its not possible to be selfreliant wake up from your damned delusions we arent a bunch of tribes the very fact the internet exists should tell you no country is entirely selfcontained anymore to state otherwise is ignorant
Showerthoughts,removed,in a way hitler was bearing that message the germans reached their height by and surpassed britain in terms of its economy but then pulled itself into a world war with france britain russia and later the us they then established the weimar republic which was overthrown by nazis after great depression hit germany hard
Showerthoughts,removed,especially not with the mongorians
Showerthoughts,removed,i think people look back at a self constructed pipe dream of a golden age of history not even a time that they were alive for but instead just a misconception that time period
Showerthoughts,removed,on the peaceful empire of the japanese none the less who only wanted the us out of the way so they could torture and perform experiments on the chinese and korean while raping their population and executing the rest of the world who was racially inferior dont get me wrong i dont like bringing up japans past because they are a proud people who carry the shame of their actions deeply and have none the less revived their country instead of wallowing in self pity to say the us just made bombs for the sake of blowing up innocent people without the context of the atrocities japan was bestowing upon se asia is ridiculous though
Showerthoughts,removed,ive always admired the germans since i learned about all the wars to be involved in so many wars and on the losing side of it to come back every single time like that that happened exactly because germans are pretty great people overall

Showerthoughts,removed,there are exceptions they are very rare but they exist if it wasnt so rare why would it be a news story as i said regression to the mean exists their children will be more like the rest of the group then they are this continues until they are just like the rest of the group iq is not passed down even if iq was passed down then you still have the problem of race being more than iq why do you think why libertarians are white where as of blacks are democrats we have personality traits related to our race as well theyre measuring gsce scores gsces are bias towards women currently i could increase my immigrant results by only having female immigrants take it it is not a good measure of intelligence its also arguing the lynn effect which argues that iq will grow over time consistently but we have seen the lynn effect not show these results in some racial groups which means the article is based on flawed science that assumes sub performing blacks can become as smart as asians if given enough time which is not true if the lynn effect doesnt work infinitely which it does not your third source is a complete fluff piece it claims having a degree proves youre intelligent if i go to womens studies and get my degree then get hired by the university to work there teaching others womens studies that doesnt mean im intelligent it means i found an easy degree and am scamming people with it the same way i got scammed the news piece is also incredibly bias its advocating open borders and making multiple unsourced claims for proimmigration
Showerthoughts,removed,i didnt realize we were trying to solve problems here as that was not the original point you stated that people who are pc or complain about appropriation are to blame for being divisive i presented a simple real life example that exhibited your arguments and asked a simple question related to that example this is a text based conversation and i thought it best to chose an anecdote that was both current and easy to understand i thought you would be interested in an actual conversation but it seems you only wanted people to agree with your assertion it now makes sense why you want everyone to agree with you it now seems like your assertion is more related to a character flaw that everyone must agree with you and when people dont you seem to seriously lose all decorum it would be nice to be wrong though if youd like to start this over and actually respond to my points
Showerthoughts,removed,have to take hold of the polish or italian or british or french way of doing things dont you have to literally take a citizenship test to become an american you have to learn that short history and of course abide by its rules which until recently meant no gays and no fucken damn red commies this isnt anymore where paddy mcginty can step off the boat and hes american you have to literally follow their way of doing things so what is it that sets them apart every excolonial country is full of people from those colonies so you cant pretend britain or france are in some way different italy is itself an amalgamation of cultures who all happen to hate each other so what is it that sets the us apart its meant to inspire patriotic sentiment

Showerthoughts,removed,
Showerthoughts,removed,and thats why you are single and fat
Showerthoughts,removed,utoomanyinlitter is a quite fitting user for this description
Showerthoughts,removed,being fat isnt exactly a choice yes it is in the abstract idea that humans have control easily at their fingertips if they apply themselves so is it a choice or isnt it how is having control an abstract idea you do have control of what you eat so you have control of your weight im very thin and barely active but i also know that if had genes for slower metabolism or something else that predisposes me to obesity i would have a real problem climbing out of it slow metabolism and activity level are only a tiny part of weight gain the vast majority over is bad eating habits yes climbing out of it is difficult i know because ive been there i broke my food addiction and ended my bad eating habits it wasnt easy but nothing worth doing is easy and thats part of it i have many bad personal habits and im usually stuck in a rut so i sympathize with the struggles of those who are overweight so do i i dont because i know what it takes and you know what it was much easier than everyone says lifes hard man just wait until you hit an obstacle that you cant figure out how cross after a few tries thats happened and you know what i do i keep fucking trying if you just give up you never get anywhere having a fatalist attitude like that is a huge problem on another note fat people are everywhere so its nothing new to children to see a large person that doesnt mean its a good thing in fact one of the obstacles i faced with weight loss was how pervasively normal obesity is in society i thought i was a normal weight when i was actually well overweight allowing models to be overweight just helps for example teenage girls realize that you can have health problems such as being overweight and still be beautiful well heres a new thought if you dont put effort into your appearance no one is going to admire it they may not be ugly but i wouldnt say beautiful either average is the word id use considering overweight is average in the us beauty isnt something you have its something assigned to you by others you dont get to decide whether or not youre beautiful you can attempt to be beautiful but in the end its still others that give the label deluding yourself into thinking that you get to decide whether or not youre beautiful regardless of your physical condition or worse that youre entitled to beauty doesnt help anyone it is certainly a shame that is how our society works but not acknowledging and working with what we have is worse what and self esteem is really important for anyone facing a major struggle ive been in therapy i needed it and i know it self esteem helps people climb out of difficult things like chronic obesity no it isnt the lack of it is what gets you to fucking move its not the means to an end it is the end i was depressed in fact i attempted suicide and i recognized that a large part of my depression was my body image i hated what i saw in the mirror so i slaved away to change it i attained selfworth through selfactualization because thats how it works this feelgood attitude bullshit is part of the problem hating yourself is fine its a motivator theres a reason that selfesteem is built into our brain when its low it creates a drive to better yourself it empowers people to realize they have control which is hard for someone who is always feeling down about themselves whenever they are around other people because they know that theyre being judged for the way they look being happy has nothing to do with your level of control and it doesnt help you take control actually doing something and figuring out how to take control is what helps you take control theyre being judged for a reason and its because they let themselves go too far

Showerthoughts,removed,if he doesnt think in terms of consequences youre sure to find out pretty quickly when the trait shows in his character so how about you reserve judgement until it happens instead of writing someone off based on what you think will happen nothing happens when you judge someone correctly based on something asinine like a tattoo you know warren buffet doesnt come round to your mums house and congratulate her on raising such an astute individual women do not throw pussy at you for your tremendous skills in bookcoverjudging nothing happens on the other hand when you end up being wrong when not if youre not god you will be wrong at times you can do harm you can make any situation worse by judging preemptively while the reverse is not true so maybe instead of judging based on appearance you can judge people when they show their character to be shit like for example the kind of person who would assume someone doesnt think in terms of consequences because theres ink under the skin in someones head

Showerthoughts,removed,the gulf of tonkin was a false flag attack that was used by the military industrial complex in order to start a war with the chinese and soviets in vietnam lbj was too focused on passing the civil rights act and before he knew it mcnamara had drawn the country into a full out war in vietnam as a result there was a division in america between those who went to nam to fight the communists and those who refused to go those living in poverty went and fought while the upper middle and upper class refused to go and die because they saw it for what it was the military is a great way to escape poverty in america when you have no other options other than selling drugs or committing crimes in order to survive the problem is that those in power profit tremendously from war while the poor and uneducated go and die for unworthy causes iraq is the current example an unjust war fought just so oil companies can get there hands on the oil resources of the middle east now war in itself is never a good idea but a war where the fight is for resources should include provisions that benefit those going to die and their families we should be honest with what is happening and not hold the belief that somehow wars are fought over religion or ideas of democracy profit drives war and the wars worth fighting are ones that are fought in selfdefense criminals attack people for their money and people have a right to selfdefense but if you attack someone first because you think they may attack you or look at you funny than you are the criminal

Showerthoughts,removed,what
Showerthoughts,removed,i suppose you think that people who are addicted to drugs also have addictive personalities too please at least read into the science when you watch porn dopamine is released in your body which is what makes you feel good however as you repeatedly watch porn you become less excited so less dopamine is released this is part of why people develop very weird tastes i myself started watching terrible stuff stuff that would have disgusted me before to start with you might not be addicted but many people are without realising

Showerthoughts,removed,the world might be easier when youre attractive but its not perfect people will still be rude to you people will still minimize your opinion and be dismissive of you you wont always be the center of attention and sometimes you will even be ignored you cant get everything you want just by batting your eyelashes some things sure but not everything and sometimes people will even be awful to you because of your good looks it can bring its own set of problems on the contrary i know some fairly unattractive people who always seem to get the best of everything simply because their personalities are very big and warm
Showerthoughts,removed,except probably not
Showerthoughts,removed,http that whore wants do fuck for all outdoors go after there

Showerthoughts,removed,this is so true i know some very beautiful people who have crippling anxiety or are just plain introverted and they seem to struggle in social situations the same way average people do meanwhile i know some not so attractive people who have the world handed to them on a platter because they are gregarious gogetter types who are fun to be around and know how to talk to people being attractive definitely helps but i feel like a lot of people on reddit assume if youre beautiful your life is a complete breeze which is just so not the case
Showerthoughts,removed,wow i feel like ive see this before its almost like this was posted weeks ago worded a little differently oh wait fucking faggot
Showerthoughts,removed,i disagree im not a slut and dont fuck anyones boyfriend when i walk into an office for the first time chicks hate me off the bat once they talk to me and drop their guard they are cool its just wrong to dislike someone bc you think they are better looking than you if they fucked your boyfriend than obviously you should have an issue with them and by the way you said your boyfriend it sounds like this is something that happened to you if it makes you feel better it doesnt matter what you look like pretty girls get cheated on too a good majority of the time they dont get cheated on by someone prettier than them its whoever gives the pos cheater the attention that he will go for

Showerthoughts,removed,when we make contact with aliens conspiracy theorists will make a and say extraterrestrials dont exist i am already saying this the ufo sightings and abduction phenomena have more in common with occultism demonic possession and other paranormal phenomena than they do with actual fleshandblood beings and brickandsteel crafts the statistical data which i have extracted and which i have tried to summarize briefly here indicate that flying saucers are not stable machines requiring fuel maintenance and logistical support they are in all probability transmogrifications of energy and do not exist in the same way that this book exists they are not permanent constructions of matter john keel many ufo reports he said seem to pertain more to accounts of poltergeists cases where objects fly around the room and strange sounds are heard and other types of psychic manifestations than to actual solid items of nuts and bolts hardware that is one of the reasons added dr hynek why i cannot accept the obvious explanation of ufos as visitors from outer space j allen hynek interview the unexplained column by allen spraggett november in march navy commander r mclaughlin published an article in true magazine describing how scientists had tracked a silvery saucerlike object travelling at an overhead speed of miles per hour near the white sands missile range in new mexico this was a startling report because no physical object could travel at such speeds without burning up in the atmosphere chuck missler alien encounters the secret behind the ufo phenomenon

Showerthoughts,removed,ja but the nazis actually did a pretty good job of organizing the games and although brazil has the zika virus to contend with the nazis pulled their olympics off quite well despite having to deal with the arguably much more dangerous threat posed by the jewish cancer still i wish the boys in brazil the best of luck
Showerthoughts,removed,i think that the olympics should be called off entirely the set up is severely lacking and the risk of things going wrong is just too great im of the opinion that athletes should drop out for their own safety and am hopeful that countries start withdrawing entirely in the interest of safety im probably the most jingoistic person in the world and though its difficult to say this without being in their positions would opt out if i were them at this point the idea of the olympics is to foster goodwill and unity amongst nations through friendly competition not to create a potential disaster zone and mass disease outbreak this will do the exact opposite and is an immense hazard to the lives of the athletes the spectators the city of rio and the world at large it needs to be called off the only reason its still on track is due to money and thats not an acceptable reason for the risk this presents
Showerthoughts,removed,you can get the for

Showerthoughts,removed,it really isnt a mixed message yes the dangers are of prime importance but its also important to know what to expect and how to be safe about it sometimes people are drugged workout their knowledge and a bit of foreknowledge can help in those cases which would you rather your kid jabbing themselves multiple times with a used needle or knowing to use a new needle and how to use it properly theres far too many kids taking dose after dose of mdma thinking that extra doses are going to help the fact is the second dose has a far weaker effect and more doses have none at all its also worth knowing about the after effects that youll feel extremely depressed for at least two days and not to kill yourself because its just the effect of the drug its also important to give kids a safe person to talk to about it they shouldnt be more afraid of getting in trouble than they are of the drugs themselves

Showerthoughts,removed,toptier shitpost
Showerthoughts,removed,fuck you
Showerthoughts,removed,go fuck yourself you fucking irish wristwatch
Showerthoughts,removed,the more intelligent you ate the more it begins to feel as though you have the ability to read other individuals minds a pretty lass smiles at you she plays with her hair and giggles with her friends you see this and you understand that she wants you so you oblige and you buy her a drink an old man sits on a bench he sighs and glances at his watch you realize its about noon and thus he must be anxiously awaiting for an appointment to arrive its not difficult really just requires a good bit of thinking certainly no superpower but i would like to think it has gotten me some things in life

Showerthoughts,removed,oh man i didnt even think about that you mean to tell me these lifeforms actually operate motorized vehicles at speeds of to mph while holding a portable communications device and updating their facebook status on this device they somehow think theyre capable of adequately monitoring the environment the movement of other vehicles and processing the neurological functions to manage the data manipulation on these handheld devices they have only two arms and a singlecore brain and they still attempt to multitask to this extent they deserve to die in a huge flaming ball of twisted metal they do

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think hollywood is running out of ideas i think they severely limit themselves based on popular public opinion regarding what they think will be a successful program this is why of shows are now a type of reality show is netflix considered hollywood
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this report from nielsen is years old but it illustrates my point pretty well so what if of was only a mild exaggeration viewership popular public opinion

Showerthoughts,not_removed,you hear that nsa were bros now and bros dont sell out other bros secrets
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in my city they usually rent out a small office location near the hospital
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have them in australia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apartment complexes i dated an ambulance driver and most ambulance companies rent out a bedroom apartment crews work shifts like firefighters and stay at the complex and park their ambulance there ambulance crews are paid a shitty wage even though they are all emergency medical technicians emts usually just an hour but they do this in hopes of moving up to become firefighterparamedics sad that mcdonalds workers lacking the same education commitment planning and drive feel a right to an hour these emts understand the low wage and hard work are dues to be paid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have lots where i live i do notice though that where the police station and fire stations are all municipal the ambulances are all hospital or company based we have hospitals plus st john ambulance and md ambulance

Showerthoughts,not_removed,if by voice in their head you mean thoughts yes deaf people have thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,primarily though most completely deaf people think in sign language similar to how an inner voice of a hearing person is experienced in ones own voice a completely deaf person sees or more aptly feels themselves signing in their head as they talk in their heads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was answered in depth previously might be worth digging around in searchgoogle to get a good answer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit im crying right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op is talking about an inner voice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck is an inner voice im not deaf and i guess i dont have one when i read something i read it in my thoughts its not a voice its not high or low its not foreign or domestic its just thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look it up google is your friend

Showerthoughts,not_removed,some atms accept money you can deposit using them so you can just deposit using coins and then take out notesbills and if you need coins just buy something cheap in the closest shop

Showerthoughts,not_removed,a man sees an ad for a pun contest in his local newspaper thinking to be clever he puts in submissions hoping at least one would win the contest for him unfortunately no pun in ten did

Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i was wondering
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they left it blank as a joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shit either you really havent ever heard this before and think youre original or youre reposting hoping to get karma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,vsauce
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first time posting on this sub sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you may have anxiety
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well were all gonna die eventually best to do it safely and happily
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you really just the brain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck bro that just messed with my day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the brain is the only organ to name itself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how are you the brain when someone dies the brain is left behind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like i am really fucking small and my body and everything around me are all really giving big and my eyes are huge windows the real me is looking out of sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i look in the mirror i cant believe what i see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that you krang
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an enterprise which is morally bankrupt enough to imprison gorillas is morally bankrupt enough to fail to make a gorilla exhibit childproof and fail to know that tranquilizer darts are as fastacting as bullets and then shoot a gorilla with a child in proximity to the line of sight and then manipulate the public into placing all blame on the parents of a four year old for failing to watch their child for ten seconds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am a reddit user and it is my daily source of latest info and i am sure there are many like me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,many more uninformed people that think theyre ultra informed yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends if light fills the room is there any dark to glow in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no but if its compact fluorescent itll likely glow after turning it off or if you hold it and shuffle across the carpet or rub against a fleece blanket
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless you have a motorcycle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic arthur c clarke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude whoa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mind blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ii think i just shit my pants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well the earths rotation is slowing down a tiny bit each year but still we all must be running on that treadmill waaaaay slower cause the human race is getting fat af
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and im the fat guy in the failarmy videos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well when you put it like that same for all the rest of us wait eww everybody quick stop having teh sex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not likely since adam is a fictional character

Showerthoughts,not_removed,dammit is spelled with two m no n
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i knew this dude who broke both his arms and now hes mentioned in every thread
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i knew a dude that broke both his arms too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for the clarification i was between thinking this was rhythmic gymnastics and american history in the century before you let me know it was physics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a sameday repost is the thirdworst kind of repost

Showerthoughts,not_removed,the north pole elves are undercover gnomes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,false
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no opposable thumbs bitch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dunno dude im pretty good at speed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well obviously assuming an octopus could play cards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hello rows on suction cups on all of its eight arms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,octopus challenge accepted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would get the cards wet then no one would play cards with him in the first place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve clearly never heard of copag cards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alright ill say it what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet you think men should be comfortable with dicks in their asses too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure hes talking about becoming a drag queen op should post a picture of before and after
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no advertising in shows and movies is bigger than ever but it looks weird when all the phones are of one brand and everyone drives a bmw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you seen transformers its pretty much a hour commercial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i get your point but product placement inside movies and television shows is an advertisement to you the viewer the characters inside the world of the show dont experience that advertisement my point was that our experience of watching and seeing advertisements and brand logos isnt replicated inside the world of the shows we watch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see your transformers and raise you jurassic world the mercedes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,those people are like superpowered maids who make you clean your own place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could say the same forlike years from now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and they will think our art is silly and our music unlistenable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,insert crab people joke here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah im gonna live forever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the world would be replaced with a new set of people disturbing planet made of people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn those amputees
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and this is why friends they taught us mean median and mode in school smh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it depends how literally you take the phrase third leg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fewer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn you stannis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what nothing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or a extra half hour is nice too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except your brain oooooooooooooooo rrrreekkktttttttttttttttt maateeeeeeeeeee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually more than of area is empty space
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rekt destroyed paintrained
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holds heavy machine gun and fires around ssshhhooottssss ffiiirreeedddd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did someone hit the remote because op is on hush mode oooohhhh shhhghiiiit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op just lowered the average iq of the whole subreddit oooooooooooooooooooo why arent we kings at rroastme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha op should kill himself by climbing his ego and jumping to his iq buuuuurn sick burn we would be too powerful there with great power
Showerthoughts,not_removed,comes great responsibility bet op felt really responsible when he posted this garbage yeah we should spare the roastme guys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he felt a deep sense of responsibility to disappoint conditioned by what im sure is substantial disappointment that his parents have for him in his posting ability spinning in their graves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would call the op stupid but hes probably heard that a lot so ill just say something he has not heard before like im proud of you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha dodges bullets
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i burn cradles full of cats for fun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a nice firm kick in the balls works better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,old yeller the iron giant that episode of justice league where batman has to assist a little girl commit suicide
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i hear it when im a certain kind of drunk i might cry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it isnt decaffeinated and still has some amount of stimulant in it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we had laptops and flip phones at the same time back in the day though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why twins have almost nothing to do with the father
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stfu
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whys that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,think about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its your idea why would we assume that brains can easily interface with tech in that way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if we can map every single neuron in the brain we can understand how every single thought process occurs that being said computers will be of equal intelligence as the brain and vice versa which is my definition of singularity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,said the kardashian complainer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to quote what someone said to me when i mentioned i had no clue who snooki is you are living under a rock but its a nice rock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends on the size and height at least once a frozen block of pee from an airplane bathroom crashed through the roof of a womans house it happens occasionally the faa refers to it as blue ice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because we let them into our lives even if only for hours we leave ourselves vulnerable to their onscreen persona acting is an art art is about creating emotion in the viewer if it is successful as an art form then an emotional bond is created when they die that emotional bond is shaken and the viewer experiences a form of grief which starts with shock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,annoying isnt it everyone dies except for me so who cares
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone poops
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by this logic all potatoes are also poojust saying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everything just looks like shit to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well by that logic all food is also just poo potatoes are one of the only foods we mash up and serve in that form so the moment we chew them up in solid form and they sit in our stomachs before going to the intestines they are in mashed form just like theyd be if wed eaten them mashed up in the first place that was my logic anyway i think too much about potatoes and eating potatoes and loving potatoes this is what happens when i think about them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good job detective gump
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why do i always read milky way as mikey way seriously my obsession with mikey is getting weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if no one wants to hang out with me or talk to me does that mean i dont matter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck you more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,black mirror nose dive episode anyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it happens a lot if the victim doesnt realize how much they drink and at a given time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i got smashed and had some pretty good hiccups every one thought i was going to throw up each time i hiccuped
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i did once though it was unrelated to being drunk i just happen to be drunk and have the hiccoughs at the same time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it happens i only experienced it for the first time two years ago and im so definitely got drunk enough times to get them also saw my ex boyfriend get them only a few years ago maybe your drunk people arent the right age
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you also wonder if they understand your thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pigeons are httpsenwikipediaorgwikipigeonintelligence actually they are on of a small group of species who can recognise themselves in a mirror so they can probably recognise you too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why not people can hear me if i call them a fucking twat and i can still say it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or just the opposite people would realize that everyone thinks those thoughts and therefore it is normal to do so and you would be expected to think those thoughts or you yourself would be considered abnormal which of course you would know because you could read their thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nowhere in the original humpty dumpty does it say he was an egg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are httpsenwikipediaorgwikihumptydumptymeaning that humpty dumpty originally was a king a siege engine or a cannon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like a facehugger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what if he wasnt fertilised
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but we all know he was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,could he throw a projectile over meters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you assuming his reproductive stage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he could have very well been a person it makes the part where he breaks open and everyone tries putting him back together all the more morbid and sad though in reality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my handwriting is worse now than grade
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doing something everyday and practicing something everyday are entirely different
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you practice the same thing over and over incorrectly youre only developing bad habbits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you handwrite every day come to think of it why hasnt my typing improved
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmmmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,years ago my handwriting was dreadful i scrawled everything then one day a coworker commented on my sloppy handwriting and i decided to work on it now i frequently get compliments about it sometimes its just about the effort
Showerthoughts,not_removed,entirely different i disagree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course its different just because youre doing something doesnt mean that youre actually learning how to do better at it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think practicing is a subset of doing something everyday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no computers speak binary knowing code is like mastering waving your hands around emphatically to get people to understand you youre not really speaking a language and you wont always follow the same route to get the same results but you usually get what you want
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so many different languages in terms of languages i think talking computer is quite racist not everyone speaks ya know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt matter the phrase does not mean you dont need to know stuff just know people who do it means that to get ahead in life it doesnt matter if youre the smartest guy or girl in the room if you havent built the relationships needed to advance your career you will come second behind someone whos dumb but has put in the effort to be well liked and trusted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the cases where this was very true the person in question was promoted because they were friends w the big boss despite their complete lack of technical ability thus he had no appreciation for the work we were doing further it was made very clear that no one was getting promoted unless you were already a lifelong friend of somebody higher up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that makes a lot more sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how is the internet a universe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think of it more in gaming worlds sean murrey then created an entire universi in game with no mans sky its coming in august cant wait
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have to look up what nearsighted and farsighted mean every time i see the words two concepts my brain just cannot retain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see near see far
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too male
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not how transitioning happens at all and gid isnt a mental ilness in itself maybe you should find out about transgender stuff before you talk about your opinions on it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just yesterday i noticed my beard growing a tad too large so i cut off a testicle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then the shower thought was misleading and wrong and harmful to actual trans people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,correct
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes helps me find pictures to masturbate to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my friends who just got married met on tinder yesterday i got a wedding invitation where did they meet tinder in fact i know couples that have met and gotten married are engaged after finding each other on tinder thats more success stories than every dating sitelike legit pay lots of money dating siteout there out of my friends i havent even had a good date relationship from actual dating sites why am i here gonna go sign up for tinder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i found the profile of a girl from my high school that i had a crush on swiped right to see what would happen while flicking the bean that night i learned she went into the industry sort of a winlose because i see her nakey but at the same time shes getting reamed by some dude that makes me feel inferior
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine it lasts as long as your day at work seems to now that is a battery
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine if your smartphone battery lasted as long as a cellphone years ago i still keep a burner phone since i only have to charge it once a week
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn thats not the spirit you dont like your job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah my job is fine i just dislike my mgr and get bored sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont they make guns for that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sorry to hear that i wish you the best and i hope your job is again the fun of your life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some are exponential
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats like comparing apples and oranges
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shouldnt they be apple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is ridiculous there are red apples if you mean why dont we call apples red its because the colour orange was named after the fruit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cause apples come in red yellow and green
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true fact the color orange is named after the fruit not the other way around the color was just known as a different shade of red or yellow prior to that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who is this guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice try peta
Showerthoughts,not_removed,years too late with this boring observation do you actually think youre interesting when you point this out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice i bet you feel real proud of yourself right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre probably a pokemon fan thats why youre so angry about it because theyre saying pokemon is illegal they capture animals and train them to fight each other thats exactly what a dog fight is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its an unoriginal shitty realisation that has been posted and discussed to death get over it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice i bet you feel real proud of yours leg right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yours leg what does this gibberish mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought sharts only spoke gibberish my mistake
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah and youre not funny either good to know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stop talking youre embarrassing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yeah youre definitely right about that thank you so much for pointing that out to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a scene in austin powers i think where this family are all sat around waiting for the dad to come home theyre reassuring the kids that we know its been tough but things are finally looking up now your dad has got this job as a security guard then they get the call
Showerthoughts,not_removed,john wick just kills everyone regardless
Showerthoughts,not_removed,batman should at least break every bone in jokers body he breaks limbs and puts baddies to sleep all the time but not the main characters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,part of why deadpool was so good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,literally the batman tell tale games ohmygod
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which is the same mentality that justifies the idea that assassinating a world leader is unthinkable but slaughtering of his people to impose a regime change is perfectly logical
Showerthoughts,not_removed,video games too ezio tears through countless guards and assassinates several public figures but suddenly doesnt feel like killing roderigo borgia in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like governments
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think this trope has started to fade away already
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its also worth thinking about that when the bad guys ambush the goodies the goodies are arrested and taken away but when the good guys ambush the baddies they just unleash a hail of bullets and cause chaos geneva convention anyone i think stargate was the worst offender
Showerthoughts,not_removed,got any examples of this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,once upon a time is the worst at this snow had definitely murdered several of reginas knights by the time cora came around and that death affected her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,taken
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the mooks tend to be dehumanized with full face masks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every hero needs a villain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kotor where you killed virtually limitless waves of enemies to get to the final boss then if youre good you refuse to kill him but he dies anyways and none of it matters in lore because apparently lorewise you only killed a couple of droids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes its the kill or be killed kinda mentality the good guy rushes through the factory mowing down baddies with guns then comes upon the unarmed boss fidgeting with the death ray
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you never watch a movie to the end the main bad guy usually gets it then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there was a second scene when the henchman is killed by the mutated sea bass it changes to a bachelor party where a bunch of guys are waiting for the groom the dead henchman when they get the call but same principle humanizing the disposable character
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont remember this scene at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,xd brilliant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he let the main boss go at one point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i looked up the stats on this once about of people die from complications after a fistfight meaning they didnt die during the fight but got a blood clot hemorrhage etc and died later at the hospital lets assume batman beats up thugs per night on average and works nights a year because batman doesnt take weekends thugs that batman kills per year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why i gave up on that franchise when he had the joker in jail in the dark knight and gets pissed off and beats the shit out of joker but doesnt knock him unconscious or break any bones thats the worst he can do to joker why would joker even be afraid of him after that he literally unleashed on him and it had zero lasting effects
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean how else was he going to get colossus to stop talking right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have a seat on this exposed mangled rebar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was so pissed at this like i have been waiting to put this guy on a spit the whole game and then i slap him around the ears and send him on his merry way this is the moment we have been waiting for ezio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how about die hard every one dies but when willis has rickman hanging out the window off of his arm it pains him when he falls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lethal weapon shoot tons of people to get to bad guy fist fight bad guy get bad guy in neck hold decide not to break his neck however bad guy does something stupid heroes forced to shoot and kill him anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you didnt understand this post the fact that the hero hesitates killing the villain after killing countless more or less innocent people who were trying to feed their families
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think it was cut from the american release
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its during the credits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that isnt funny side note love that username
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he traded the main boss for his son since his son was the one that did the dog killing he then went back for the main boss when the main boss did something bad too now you can say well he killed all the henchmen around the bad guy yeah he did id consider that more of a morbid disarmament though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think that batmans fighting style and probably has killed way above of the crooks he fights unless he has some kind of batdontdiespray in his utility belt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that number would be waaaaaay higher with the way bats fights most people who get into fist fights have no idea what they are doing and are just going to throw haymakers and roll around on the ground batman is snapping arms breaking orbital bones pulverizing ribs i would give bats at the least kill rate for the henchmen also im pretty sure hanging upside down for a long period of time isnt good nor is being unconscious for longer than a few minutes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well guess i know what game im playing next after i beat the witcher and fallout and get to in wow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,willis is looking pained because hes trying to undo the strap on the stupid watch his wife has on which rickman is holding onto it has nothing to do with a sudden outbreak of moral principles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because then it was self defense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was and it was about the steam roller guard from madtv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seriously its one of the best bits and thats saying a lot coming from austin powers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so the henchmen were protecting the father and son so they deserved to die and the dadboss was doing the same thing i would have asked for the sons location then kill the father anyway why would i want any of them alive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well the thing is batman knows what he is doing so you could argue that he would know exactly which stuff would incapacitate people without killing them wouldnt work in real life of course but with comic book logic ill give him a pass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because john wick is a man of focus and sheer will things you obviously know very little about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,officiallycanonically regular humans in the dc universe are tougher than the ones in ours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true he could strike with surgical precision and make sure they will survive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow thanks for comparing me with john wick that makes me proud
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait that is something they actually addressed canonically
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he didnt really compare you to john wick he compared you to theon greyjoys character thats not a good thing puppysquasher
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i also would like to know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he was just quoting the movie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ohdeerlordman was quoting john wick a line that was said to iosef tarasov pathologicalliar wasnt quoting john wick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,translator malfunction gooshie hoshi come in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because the one who invents the cure will still make a ton of money its not like big pharma is all one companythey compete with each other plus cancer wont go away there will still be new cases popping up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think youve mistaken this for rconspiracy that being said im not dismissing this theory i wouldnt be surprised if it were true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so why would the british nhs keep treating people if there is a cure there is no money to treat people here i see where you would be coming from in the us though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you have any idea what a cancer cure would do to quarterly profits even if they would lose money over years the short term gains would be so large anyone with any self interest would release it furthermore if one group found it others will information cannot be effectively suppressed in the modern era
Showerthoughts,not_removed,healing and medicine are powerful businesses when you find the end game there is no longer room for growth and profit the only to a cure is thousands of dollars fear of death medicine profit year cancer survivor years in remission ufullheartsableyes cant lose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well duh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doesnt everyone know this look at the percentage non profits like susan g komen foundation gives to research literally zilch they just use the money to promote awareness they say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,family guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ranonymous
Showerthoughts,not_removed,canabis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,after reading this thread i cant shake the thought that cancer was created by who knows to make profit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet those pharmaceutical giants are controlled by dolphins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if there was one it would be so ridiculously expensive only a handful of people could afford it pharmaceuticals would not miss out on that profit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are something like five or six known cures for cancer cancer isnt being cured because its a multi trillion dollar industry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks but generally was a shower thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe youre onto something and there should be a showerconspiracies hybrid subreddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because then if britain had the cure everyone else would us had so much more power behind the scenes than britain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am a firm believer in economics and if people are willing to spend trillions of dollars to maybe get their cancer cured through much pain and suffering i am sure they will spend many more trillions for a definitive fast cure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there a reason you need to put quotation marks its coz your talking shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the first part of my comment was just a joke im sure it was a real shower thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my point is because we barley have enough money for cancer treatment so if one did exist why dont we just use it to save the money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes please its like a fire truck sitting in my kitchen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who are all you fatasses who have microwaves in your bedrooms not once have i gotten up in the middle of the night to eat something but you lard tubs are posting this shit every night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some people keep different hours from other people they live with its a matter of consideration
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know when someone says im like oh last year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what id do to go back to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the better question is how the fuck did they have a kid together shes a motherfuckin robot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cause he showed her kindness and helped her rediscover her humanity plus she found him cute
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because her only other choices were an edgy scene kid from the future who wanted her dead an alien warrior who hardly ever actually likes to talk to anyone an alien healer who anyone barely even knows at this point a guy whos extremely hard to deal with and annoying yamcha a guy with three eyes and a midget friend whos constantly training and a guy who thinks hes the strongest in the world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wellthey call her an android but shes actually a cyborg she was originally human and as such still has most of her human organs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this sounds fishy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt consider him either first you have to kill him and thatll be pretty tough then you have to decide when in your life cannibalism started to sound like a good idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he is to hannibal lecter what surf and turf is to most people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah no you have your lightsaber on you drop it the wrist strap catches it it swings around and cuts your arm off or possibly cuts you in half not a good outcome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont they have some kind of sensor so they only turn on while in your hand i think when they drop them they turn off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bobfromsanluis has a point there but i just saw yoda throw his into a stormtrooper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some of them each one is unique
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they use the force to activate the light sabers and keep them on if they lose concentration on the sabersuch as drop it then the saber will turn off very few sabers actually had manual buttons just so happens that anakins did
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah if you wear a wrist strap on your lightsaber youre going to have a bad day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its like they all had their dicks out for something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dicksoutforanubis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont they just scramble everything into little pieces
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is there any other way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well people wouldnt mind eating fries by themselves so i guess the latter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seinfeld is that you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i knew i wasnt the first
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha i just thought that too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this actually describes my view on reality pretty well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a sext a if you will will you im just kidding unless you gone do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,steve harvey would not approve
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do you mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know your phone has microphones inside right your phone cannot be smaller than a small microphone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its a pun on microphone being larger than his actual phone inferring that his phone is smaller than micro nbsp really we should just merge rshowerthoughts and rpuns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well that was dumb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so accurate im lost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and now we know your reddit handle elon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,submit it where and ive already written a will thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a myth i have died multiple times in my dreams
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah but maybe everyone who dies during sleep is actually dreaming about dying just because we dont die every time we dream of dying doesnt mean that those whove died in sleep werent dreaming about it 😊
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alright buddy i think you have had about enough lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,either way why didnt i die yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol im just sayin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a dream or real life lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good health maybe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude she was in furious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,man that was a struggle back to the drawing board
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its necessary reassurance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depending on what car you have this may actually be disabling security features on bmws pressing the lock button twice turns the tilt sensor and the interior motion sensor off this is so if your car is on a train or ferry the the movement wont set off the tilt sensor and disabling the interior motion sensor will allow you to leave living things in your car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes i even unlock it then lock it again just incase
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt it odd though we know we heard it lock but we still do it a second time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to add to this more commonly cars with a double lock feature it actually deadlocks the car so you either need to press the unlock button or use a key to unlock the car some cars if you press the unlock button twice might be and hold the button down it will unlock your doors and wind down the windows
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say the longest surviving one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when the elder sibling dies the younger one does not have a sibling to be youngerelder to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i kill my big brother in a fight to the death then he will still be my big brother i will always love him and the fact that i murdered him to make a point wont change that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the elder ones life might be shorter but the elder ones body is still older
Showerthoughts,not_removed,their status doesnt change one just lives longer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a friend whose older brother died when he was on her birthday she had a bit of a freakoutmeltdown when she realized she was now older than he ever had a chance to be it was pretty hard for her to deal with
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,almond milk coconut milk soy milk and many more are not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have nipples greg could you milk me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about milk powder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and now my coffees gone and got me aroused thanks bud
Showerthoughts,not_removed,coconuts and almonds are tree breasts and soy is bush breasts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rice milk and sesame milk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,invader out vader invader out vader
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mine doesnt know that im a pansexual female furry dragonkin brothelowning dominatrix in second life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,checks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and what are you online
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dunno alot of people are into that thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shy hookers play it the best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this reminds me of one video on efukt where the guy starts fucking a hooker in the ass and she starts crying because it hurts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant imagine what kind of sick twisted person would be into healthy food
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oooook
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont you know efukt its amazing and also really disturbing at the same time btw its clearly nsfw because funny porn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kennedian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,arnold was a governor wtf who had that crazy ass idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also fathered a bastard child lets not forget
Showerthoughts,not_removed,she was from the family of john fkennedy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,anytime you see a generic post like this with a weird title and thirdworld grammar chances are its just a spammer padding their account with safe links to look legit but as you will notice op is already spamming his site
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the people of the state of california apparently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that doesnt make it a word
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yupppppp
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would they need something they already have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a little too ironic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it used to piss me off so much when theyd sneak in a second ad after i already endured a second one i never did get pandora premium though i just ended up running away to spotify premium when i realized how much easier it was to introduce people to amazing aural candy from there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im confused
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good idea as its not like people will record that twitch session just to listen to a song they may swell goto the artists youtube channel or itunes but copyright laws wouldnt allow it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldve thought it was the other way around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no but spongebob is gay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when ever im poping pills i think of having them in a mint box
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should try being a pill popping drug addict
Showerthoughts,not_removed,down is beside their bodies the outer feathers repel water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you really believe our species will still exist another years id be surprised if we lasted centuries more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id be surprised too because id have to still be alive in years to be surprised and that would be very surprising
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they have little oval shaped vups to put salene in if you get something in your eye they work like a charm also try putting the tip of the eye drop bottle in the inner or outer corner of your eye instead of over it goes in like a charm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alright ill play along what other way would you suggest i mean its the eye how else would you go about putting drops in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i mean why cant science invent a better mechanism but standing there holding a little bottle over your eyeball trying to apply just the right amount of pressure to release a dropthere has to be a better way if i knew what it was id invent it myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know about putting water in my alcohol but i do try to drink one glass of water for every alcoholic drink i have it helps a lot with reducing any hangovers and i meet a lot of nice people in bathroom lines
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you couldnt pay me to drink water while im drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have none of you drank wiskey with water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or you could just drink a glass of water between every glasscan of alcohol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does vodka and soda count
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that taste disgusting and you shouldnt make your pisswater cheap beer taste even more bad than it already does lol just drink in between them one glass of water instead of mixing it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i drink plenty of water generally since i work in a physical trade but i also try to drink alcohol and water of course at some point im just drunk and swap over but i can most assuredly say that of all my friends i have the least hangovers and wake the earliest after a night of binge drinking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tried didnt like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think youre right in that that is how it was written but within the harry potter universe the best defence against dementors isnt the patronus its crippling depression because if theres no joy left in you what are they going to suck out and by that i mean at a distance no kissing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not everyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same with peeing pooping having sex talking about intimate personal details and a hell of a lot of other stuff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea have you ever smelled one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they arent good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe we have just been using boats the wrong way all this time mega baths muaahahahaha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,very rarely are reddit comments ever successful in real life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it gets trapped in their pants thats why they walk so awkwardly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do they just explode when they eat too much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the best zombie book ive read explains it as their bodies utilizing all of the flesh they eat and thus having no waste products of the digestion process it was supposed to be a part of the physiological changes between human and zombie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they work like aquariums solid waste breaks down into gaseous components and is exhaled thats why zombies appear to breathe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,boomers and the bloated the oncealpha zombies now reduced to popping due to indigestion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you get this from something or just make it up i really like it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well boomers and bloaters are common references for fat zombies and in many games they do explode the rest is on the spot explanation for nonpooping zombies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if the zombie apocalypse ever comes about we better mass produce glitter and confetti would make for one hell of a time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my grandmother just turned years old and she never used glasses yea she drank straight from the bottle 😏
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no theyre already spectercals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its okay to do just as long as youre willing to reassess that judgement one you have more to go on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,defense mechanisms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a first impression how something looks is the first thing the brain processes usually not a blanket statement it applies to pretty much everything that had a physical form
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not fair how we all judge books by their covers subconsciously how many times have you seen someone you thought was a dick or a dork and after talking to them realized that they were way cool and eventually became good friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its what their appearance may indicate the fact they chose to go out into public appearing three way they do is the greatest deciding factor in whether i judge them or not most everyone has a noticeably stained or torn shirt in their closet but most people arent comfortable looking like slobs so they wear clean clothes in public the people that dont care or dont see it as an issue arent bothered by the unattractive clothing so they wear it indiscriminately same with hygiene everyone gets greasymessy hair but not washingcombingpattingtouching it at all before going to the grocery store it sends a message that you dont carenoticefeel its important to do or you think youre normal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats being shallow if you do this you may never know some of the brilliant and incredible people on this earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly theres this guy i know at first glance hes a real worldbeater beautiful wife and kids seems to have plenty of money and seems to know what ehs talking about spend a little time with him and you realize that hes a egomaniac who goes nuts over every insult glad i dont have to spend a lot of time with him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,any higher and i would be notable enough to have a wikipedia article over it and nobody has a because theres always room for improvement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im like a on mondays but i peak up to on thursdays subtract if i havent gotten my coffee may also go up or down based on horoscope for the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,roflshmsfoaidmt

Showerthoughts,not_removed,socks man i can distinctly remember my transition from socks fuck to socks fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,big ass crock pot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,god a floor steamer from my parents last birthday still one of the best presents ive ever gotten sad i waited that long to ask for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,castiron skillets are the best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i was a kid i traded in a game my grandma got me for my birthday took me a few years to realize how terrible that was i still regret it a decade later
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never gotten anything but bedsheets and towels from my grandparents on my fathers side
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol how do you use effectively i bought one but seems to leave water and take forever to get hot enough but i am shit at cleaning lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you kidding its the seasoning of the pan that makes the food come out so amazing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cast iron is overrated the actual seasoning i put in my food is the seasoning that makes my food come out amazing if its something that needs char like meat you just char it with butter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seasoning in regards to cast iron is referring to a process that makes the pan nonstick not actual seasoning like salt and pepper the nonstick coating allows food to be browned baked seared broiled or fried all in one pan i was not saying that the pan gave off a taste
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know what seasoning means in regards to cast iron and im saying its overrated if the pan doesnt give off taste then who cares browned baked seared broiled or fried all in one pan regular pans do all that stuff just fine so does my dutch oven which is enamel coated cast iron no need for extra maintenance either way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,space is like the one thing it doesnt heat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,different kinds of paint are coloured though different processes it would be impossible to get the same colour twice as each dye lot is different it would be very cost prohibitive as small batch mixtures are more expensive than larger batches you could not have a large batch of nail polish sold to the public at one time as nail polish nail polish a public heath risk in large quantities or you could put latex paint on your nails then put a clear coat over it whatevs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i still think spotify sounds the best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how did you enjoy your wax cylinders i found the sound a little mushy personally
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ugh shit that is in low bitrate too you gotta hear some vinyl then you will change your mind 😉
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you gotta go with pottery man really keeps it crisp
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apple is considered lossless 😉
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see youve never met my sistersinlaw

Showerthoughts,not_removed,what makes you think this hasnt happened before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mods
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why the device to create a restore point was called a time machine on mac
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and youre jerking off to it you fucking perv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres probably a lot of younger ones that lie about their age

Showerthoughts,not_removed,viqueens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bitcoins are easily traceable if they arent muxed during the transaction muxing can be instantaneous or could take up to a day depending on the service
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why i usually offer my victims families a ℅ discount if they pay the ransom by bitcoin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it already exist for online black mailing darkcoin is more appropriate p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im going to guess that muxed is short for multiplexed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who ever said that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what about qgpus quantum gpus looks better than real life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i wanna know too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,somebody else said that they should remake the breakfast club every ten years same script different music
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the were more chill the was the real party
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i assume youre referring to the hippies though they get a lot of the spot light very few people were actually involved in the hippy movement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,party is an analogy for societal change
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hippies beatniks all that jazz filtered through the societal ecosystem jimmy dont drink from the well there might be lsd in it uh dad why are you the shape of a vagina because im a pussy son dad that is sexist as fuck bro fin open all night for one minute only know what am sayin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my statement stands

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can knot believe that you made that pun thanks for making me so salty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you show em ya big rebel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,insults are always genuine compliments are more complicated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just get embarrassed by compliments and not really sure how to respond dont want to sound like a braggart but also dont want to sound ungrateful by downplaying too much stuck in a socially awkward loop until i mumble something and walk away looking at my feet insults are easy just well fuck you too buddy and im on my way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate people like literally hate them i work at the parks and the only time someone every greets me really nicely is when theyre scared im going to come down on them usually its smokers who are afraid ill tell them no smoking in the park so ill walk by and theyll be like oh hey how are you doin good so sad that kind of energy never happens unless theres an ulterior motive so i guess thats a lesson to wouldbe criminals if you want to fuck up a park and vandalizedont greet me and if you do dont fucking greet me like im your longlost best friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,compliments are hard to accept because saying thank you for them feels like saying i agree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heres a compliment for you tonight is new years eve im alone my date cancelled i dont drink but ive had two glasses of wine and some killer cheese i bought today for tonights date dont ever forget that someone in this world loves you i love you happy fucking new year my friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats just plain not true there are all manner of motivations behind insults you bastard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,develop into the person that you can be unshackled from the burden of others anxieties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just say thank you and move on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe you should
Showerthoughts,not_removed,usually i agree with the insults
Showerthoughts,not_removed,great point thanks for sharing this is a really interesting shower thought you must be really clever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre a buttface
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i find that people who make reposts are easier to insult
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what its banter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does joking around count usually when i use insults its generally quite the opposite to truth particularly with friends im genuinely more honest with compliments which is why im not the most social to be honest but even still i do think it can be complicated like you said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just say thank you trying to interpret others emotions and motives is the quickest way to emotional exhaustion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what will i do with all this extra free time not obsessing about emotional minutiae
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one time someone said hey youre really smart right i was a couple grades ahead at the time and was a smart kid but how the fuck do i respond to something like that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cause happy dont pay the bills and happy wont get me a mclaren lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol my family gets to watch daddy smile as his house goes dark and he dies of hunger perfectly contented
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be able to grant infinite wishes is way better than every other wish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but if you were happy it wouldnt bother you that your bills werent paid or that you didnt have a mclaren
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe like the colonists of miranda
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like the stipulation against wishing for more wishes is so common that i didnt need to repeat it perhaps i was mistaken
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but see i doubt most people would be happy if their utilities got shut off and i doubt youd be any less happy for not have a its really a situational thing when you wish to be happy all the necessary things will be provided for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,enlighten me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was a plot point in the movie serenity a relaxant was added to the atmosphere of a small outer system planet which made the colonists so passive they just stopped doing anything and died where they were but i dont think thats the same as being happy if you were happy you would still do the things you needed to do to live just wouldnt be so down on it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh thats right now im sad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am a leaf on the wind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have seen many a christmas rock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meh im to lazy to put up christmas decorations well only have them around in less than a month before putting it all away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pizza is love pizza is life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if pizza is a pie chart what is a calzone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and if the pizza is square
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a condensed pie chart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,half pie over a half pie calzone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you trying to square a circle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all these squares make a circle all these squared make a cirlce
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no there are pan pizzas which are round
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how do all these squares make a circle and that ones still green
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lao tzu wrote basically this exact quote in the tao te ching about years ago just figured you probably read it somewhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,goes back even further to socrates i am the wisest man alive for i know one thing and that is that i know nothing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i actually had no idea who that was i looked up his philosophies and im pretty sure if past lives exist he was my ancestor all of his beliefs are in line with mine its crazy all this stuff ive thought about philosophically he seems to have thought of first wow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a great quote
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes yea he does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never thought of this i need to shower more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im just looking forward to the last time this is reposted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what about when it really is the last place something can be like there are drawers what youre looking for has to be in one of them and its in the one what do you think about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rthatsthejoke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i thought i invented it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people do this already usually we just call them illiterate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know about other countries but in the netherlands there was actually a movement that tried to make this the standard unfortunately the wiki article is only available in dutch but httpsnlwikipediaorgwikialternatievespelling under fonetisch spelling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except that its not clickbait in most cases its often clear what the book is and will be about i would call it more of a mcdonalds burger ad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was a fair fight and the mountain won
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sick but noif he had done it the people had wished for retaliation and as it would not have been a normal behavior it would have been killed tothe only slight chance would have been the instant death of the child due to the falleven then people had to have a chance to find out about the injuries of the child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck is going on here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the kid was no martell tyrion had a better chance than that child im not sure you can call that a fair fight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,arent rugby balls also oblong just not as pointed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,golf balls arent circular they have all those dimples
Showerthoughts,not_removed,testicles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,circular is spherical is youve fucked this thread up op
Showerthoughts,not_removed,football rugby ball pretty much the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but in general the shape is circular or the dimples occur in such a circular fashion that when filled would make a perfect circle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no testicles can be almondshaped as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they arent filledso they aint
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right so they are balls that arent circular
Showerthoughts,not_removed,troll thread confirmed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its still circular though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im guessing you think a sphere isnt circular lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of us doesnt know what that word means
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thatd be like saying the moon isnt circular because it has craters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the word youre looking for is accurate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,traffic lights ought to have the number of seconds left for that color in them like many crosswalks would be much more efficient getting people ready to fucking go when its time to go ifwhen to continue through a yellow or whether or not to speed up or slow down at the end of a green
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always thought it would be a good idea to have the current light start blinking when it is about to change colors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that should actually do the trick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre assuming that everyone is unique in the same way ps how do you catch a unique rabbit unique up on him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only a sith deals in absolutes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just because everyone has a singular trait in common does not make then the same think of it this way there are an infinite number of numbers between and but they all start with theyre each still a unique number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are unique just like everyone else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats like saying apples and oranges are not unique to each other because they share the same quality of growing from trees
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so by that logic snowflakes because they are different from each other are all the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the underlying message in the incredibles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just btw that whole snowflakes are unique thing ia just a myth fyi how ironic p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i know they are not all unique that is why i didnt use the word they do however have highly varied crystalline patterns the point was simply that the characteristic of being different does not impart sameness and to imply such is just silly i just thought snowflakes made a good visual
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its very leaky sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah ive seen it it is there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if the floor is really lava
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my uncle says the earth is flat and we live under a dome he hasnt been around much lately
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so because good things dont always happen it must be a alternate reality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ding
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well at one moment you have to spend lots of time and effort to achieve high level in wow while birthdays are just kind of sign that time goes on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the difference is i actually feel like ive accomplished something when i ding
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i though it was a compression sack for gringo farts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no op the tortilla would be the sleeping bag the burrito would be you and the sleeping bag together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no you dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know or care if it actually works athleted all my life and never had athletes foot by peeing on them every time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shower observations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i really do i will wake up in the morning and hold it until im in the shower something about it is satisfying of course i realize im totally misusing this sub
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bruh mind blown i never saw it till now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just like a nuclear apocalypse would be bad for the nuclears
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not following your logic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no nuclear is just an adjective so its only describing a form of apocalypse in your example but zombie is a noun so a zombie apocalypse would be an apocalypse for zombies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op is wrongly thinking that a zombie apocalypse is an apocalyptic event for the zombies instead of by the zombies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ahhh i see what a silly bitch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,since when is there a wrong way to interpret zombie apocalyspe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey you started this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because if your bowels wake you from deep sleep its usually an emergency where every step counts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think goddamn it what the fuck is the closest english translation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the actual translation is the bitch that gave birth portuguese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope not even close
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a heterosexual male so no connotations are inplied and i dont eat sausages but i like looking at the stars on a summer night and i did see a sausage ufo once but its not the same thing is it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i knew someone with a sausage dog named andy once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he was a good dog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,once andy got of his lead and wouldnt come back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its funny how andys name started with the first letter of the alphabet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think andy saw the ufo too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but street creds to andy for not making an issue of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he knew it was much bigger than him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apparently he didnt like you calling him andrew most people were just trying to be courteous since you know when a name is shortened you can be apprehensive about using that title but andy was just happy being called andy there were no airs and graces about him he had seen the big sausage in the sky and knew he was special
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope you are an idiot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no its an instrument
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more like smeared custard shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im usually pissed off because the guy that relieves me is always late at least
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was on a polaris submarine nothing better than seeing our relief crew after weeks submerged
Showerthoughts,not_removed,currently waiting for my relief minutes late
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a dog who hasnt seen his owner for a long time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to work the over night shift i can attest when the morning shift came in they were like angels descending from heaven
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was a blessing when i had a graveyard shift knew for each and every coworker when they will come one would think that they will give me the same treatmet as i did to them when i came minutes early every time taking a bus was a course
Showerthoughts,not_removed,currently working night shift another seven hours drooling from lack of sleep before i happily welcome the day people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im on time within a minute or but the shift after me is almost always late minutes at minimum theres an hour overlap between shifts but we need to go over a few things so that the new shift is up to speed on whats going on sometimes this can take upwards of an hour
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh everytime i walk in i always get im so glad your here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone that is extremely horny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i totally understand i used to work security and the next guard that relieved me was always late since he would come from another job that conflicted with the timing i was pissed at him but also respected his hustle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to work at a hotel both on overnights and in the evenings i would pass my shift off too and pick up my shift from the same woman twice a week she was always thirty to forty minutes late not because she had a second job or because she had kids or anything reasonable just because she had been out the night before partying coming in clearly still strung out on whatever uppers she she had taken the night before heaven forbid though i was two minutes late to work because traffic was bad she would always rush right out the door without doing any of the usual routines i and the other clerks had established when during shift transition i never enjoyed seeing her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this guy wins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all i could think when reading the title was if that shift worker was a dog his freaking head would explode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel for ya once i worked the and the night auditor called in sick last minute i had to work it at the end of the shift the morning clerk was two hours late hour shift
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a shift worker after the night ive had already hours left to go i dont think an extremely horny person holds a candle or whatever they hold to how happy im going to be when i see the day shift
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ughsounds horrible im home and its almost i having breakfast or supper d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the most literal post ive seen on this sub im sure youll do great i hope your cars ok i know how stressful it is to have it in the shop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me driving manual after a few years of driving automatic was like riding a bike it all came back instantly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate going back to auto from manual im always trying to shift into first when leaving a stoplight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heres hoping it is hard to forget or ill be saying prayers for the poor temp cars rev counter 😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i did quite well eventually when i first picked up the temp vehicle there were times where i completely forgot to change gear up down but i get to go and get my own car back now ah familiarity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really a showerthought more like an observation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,twist caps dont create as tight of a seal and they can loosen slightly during transit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i prefer using a bottle opener
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most beers in australia are twist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just drink the whole beer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pwned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like the portrait a person made of a hand drawing itself or the art sculpture someone made of a robot whose sole construction was to pick up and then pour the oil that greased its hinges the neurologist studies her or his own mind in effect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bones pick them up boneless use a fork
Showerthoughts,not_removed,life calculus such awe much oooooh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,versus when you just blame the controller and it actually works fine i assume
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah not just video games but like when your bike chain keeps falling off you your paintball gun is the only one that keeps jamming
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the fucking big mac same size as a double cheeseburger now taller obviously but same diameter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,summoning uhowiswaldo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it does get tiring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes my son
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats an awesome idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i remember during finals week in college i went to sleep at and set my alarm for i woke up on my own at very tired very interesting how good our internal clocks are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whenever i hear a sound like my alarm i get into a panicked shock for seconds before i realise im sitting in front of the computer at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,huh why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,porn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup thats why they said it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt realize you had such an insight above all other human beings that have ever existed tell us more about the future and things that will unfold and why there is definitely nothing beyond space oh wise and knowledgeable one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ints the prevailing theory still that space and time are inextricable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the abstraction space is not the same as spacetime time however is the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some are combustible in fact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no cause you dont hunt for veal veal comes from cow calves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,venison is the word youre after
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in that case smoothies are just tea that no one bothered to heat up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would make them iced tea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah we really do my man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,truly a sad realization that its easier for most to avoid doing the right thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know someone never uses their camera when they dont know which one you mean when you refer to the front facing camera guilty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,orrr they could just use the existing light sensor to do this like many phones already do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my phone has front facing cameras for ultra wide selfies to include all your friends if only i was more vain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre missing the point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess it would be useful for people who wear their glasses indoors though i never really get why they do anyway otherwise if its bright enough out to wear sunglasses isnt your screen going to be on full brightness anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me it would be used in the car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess that might be a legitimate use for it i personally have my gps app automatically set my phone to full brightness anyway except at night so i guess it wouldnt matter for me but for others i guess it might
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect wow you look like mr spock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same with people that say as a taxpayer you know they are going to say some asshole thing right after i believe this joke is by dmitri martin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect could be interpreted as no respect is due
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the point and i dont understand why people dont seem to grasp this saying i dont mean to offend but or something of the like is literally meant to preface something potentially insulting in the nicest way possible now it seems people love to point out that an insult usually follows these phrases but it is like pointing out a bite always follows a snarling dog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dave allen explained a similar thing using words like friend buddy mate and amigo when youre picking a fight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or when someone says not to be a dick theyre about to be a dick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah ah ah i am the reddit count and i like to count things now i shall count the number of times this thought has been posted in the last month four four times this thought has been posted in the last month ah ah ah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respectfuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reminded of a quote from a character in my favorite game why is it whenever someone says with all due respect they really mean kiss my ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or im sorry if this sounds offensive but and proceeds to say something offensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect youre a waste of space and should die no offense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect is there merely to add more insult to what follows
Showerthoughts,not_removed,something similar happens when people suddenly say to be honest you mean everything you said before was a lie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect youre the most wonderful person ive ever met
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect you look great today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt with all due respect kinda like with all the respect you deserve which is probably very little
Showerthoughts,not_removed,incontrovertibly disrespectful insult as opposed to the respectful kind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect me ears perk oh boy oh boy oh boy go fuck yourself excuse me looks slightly down apologies go fuck yourself raises eyebrow sir true story
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect i dont use that line with people to whom respect is due
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the less sincere version of bless your heart which in the south lets you get away with tossing all kinds of shade on someone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my mom is a teacher and yesterday a kid said with all due respect can i go to the bathroom i laughed so hard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect i dont mean to be an asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvafidfuxfa this thread made me realize he actually said it twice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect which is none ops mother is a very nice lady
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect i actually like people using this term on me because it means i have their respect in the first place somehow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no offense but youre an idiot okay just saying no offense doesnt mean you can say whatever you want actually it does talladega nights
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect last night was amazing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont want to say that know that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone knows that the phrase with all due respect means fuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that statement is more of a way to put a bullet in the chamber than to actually assist in a respectful conversation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if someone has pushed me to the with all due respect stage i have only one line i follow it with you are a damn fool so you are correct
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect lets have a minute of silence on november
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i laughed way too hard at this because this is literally me in the office monday through friday i absolutely love my passive aggressive coworkers as it makes for some ridiculously amusing interoffice drama
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my response is usually aww look at you paying taxes just like of the country how special also do this to people who use the because i work excuse for everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a better way would be respectfully
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect please stop ruining the circle jerk its not very nice ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i actually give warning instead of saying no offense its usually along the lines of this might offend you but hear me out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect ive been bitten by more quiet dogs than snarling ones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey pal who asked you lol ill give it a look
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nothin personnel kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not to be a dick but id love to be in a warm moist dark tight area right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with all due respect you wanna count how many fucks i give
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your point being what exactly people cant have the same shower thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sorry if this sounds offensive but i delight in being offensive and ill be offensive right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no but dont tell the circlejerk in this thread that its amazing how many people dont understand the real way this phrase is meant to be usedtaken its a polite way of saying something blunt that may be upsetting to the recipient but still needs to be candidly said with all due respect indicates that you do respect them and you arent saying this out of spite or to intentionally hurt them but its something they need to know and understand even if its unpleasant for example with all due respect she was pretty obviously cheating on you the whole time normally if you make a claim to your friend that his girlfriend has been banging hordes of dudes behind his back hes gonna get pissed and defensive and think youre an asshole even if its true people have a habit of ignoring inconvenient truths but sometimes the best thing you can do for them is flat out tell them theyre totally fucking wrong on this one prefacing that kind of statement with with all due respect softens the blow and emphasizes that youre not telling them this to be a dick but because they need to face facts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of the country definitely does not pay tax its more like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow with all due respect why wasnt i invited
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lately ive been using youre probably not gonna like this one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not your buddy pal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a yeast farm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah ah ah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its literally the first rule of this subreddit all content must be original unoriginal or reposted content will be removed »
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only if theyre in the same shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sales tax property tax prepared meals tax its probably more like youd have to expend a significant amount of effort to not pay tax or literally live in a cave in the woods or something in america at least
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i respectfully ask thee to remove thy self has thou not checked ones privileges
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol at the idea that you guys are insulting enough on a regular basis to have a couple options to pick from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not your pal guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not your pal chief
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so then remove it do you really think everybody on here is going to search through years of posts to see if a random thought they just had has been posted before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,really only when im telling my girlfriend my opinions about stuff i dont think my dislike of harry potter is offensive but after this much time i have learned of others sensitivities
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not your guy friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its way more fun to think of you walking down the street just dishing it out to strangers mrs your probably not going to like this but your baby looks like gollum excuse me sir this may offend you but those shoes are hideous
Showerthoughts,not_removed,phosphorous from human urine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im guessing a lot of chemistry has its roots in alchemy which required us to describe and categorize substances
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was what inspired this random thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im now and tell my dad when to go to bed full circle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so which app is that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at years old man i dont wanna go to sleep yet its just me at its i need to be in bed now to have hours of sleep and wake up for my hour commute in the streets in the sheets
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at years old i dont want to take a nap fight for hours me at years old looking at the time with excitement oh look at thatits almost time for my nap d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at years old i hate sleeping i wanna play games all night me at years old i love sleeping but i cant resist playing games all night i think im fucked up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yrs i dont want to go to bed yrs i still dont want to go to bed but ill feel like poop if i get less than hrs sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i might be the minority here but i sleep very little i hate going to bed and will do almost anything to avoid it theres so much to do and so little life to do it oh im btw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can not express how much i love naps
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at theres nobody to tell you to go to sleep instead there are plenty of people telling you when to wake up which is much more insidious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i was a kid i thought being old would mean stay up late everyday icecream everyday no more veggies no more cleaning my room if i dont want to only the room cleaning thing is true now ive got my own hobby workshop that can be as big of a mess that i want and the veggies i try to limit the veggies the vegetarians need it more than i do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you use a fitbit or some other wrist device to track your sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sleep at years old gets in the way of your life at your life gets in the way of your sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my optimal bedtime is four hours ago you stupid stupid fuckwit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good point im glad i didnt get that now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i drop my kids off at school i get excited to come back home and sleep an additional hour before my day begins when i was a kid i did all i could to fight going to sleep but now i find it funny that its reversed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh man i could so totally go for a good nap must keep working
Showerthoughts,not_removed,willing obedience is always better than forced obedience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at years old when i grow up no one will tell me when i have to go to bed me at its on a friday i have work in hours man i wish i went to bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and as you get closer to itsget out of my way im going to bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at years old when i grow up im gonna stay up past midnight every night me at damn its almost already im ready for bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,serious question what is the name of that app
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at fall asleep on the couch at pm

Showerthoughts,not_removed,if anyone is looking for an app sleep as android is pretty good android only though

Showerthoughts,not_removed,my mom never told me when i had to go to bed as a kid but said i had to be up at no matter what she thought i would eventually get it and go to sleep earlier but nope learned how to operate on hours sleep

Showerthoughts,not_removed,alternatively u just go to sleep when u feel tired
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am scared that if i take a nap the world will end and i wont be there to see it

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have sleep apnea so when i go to bed i am put on this machine the machine awards me gold stars if i sleep well enough and keep on using it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,after using such an app for a while it dwindled down to just clearing the notifications and sleeping whenever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nada you dont need an app to analyze your sleep quality you just need a brain to do it yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i need this app whats it called
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used sleep like android for a while and got a tad obsessed with it going over the audio recordings and even spending a few months wearing a heartrate monitor while sleeping it got so bad i would wake up at night to go have a pee and i would spend hours checking the logs from sleep i already got to then miss several hours of sleep because of that now i just go to bed when tired take naps in between and catch up on whatever sleep i missed over the weekend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at kids in bed by me in bed by
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what app do you use
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a man needs a name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have that app actually helps a lot on a side note it shows that im sleeping less and less each day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,responsibility is the ability to become your own parent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the difference is that the algorithms can calculate when its the right time to go to bed but my parents told me when to go out of pure arbitrary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,somebody isnt married
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats the name of the app
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how ironic i just hada nap because my brother woke me asking if i feed the fish also i almost fell asleep at the dentist todab because i only slept hours today

Showerthoughts,not_removed,and yet i still end up sleeping at am and waking up at am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at years old conks out at pm me at years old still conking out at pm due to gym at am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its still years until then but i doubt ill let an app decide when the best time for me to sleep is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah ur body needs to hours of uninterrupted sleep to do maintenanceso to say not allowing this to take place has short term and long term effects lack of energy stress cognitive function goes down as well as physical health only a very small of the population is able to have a less sleep but thats due to them being not normalmeaning run of the mill human beings

Showerthoughts,not_removed,a year ago id look at the clock see that it was and maybe think about going to sleep now i look at it see that it is and wonder why im not in bed yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what amazes me is that there are so many people who trust the sleep app that optimizes their sleep when it literally just tells you what you already know go to fucking sleep at a routine time where your body adapts to that schedule
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hour commute please no tell me this is your dream job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you only get hours of downtime really wow side note pretty envious you can get hours of sleep a night im lucky on most nights if i can get ☹️
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wtf hour commute and sleeping from to and working to means you have two hours in your day to take care of shit and to relax fuck that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone makes fun of me because i am in bed at pretty much every single night im usually asleep by it just feels nice to wake up at am min before my alarm and feel rested and ready for the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe dont spend hours in commute
Showerthoughts,not_removed,waking hours to do what you want thats rough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hour commute i hope you drive something with great gas mileage dat carbon footprint time and money lost i hated going from min commute to mins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive circumvented this by only sleeping hours a night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like it when i wake up look at the clock and realize i can get some more sleep in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me it is i hope i can sleep i want to sleep so badly and next day fuck another night with only hours of sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nap who are you a saudi arabian prince
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it seems counterproductive to be excited about a nap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do you do that you have time for two naps at side note i hate naps cause i am too tired after them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right after youre done with breakfast
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at i need sleep so desperately me also at finally kids in bed all work done and i need to get up on the morning at time to start watching a movie at in the night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nap after breakfast
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because were being forced to nap as kids when we dont feel like it i enjoy taking naps too but if someone were to force me to take them id be annoyed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at years old why wont the baby go to sleep i need a nap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,year olds dont take naps though they have school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me at is an excellent bed time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relax and ye dislike it seems like the country deserves to be eaten
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes almost always i wake up early on my day off just so i can take a nap literally get out of bed earlier than i need to just so i can get a nap in later in the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yes i always remember that in school i hated the forced naps now a high school senior two months away from graduation i would give anything for naps during the day

Showerthoughts,not_removed,you might be addicted to norming but youre perfectly gaming
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive got an inclination you may be addicting to gaming but i think youre perfectly normal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the evening i dont want to go to bed but in the morning i also dont want to wake up as early sometimes i wish the day would last hours so i can sleep but also be awake edit typo i meant not hours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,brother
Showerthoughts,not_removed,years old i dont want to go to bed now my brain doesnt want to go to bed but but my body is very very tired

Showerthoughts,not_removed,rnonap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so much to do like browsing all reddit from newest posts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that sounds lovely too bad i would either kill someone or jump of a bridge if i dont get enough sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i also question why people get these apps i dont need an app to tell me that college isnt allowing me to have enough sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,enlighten me on how you have this awesome outlook on life getting older has really blown for me tbh i find myself reminiscing about my college and high school years im btw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whyyouhatetheinternet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sleep is vital for health you may be chipping away at that little life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,once i have a nap i dont get up i try to avoid them as much as possible

Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because hes dead jim
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just change the channel seems to be a sure fire way to wake up any dad no matter how deep of sleep theyre in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when im with my dad i end up yelling go to bed every minutes because hes snoring on the couch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dammit jim im a doctor not a reminder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it bothers me when people do this when you sing it you dont pronounce the e so you shouldnt write it that way its more accurate to write circle of liiiiiiiiife
Showerthoughts,not_removed,used to work in a warehouse with a guy named simba he was going to school so he only picked up a couple shifts now and then every time i saw him i would sing at the top of my lungs iiiii like simba hes a really cool guy and a hard worker in the tune of the opening to the circle of life it always made my day i really miss that kid he was a really cool guyand a hard worker

Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone lying on reddit this cant be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well op said theyre both and i think theyre lying too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in case theres a nonamateur snoozer math bah solve that shit in a moment and go back to sleep reading this morning routine is your friend to wake up you can set multiple steps of waking involving the most useful feature for me to turn the alarm off you have to scan a barcode of your choice i use my conditioner as that forces me to get up and slowly crawl to the bathroom which will usually wake me up enough to not fall again also used coffee filters good way to start routine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i use sleep cycle for ios as well they offered a premium version for €year and i cant praise the app enough sleep pattern analyzing ez waking up stats have to charge phone every night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sleep cycle is cool indeed though i cant remember it having the functionality op describes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sleepytime
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the lack of ratings in the app store dont do it justice using it in parallel with an apple watch is awesome too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive worked from home for a long time years ago i could do wtf i wanted to with my sleep schedule now i can do the same thing but if i dont get up at around ill wake up to my son having destroyed my house and potentially have jimmied the lock on the front door and had a run around the neighborhood
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but does your natural rem cycle have google drive integration
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant plot cool graphs with my memory
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not my brain it will consistently convince my body that i can stay up longer no matter how tired i am so dumb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heavens no theres way too much human interaction for it to be my dream job hours is my worst estimate to allow for traffic like that one time i was late because there were three accidents along the way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty much ive been waking up something like an hour early lately so i take it that ive got an hour leeway if i need to sleep later never really felt safe to risk it though plus i love watching my dreams but yeah a friend of mine also cant get that kind of long uninterrupted sleep and i feel really bad for you guys because lord knows i can probably do with half the amount of sleep i get meanwhile others cant get restful sleep and are suffering for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to hours of sleep damn i feel lucky i can usually get to although last night was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a gf who did this to an extreme goal we have to wake up at to leave her alarms at it was incredibly annoying though thankfully i eventually got her to turn them all off when she stayed over with me before trips took her a good like minutes though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my so loves doing this on purpose i hate it because i wake up every minutes from to by her alarm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,best part of my day is getting my sleep in before i get my naps in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sucks bro happens to me sometimes tooo try smoking weed always puts me out unless you are underage then dont listen to what i say

Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive taken two naps a day before although only like twice ever those times have been when i woke up early and was super productive i was ready for a nap around then maybe later again around i work from home and listen to my body i tend to nap times a week if i need it needing it less now im putting significantly less stress on myself when i was overworked and burnt out working at a job i hated i napped for over an hour every day when i came home from work without fail oh yeah also havent set an alarm for months and wake up naturally in the morning its really fantastic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe hes funemployed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same here me during the day so tired i cant wait until work is done and the kid is in bed eyelids sooo heavy me at night after the kid is in bed hey look its almost time for me to go to bed let me get some gaming time in then suddenly its midnight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are working too much if you cant get some time off before in the evening even with kids spending two or three hours per day doing chores or even more if that is work is overdoing it i have to say that im an upcoming mother myself and hell no im not gonna clean the house every single day not worth it especially not with an infant around you get so much more time for yourself if you just keep those chores down to an absolute minimum speaking of personal experience only vaccum cleaning once per month or even less here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly my life lol im up till because im finally alone and can watch my shows without someone bugging me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was homeschooled and i slept like this in highschool because i never had to be awake at a certain time awake for sleep for i loved it i never had a problem falling asleep because i was so tired by that point and every time was like sleeping in the only downsides are a schedule completely unconducive to a healthy social life and also sometimes if you stay up late youll start hallucinating
Showerthoughts,not_removed,newtons first law among other phenomena a body at rest will stay at rest unless acted upon by force edit to keep usurrealjay happy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like a bath i dont want to stop what im doing to go shower then i choose to pool the hot water in the tub so i can lay in it as long as possible periodically adding some hot water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im the same way i hate going to sleep and with do anything to avoid it but ill also do anything to avoid getting back up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you sleep for hours assuming an hour for getting ready and going to work wew rmadlads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive yet to figure out if its just a thing about working nights or the type of people who work nights seem to have a complicated relationship with sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey im the same way like exactly the same i work gmt hours so about the next day i typically go to sleep right around and wake up at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too me too but i think it might be an occupational hazard i either sleep extremely little or cant be woken up its like the sleep i get in the day counts for so little there isnt a point in even trying when i am asleep im on edge too ill lash out violently at anything that tries to wake me up i wasnt like that when i slept at night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unfortunately this is me as well i love sleeping but hate going to sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish i could work a schedule like that again when i was working a night shift at my previous job i got the best sleep of my life during the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if there was a pill with no ill effects that allowed me to never sleep id be on that shit

Showerthoughts,not_removed,college isnt allowing you to have enough sleep sorry fam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,these apps are actually effective even more if you cant have enough sleep you state an hour at which you want to be awake and itll sometimes wake you up minutes before that for optimal waking up stage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a year old daughter i absolutely adore and live for so much to do with her i cant wait edit dont get me wrong i had a fucking blast in my younger years but i have a new reason to be alive if you will
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im the same way mine arent naps theyre full on sleep and i dont want to get up i phased out naps for my son when he hit he cant nap he has to sleep for no less than hours and then he cant sleep at night plus wake him after a hour nap and hes a nightmare every stupid tiny thing is horrible and youre just trying to do anything to make it stop like im sorry i woke you up please go back to sleep but noooooo he doesnt want anything but to sit there screaming and crying over absolutely nothing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im the same my alarm will go off to wake me up from my nap and ill think i have time for ten more minutes so i press snooze and then i press it again and again and again until i finally say fuck it and turn it off all together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had ice cream for dinner yesterday and i dont even feel bad im an adult i can eat whatever i want for dinner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i charge my watch when i sleep if i was running a sleep tracker on my watch i wouldnt have time to charge it how do you charge it do you have a long cable and still charge during sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til that apple had an app for that i thought you were going to say sleep as android
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so accurate it hurts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends if a general tells to unwanting conscript to advance it is forced if this conscript is willing to then it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone knows the end of the world happens when you least expect it call me paranoid but im really just saving everyones life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or wake up in a panic not knowing what time it is and assuming youre running late for work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this why i will die alone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,savage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because hes jim dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes dead jim
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so should i be worried that hes never in bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but how can he be not already sleeping if hes already dead thinking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe he listened a little too well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damnit jim
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or mess with the thermostat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,especially if your dad falls asleep to cspan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you people get this wrong all the time and whenever i point that out im the asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,preach
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the circle of lifeeeeeyyeyyeeyyyiiiiiiiiiyi maybe thats how theyre doing it irl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude dont comment on peoples names they didnt pick it and theyve heard it all before im sure he remembers you as the person hes met to comment about the lion king whenever they learned his name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nap in peace
Showerthoughts,not_removed,napspeed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to think i wanted to know when it was happening but now im pretty sure that id rather die during sleep like my grandfather did and not scared and aware like the people in his bus were
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorryspirits heard die during a fapnow your dad finds you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true am definitely dont want to wake up ever again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its the worst day of my life the worst day of your life so far simpsons probably
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the reality is you had someone else telling you how to live and like a sheep you followed their path
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people who are years old dont joke about death it stops being funny when its imminent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you really think someone would do that go on the internet and tell lies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,replace and for multiplication and thus op is years old
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love sleep as androids capthca implmentation and change it up frequently currently i have a two stage captcha first i gotta shake it then i gotta solve some math thats been enough to get me awake and checking my notifications while still in bed you could have it so you have to perform all the captchas in a certain order to turn your alarm off go from laying in bed solving math shaking phone searching for sheep then have to get out of bed scan an nfc tag scan a barcode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have the math thing but i solved it in my sleep today and came late to school anyway guess im to good for my own best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i tried this too it worked the first day the second day i discovered i could just turn my phone off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so youre suggesting i sleep with the conditioner bottle next to my bed gotcha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have an nfc tag on my coffee maker that i have to scan to shut off the alarm it has been working great at getting me out of bed and moving
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what math does your app use ive had apps that had you solve things like man that is impossible for me when im just waking up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,math bah solve that shit in a moment and go back to sleep theyre not called functions for nothing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im om my day dont really use the statistics for anything in particular but i find it kinda funny to glance over them occasionally especially now that i have an actual decent sample size
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have days now in this app and definitely recommend i advise everyone to use the sleep notes premium only to really see what is affecting your sleep and use the app to its full potential
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the website i linked the android app
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn kids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it does if you updated to version
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a fucking idiot i actually read your comment and thought ooh is there a new google app to track your driving or something when i looked it up in the play store i realized i need to get more sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn do you commute via driving because if not at least you can utilise the hours doing things you love we are talking about you spending days commuting on the road per year out of the days of weekends holidays you only get im sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont you ever feel like you wanna do something other than sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah sometimes i lay in bed awake for a bit but i usually try and fall asleep around my problem is that even if i go to bed at am my body still gets me up at am no matter what so id rather go to bed early and get enough hours of sleep i cannot sleep in for the life of me doesnt matter if ive been drinking all night my body wants to party at am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and i thought i was extreame with my alarms at and when i have to wake up at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who the hell sets an alarm for hours before they need to actually wake up madness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck me i love napping but even im not that bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that seems incredibly unhealthy for her sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,very unhealthy sleep pattern as shes never achieving rem sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,am id maybe be and at most
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow i thought i was bad i have and i accidentally snoozed all of them this week and was late to work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my exchange student living with me right now has this exact thing since we wake up at he has alarms every minutes from an hour and a half before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh thats interesting i do that too but alarm wise i only focus for the hour period wouldnt wanna do that from wtf lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,huh so she pretty much time it to get absolutely no rem sleep during the night what the fuck bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure she would have some crazy dreams i tend to have all sorts of dreams and lucid dreams cause i wake up every so often later hours since i dont snooze just more of a natural habit due to my lucid dreams
Showerthoughts,not_removed,had a gf like this i started pushing her off the bed at the second snooze so she stopped doing it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg my husband does this too and it drives me freaking crazy hell set ten alarms with the first one hours before its time to get up worse hell sleep through all of them and ill have to get up to shut them off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a roommate like this too we had to wake up around the same time to go to work except she intentionally set her alarm hour early so that she could snooze times before she properly got out of bed so in practice i woke up an hour before her i moved out after a year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like you need to start forcibly kicking her out of the bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every girl ive been with does this i dont get it is it just a girl thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hi are you my cat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im i do what i want mum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i smoked when i was younger even grew it myself but i dont like it anymore these days makes me feel very uncomfortable and anxious i take melatonin to help me sleep but it does not help every night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i smoke every night before bed and i normally just pass out right after but i find that i usually wake up after two or three hours and cant go back to sleep no matter how much more i smoke maybe i should just smoke before naps and not before bed time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im and i fucking love naps
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish i could sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true but i mean excitation reduce your likelyness to fall asleep no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,johnny depp once said you talk about nights sleep in your the way you talk about drugs in your
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fucking work getting in the way of good naps
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes being cheeky if youre excited it will be harder to fall asleep therefore its counterproductive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some people just arent nap people i hate falling asleep during the day as it rains the rest of the daynight for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont say nap is counterprooductive i say beingcexcited about napping will disturb your nap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,especially for reddit standards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i ran a similar schedule when i was working my own business from home people hated me cuz i was awake different times each day of the week so social life went to shit but i was fully rested and got a ton of shit done adhering to a hour clock really sucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like when you want to stay in bed and surf reddit but your bladder has other plans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is mayonnaise a force
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont want to be the armchair psychologist but that is a strong sign of depression
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a complicated relationship with mornings weve decided its best if we dont see each other too often
Showerthoughts,not_removed,adderall is pretty close
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the problem being the app cant actually force you out of bed and you use those minutes for more sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha sounds exactly like my kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine reading this comment years ago charging a watch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,itll charge fully in like minutes so i just charge mine while im showering and eating dinner at night then again in the hour between when i wake up but before i leave for work its usually only down to like overnight while sleeping it doesnt use much battery
Showerthoughts,not_removed,either they charge it throughout the day at work or during lunch or they have watches with extended day battery lives and can afford a few days of sleeping with it on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably tis too bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,randy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes dad drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well excuseeeeeeeeeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmmmmmme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am just here waiting what will happen to all those khaleesis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he loved it im a pretty respectful person i asked if he cared he did not edit besides you probably piss people off unintentionally too everyone does he also paid back in kind by calling me stuart little we were friendly and it was an inside joke leave your judgement at home
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you simba if so im sure an apology is in order otherwise the dudedudette was making a parody song that praised his efforts as a worker i found it endearing if anyone with a recognizable name is annoyed by it all they have to say is hey ive really heard it all can you please avoid making references about my name until then you cant say for sure that it is rude or inappropriate on someone elses behalf maybe some people enjoy the attention their name brings one cant really say for sure without being in that specific situation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,control yourself animal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rdadjokes is leaking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pop pop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a long straight road ahead just a ten seconds nap wont harm anyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i doubt people actually die in their sleep i feel like people probably die in bed but whatever it is that kills them likely wakes them up eg painful heart attack respiratory failure etc whatever it is that usually kills you is rarely instantaneously even if your heart stops youre still conscious for a good seconds or so before you lose consciousnessbut even still hearts rarely stop instantly it usually putters out in an irregular but declining rate heart attack
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have terrible insomnia that i just stared trying to correct at years old the shitty part is i think it was self induced insomnia my whole life ive been so afraid of falling asleep and not waking up that i actually fear sleep it is so bad that i literally fall asleep with my eyes partially open most of the time i usually stay awake until my brain finally just says you know what self fuck this shit we need rest right now i have to take ambien and benadryl to be able to fall asleep at a normal time earlier this year it was mg ambien and benadryl sleep problems suck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bruh im and you guys are fucking frightening me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,am can confirm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,am year old father of little kids i just want to sleep period
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you either dont know very many octegenarians or the ones you do know are lame af i live in florida the land of old people and get together with an elderly crew once aweek theres nothing they wont joke about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i disagree some people joke as a coping mechanism see the entire plethora of subreddits such as rmeirl and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they definitely do i used to work for lifelock and w majority of our customers were elderly whenever one would renew their accounts for the year a good portion would make a joke about not being alive by then anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wrong my grandpa joked about his death from his until he died a month after his birthday hes not a jokester so they were always awkward to hear about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like tons of old people joke about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bob hope dying at the age of was asked by his family where he wanted to buried i dont know he told them surprise me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the power to finally discover a cure for cancer lays in the brain of a heavy sleeper only to be awoken as a snooze captcha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just turn my phone off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ssssssh thats a thing i try to wipe out of my mind in order to not remember it when morningzombie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to do similar i put a nfc tag under one of the bathroom cabinets and had to scan that was working really well till i cheated and just turned phone off i just set an alarm away from bed now to force me to get up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup it was that way the first two weeks with operations like that but i learnt to solve them mentally and if you set their difficulty too high you end up using a calculator which defeats the purpose of the math problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are these weekends that you speak of never mind hear the year old getting into something i gotta go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he said in the streets so maybe on his off days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,extreme snoozing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do this when i get wasted and have to wake up anyways to do something in the morning like attending important classes and stuff id set an alarm at just to get up drink a lot of water so i can avoid being fucking dehydrated from hangover the morning after
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do this too i find it helps put you into an extended lucid dream state only way ive reliably found to dream at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck rem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe u dont want rem sleep cuz thats where the nightmares are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i pretty much do that except i set my alarm an hour before i need to get up and then snooze every minutes i dont do it when im not alone though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have an alarm an hour and half before i need to wake up otherwise i feel super groggy and terrible with this setup i feel super great when i wake up the second time something to do with sleep cycles being an hour and a half
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i always said it was insane i straight up just told her once she cant slee over if she doesnt turn off all her damn alarms im good with maybe setting an alarm to lay in bed like a half hour but more than that is preposterous
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not even that but im so confused as to how you would know when you actually need to get up if i snooze for more than mins i get confused about what time it actually is i couldnt imagine snoozing for hours and still understanding that i exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i want to point out youre the only person ive seen in this section who sets an alarm for after they need to be up thats what i do too motherfucker im not gonna wake up an hour earlier than i need to just so i dont miss work but i will take a shorter shower or pack my bags quicker if i sleep in later than intended
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah im a guy and i do this but im also like super gay so idk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope my boyfriend sets alarms for hours before he needs to be up because theyre aspirational as if hes really going to the gym at on a sunday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait i do this and im a girl is it a girl thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no im a girl and only set one alarm with no snooze my husband sets ten of them minutes apart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope i dont even set my alarm because my husband and kids get up at even on the weekends i dont have to be at work until not easy to sleep through a toddler pounding on your bedroom door and screaming that theyre poopy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my husband dies this his record is three hours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rmadlads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i took melatonin once and had sleep paralysis hallucinations only minutes into the night wasnt able to go back to sleep for hours after i snapped out of it and havent been able to bring myself to try it again which sucks because i have a hard time falling asleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i fucking loath naps not for the reason you might expect though every time i try to take a nap i end up sleeping the entire day or conversely if i do end up taking a nap thats short then it would just fuck my sleeping pattern and make me miserable for a weektill i fix it i really want to enjoy naps i really do being able to rest for a few hours and at least wake up slightly refreshed would be amazingbut that doesnt happen either i wake up groggier than when i went to sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell yea man naps are awesome wish there was a napping event in the olympics id quit my job and start training hard every day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,love you too baby nap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate going to sleep when im awake i hate waking up when im sleeping grass is always greener
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id love if we just needed a minute of sleep a day being constantly conscius seems like it would drive me insane after a while but a minute off and were good sign me up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why cant you sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sitting here reading these comments with envy as i just sat awake for the last hours lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i jerk off before i go to sleep that usually gets me pretty exited d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is very relevant to my current situation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,horseradish isnt a force either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe but i dont think im depressed i should probably correct what i wrote a little its more i dont go to sleep because i enjoy what im doing when awake and id rather not waste time sleeping and i hate getting up well because im tired because i stayed up to late and havent gotten enough sleep that and when my sleep schedule isnt fucked beyond belief i dont have an issue getting up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i had a good run with that but im done with all that now pill is a fucking miracle pill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no ill effects
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know its crazy we also blindly accept nightly charging of cell phones now my first cell phone in the early went of days on an single charge of course it was limited to minutes of calls a month so it often did no calls or one call each day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bo bandy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hit her with no condom had to make her eat a plan b
Showerthoughts,not_removed,princess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont pronounce the e
Showerthoughts,not_removed,restrain thyne self charlaton
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i thought imagine waking up in the middle of the night suffering an incredible pain in the dark sweating in your bed and all alone in my opinion thats a pretty horrifying way to die when i die id like to die with a loved one at the least
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good fear is the path to the dark side fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering life is simply suffering which means youre on the right path
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh im sure its a cultural thing i live in southern louisiana where the older folk just complain about other ethnicities and bad beer dying is a subject best left not mentioned i guess the elders in florida just live it up while they can
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i was dressed as the grim reaper for halloween at like an old man that answered the door said ill be seeing you again soon was pretty funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never gotten the impression those subs were filled with year olds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this comment reminds me of that morgan freemanscarlet johansson movie from a couple years ago the one with the bullshit concept that humans only use of their brain except this person is approaching use of their brain and she might fuck shit up lucy i think it was called but yeah i imagine that the power of using ones brain is awoken with snooze captchas as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even so the thought of sleeping after a tiring day at work rather than doing something i enjoy just makes me feel like im wasting my life away but then the next morning i end up promising myself to sleep early that night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i did this too just not as extreme i usually had one that started hours before i had to wake up i struggled
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you snooze you lose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know when you would wake up for school in the winter its cold but your bed is really warm and you ended up staying late last night cause youre an idiot so you got like hours of sleep you havent woken up yet and not sure on which planet you are but you see that its a snowday so you just go back right in bed but you end up having the most awesome cozy dream ever if its kinda like that i can get it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,snoozing only makes things worse for you though you need to get deep sleep to actually be rested
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does it really help
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it fucks with your sleep dont do this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cool i guess if you really need to dream its pretty shitty for your sleep habits prevents you from entering lightdeep sleep modes as you stay hanging between barely sleeping and rem lightdeep sleep states are just as important as rem dont cut them out for your dreams unless your dreams are like box office movies good and not even then really
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uuuh dreaming is when youre barely asleep its like the short awake part of sleeping if you cant remember your dreams well or even at all youre sleeping really well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey some of us like the angelina jolie clown with chainsaws for tits dreams
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im glad it seems like you understand the gravity of her missteps shes a monster and she needed to be stopped
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck i do that to but i am not gay should i reevaluate all my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always wondered whats the hierarchy of gayness there must be an alpha gay out there somewhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,username checks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmmm maybe its a like having sex with dudes thing any gay females do this we need to find out what causes this nonsense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont like​ him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im thinking its a bit like second breakfast so maybe a hobbit thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my old roommate used to do it shes a girl im a girl with insomnia so my weirdass opposite snooze where i wake up times before my alarm and then finally give up half an hour before i even have to be up and say fuck it ill wake up now does not count
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were sorry for your loss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go do some research on rem cycles some studies suggest you might be having that problem because you wake up at the wrong time in your sleep cycle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i want to be the person that gets studied during sleep studies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish i could nap if i do i end up not being able to sleep till its time for work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this i cannot stand naps or people who nap if i want to spend time with them but ill be damned if i dont get at least hours of sleep when i can at night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if sleep were entirely optional thats what id like sometimes i just really want a nap even if im not particularly tired its a slow day maybe raining out and im like shit this is the perfect nap time more often im exhausted but getting any more sleep or taking a nap is not within the realm of possibilities so i have to just cope if tired werent a thing and i could just lay down and sleep whenever it appealed to me thatd be cool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stop looking at screens before you try to sleep or when you decide you cant sleep yet its whats stopping you screens light which means no melatonin thinking about being able to use screens brain awake so cant sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are excited after you jerked off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never give up never surrender
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nor is tartar sauce
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bobody
Showerthoughts,not_removed,banana fana fo fandy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and im sipping on that codine not brandy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im glad im not the only one who thought of this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,excuseeeeeeee mmmmmmmmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,excuseeeeee moiiiiiiiiii
Showerthoughts,not_removed,halt your urges knaves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would it be possible to learn this power
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i worked at a rehabilitation center for the elderly in florida and the residents there had some surprisingly light views on death i even witnessed a personal death threat by one of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it isnt but the point is that many people joke as a coping mechanism like i said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you struggled because constantly being woken up by alarms stopped you getting enough sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bro you hear a noise and wake the fuck up its called survival
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imim im aroused why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes it helps a lot i would wake up at without hardcore headaches so it works in a way or another
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yeah waking up a few hours early to hydrate and take some ibuprofen thanks uprufrockspants and maybe eat a piece of bread or two before allowing your body to rest more is wonderful for staving off hangovers edit changed tylenol to ibuprofen dont take tylenol when youve been drinking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its better to drink water while drinking and right before bed you shouldnt have to stop your sleep cycles to drink more water seems stupid age has a lot to do with it i used to be one of the people who says i never get hangovers now no matter how much water i still get them its great though because now i pretty much never drink
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well its lucid dreaming its more than just box office good most amazing thing ever i wish i could do that but sleep is realy important so yea you are totally right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you cant remember your dreams well or even at all youre sleeping really well ehh this isnt really true rem sleep is incredibly important as well though for different reasons than deep sleep is important people with a steady predictable sleep schedule which is the healthiest for you actually tend to remember their dreams better as they wake up after finishing a rem cycle and likely a dream plenty of people who sleep healthily dont remember many dreams either though so its a pretty bad way of judging sleep quality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you go long enough without it you can die as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,huh i always thought it was my copious drug use in my early that did my memory inperhaps its just my copious snooze alarms after all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre totally gay dude youre not fooling anyone its better to be true to yourself than to lie to the world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ya you should youre probably gay and dont even know it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im the alpha gay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,his name is adam kovic or lawrence santag i cant remember who won
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why bruce is caitlyn now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same i just finished laying in bed for about an hour trying to sleep gave up and got up minutes before my alarm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like a dream d pun partially intended
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woa woa woa earl gray is caffeinated you psychopath i use that for my waky uppy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,risky click of the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nap with a special occasion like napping to celebrate your friends promotion napping to celebrate your sisters birthday napping to celebrate your millionth nap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rmeirl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish sleep was entirely optional but only for me because if sleep was optional for everyone i bet wed have fucked up schedules
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my wife used to say she had trouble sleeping before we got married really it was just her crappy habits when we moved in together she agreed to my sleeping rules which are simple no tvs computers tablets or phones in the bedroom theres only three things that need to happen in a bedroom sleeping dressing and sex she really fought about the phone complained about an alarm and i handed her an alarm clock she complained about needing to answer if she got an emergency call if someone died or something i told her that her dead realitive several states away would still be dead in the morning now she sleeps great eta forgot my other sleep rule lay down hours before you gotta be awake gives you half an hour to fall asleep and still get hours so many people dont get hours but its important with her old sleep habits my wife was always tired and had high blood pressure after months of doing things the new way she feels great and jumps out of bed instantly in the morning on too of that shes no longer in blood pressure meds her diet and exercise didnt change just her sleep pattern
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good thing you have asshole do you make it wear a ribbon so people know do you often show off your winning asshole what separates you from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is a beast deep inside you it will not die
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kneel before your lord sire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not from a therapist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought it was mostly suicidal and depressed redditors who use relatable memes to help cope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see i misunderstood sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do this too its an issue trying to stop because i realize this lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would not survive then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i was in fear of my alarm clock killing me this would be true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when your alarm goes off throw the covers off and instantly get out of bed if you require more waking up take a slightly longer shower never snooze ya alarm or doze after ya wake up ya get used to it pretty quick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by the time i do all that shit i wont be tied anymore 🤔
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my gf will not be happy to hear about it but sooner rather than later i guess so where should i start my new gay life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the coast is clear you may freely click above and have a sfw laugh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah the old reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only issue is getting home from work at and then having to get up for class at doesnt leave much time to try and chill out before i start stressing about not being able to sleep and the cycle begins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just a note if you havent fallen asleep within minutes youre better off getting out of bed and doing something else for a while being awake in bed for too long while trying to sleep can be detrimental as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never wake up in time if i dont do this and i cant risk being late so i cant stopppp
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont even hear the alarms though i sleep through the first three alarms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and especially dont set your alarm that much earlier before you have to get up if at all if you have trouble getting up set an alarm or two but keep them out of arms reach so youre forced to get out of bed a lot of wakinggetting up in the morning has to do with selfdiscipline which is its own beast setting intentional snooze periods serves only to deprive of sleep and add misery speaking for myself anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had to put my phone across the room so i would be forced to get up to turn it off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you drank enough to be willing to do all this shit to avoid a hangover im willing to bet you will still be tired edit also if your drunk self really loves your sober self your drunk self will think ahead and put a water bottle and the ibuprofen thanks uprufrockspants right next to your bed before passing out anyway and then you dont even have to get out of bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,san francisco
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you sure bout that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hold my pillow im going in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i came accross this chain of links and became very interested in what it means anyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still should try some way to unwind from the previous day or you risk depriving yourself even more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a scheduling issue it can be hard to resolve but its possible im in my now but when i was in college i went to school full time and worked full time and still got hours of sleep per day you just have to figure out how to do it i did about hour shifts on the weekends to get most of my work out of the way then and just had to pick up a few hours each night during the week for class i started in the mornings and was done between or so each day then i would work hours a night after that id typically be at home and ready to go to bed around at the latest and id get up about each morning yes i worked days a week for years straight it sucked but it was easier to do that than the schedules most of my friends tried to do you simply cant function properly on hours of sleep per night long term every now and then sure but not regularly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry to hear about your father of course a situation like that would have to have some leeway for most peoples cases though if they get a call in the middle of the night its only because someone is calling to inform of a death which imo can wait until the morning my mother and i actually had a slight falling out for a day or two about that but in the end she saw my point my grandfather died around one night after he had been very sick for some time my mother called me a dozen times or so but my phone was off i turn it off when i go to bed and back on when i get up i of course called her back when i got up around she was pretty mad about me not answering but in the end once she had calmed down and it had been a few days she saw my point i was still there later that same day i couldnt have just left if i had wanted at anyway as i had to call my boss and such anyway does it really matter if i get there at or either way hes still dead and the funeral isnt for a couple of days theres no reason to run me out of bed at funny thing is it was my grandfather who i got this from he used to take the phone off the hook in the kitchen at bedtime and hang it back up when he got up once when one of his brothers died in the middle of the night his wife actually called the neighbor and ran them out of bed to go run us out of bed and tell us some people are just crazy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you people are nuts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you use your phone for an alarm to get up charge it somewhere far from arms reach somewhere you have to physically get up and out of bed to turn it off that helps me more than anything else you have to leave the comfy zone to make sure the evil noise stops
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same you need a back up alarm clock just in case you missed the first alarms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly this and i swear every single day i decide to use just one alarm to maximize the amount of rem sleep im actually able to get i dont hear it and im scrambling to make it into work under an hour late afraid for my job i hate sleep but i love it soooooooo muuuuuuuuch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just get an actual alarm clock and put it on the other side of the room instead of using your phone right beside you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont understand say you must be up at set alarm for and when it wakes you up just immediately get up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you use your phone as an alarm maybe try out an actual alarm clock my phones alarm doesnt wake me up for shit but as soon as my alarm clock goes off im up probably helps that i keep it across the room from me so its usually an early morning sprint to get to it before it wakes up others
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont keep your phone in arms reach and you wont turn the alarm off in your sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,has to do with selfdiscipline this i have zero selfdiscipline i dont even need the snooze interval i sleep like hours a night xd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea at most set one for ten minutes later so you can lay in bed and slowly start waking up if youll fall back asleep though just get out of bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i tried an alarm app like that too eventually i realized i could just force close the app
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no dont solve the math problem get up your problem is that youre solving it to turn the alarm off and youre training your brain to immediately go back to sleep put your feet on the floor and stand up let your alarm keep going off until youve stood up and stretched then turn your alarm off and walk around do not get back in bed get your heart rate up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you considered going to bed earlier
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please dont take tylenol when youve been drinking its really bad for your liver and is one of the leading causes of of liver failure advilmotrinibuprofen is much safer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ooh i read that high i thought this was like a do it in the middle of the night cuz its healthy didnt know he was talking about hangovers i dont drink just grass for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a little unsure exactly how sfw it is but im pretty sure its still sfw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not always a possibility for students who work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rpuns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not going back to again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this happened to me in an airplane
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can celebrate new years chinese and regular one in a single day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i once celebrated new years three times once in my home country once on the plane when a bunch of passengers were celebrating their local new year time and when i reached my destination there was another countdown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its just because you decided that they wont come true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont let your dreams be dreams
Showerthoughts,not_removed,definitely dont do that with my friends or know anyone that does it the conversation is usually justi went home with so and so last night we banged oh cool congrats and thats that i think tv shows women talking about penises a lot more than they actually do especially specific mens penises
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we dont actually stand around and talk about a guys penis with our girlfriends i mean well talk about it hush hush once or twice buthonestly in any friend circle i ever had ridiculing a mans penis size was never done maybe other women are different but making fun of other peoples body parts isnt cool we dont talk about genitalia as much as men wish we did
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rniceguys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not sure your age but i was just in college and spoke with numerous girls who admit that after they sleep with a guy they go back and pretty much tell all their close friends about size of the guys penis girls talk about their sex and details of it far more than guys do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,perhaps not a specific guys penis but girls certainly reference ideal penis size at least in my experience in university it seems like penis size is a pretty big deal again just my experience but i totally get what youre saying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes close friends discuss every detail of their life with each other but theyre not judging you theyre just sharing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never in my life have heard girls do this or have participated in this maybe its a sorority thing idk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,indeed it just doesnt follow the narrative reddit wants men are disposable and cant really have preferences in women
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the ones who told you that were giving you false information to fuck with you women are hard to figure out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a lot different from ridicule though why is it our fault if a certain size or girth feels good to us i certainly dont think its ever said or meant to be cruel towards men now ridicule thats messed up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea i forgot op was mentioning ridiculing they never seemed to do that just more of the fact the details will likely come up among them but my learning is they actually dont care much about size just know how to use it and theyre happy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bruh i have close woman friends that if im not careful around will get graphic with their penis descriptions i once heard like a pencil as they pulled out a pencil didnt need that one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,possible but for guys when they ask how their night went with a girl its just yea we banged niceand thats the end of it girls go into detail and guys dont is my point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in that case it is not our fault we like small boobs or big butts it is also not our fault if we prefer skinnier types
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bruh i am a girl im trying to speak from experience here i must not have had normal girlfriends then should i feel weird about this i mean maybe i can see girls doing it when theyre youngnormally this stops when theyre out of college at least we dont all sit around and talk like we are in sex and the city you know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah pretty much its not your fault were you expecting me to argue with you as long as you arent ridiculing people you are free to like whatever you like no shame
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was expecting it to be honest based on the popular opinion of most females that its not okay to judge them according to physical features you have fair thinking though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or when somone uses it in a question its really hot temperature wise yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if the meteorologist reporting the weather is attractive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no its not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the definition of what wise because thats not the definition of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you just repeated yourself without an explanation so the definition of what wise because thats not the sedition of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,according to the definition it is its weird to use wise in they way i mentioned because it doesnt not make sense according to the definition you repeated yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pain is weakness leaving the body
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and mouth kissed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or wiped an ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah we also have a little poopoo on most of our buttholes too like right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmm

Showerthoughts,not_removed,wuss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someones gotta do the dirty work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre not making it any better quit making me make it even worse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ruint 😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair even doctors had their favourite recommend brand of cigarettes back then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you trying to justify your smoking habits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a nerd ive been smoking cigs since back in the day and weed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,always
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh me too nerd is super broad theres always exceptions but just a shower thought on how everyone smoked back then lol ash trays on planes good ole days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i absolutely have never bothered i also avoid wearing white
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you are on to something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,goods and services can be exchanged for money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,awe i wanted peanuts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dollars can buy many peanuts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no landing

Showerthoughts,not_removed,a yeah lol ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id take the knife no questions asked no clothes fantastic it just means i need to get rid of the knife and take a shower and the cover up is complete
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a gun store owner sold gun to con tech shooter and he was tried in court and it was admissed because he had no knowledge the guns will be use in a crime or the guy will commit a crime gun makers can be tried if they sold the gun to the person with knowledge of them going to commit a crime or a malfunction with their gun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,koolaid didnt kill people the potassium cyanide and potassium chloride did theyd have to sue the distributors of the poisons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that has nothing to do with the gun manufacturer gun makers do not directly sell guns to private citizens they sell guns to gun stores which then sell them to private citizens if a gun shop owner sells a gun to a guy that is going to commit a crime and he knows it then the gun shop owner is the one that will go to court not the gun manufacturer that has nothing to do with it its like saying that ford should go to court because a car salesman decided to sell a ford car to a guy that told the car salesman that he was going to use it to run over people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then youd have to take the bullet manufactures to court or the quarries that mined the metal for the billets
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup but guns are designed and intended to shoot bullets koolaid isnt designed or intended to carry poison also some people have proposed legislating the bullets rather than the guns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you high
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha yea he was high for sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve never taken drugs have you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this username is great and no other than that shit that the dentist gives you but the stereotype works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks its an acronym ive never hated a dealer tried to kill one or had a dealer try to kill me this post stems from ignorance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also never hated anyone i once loved or tried to kill them that shit they give you at the dentist is nitrous oxide and its great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it stems from stereotypes actually but ya take everything on the internet as satire unless it has real world implications helps a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill keep that in mind next time an ex or an old dealer tries murdering me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,morphined
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would be too easy to cheat the game that way with fitness trackers people are less likely to cheat as theyre just cheating themselves people with fitness goals would not want to exploit the system in order to get that extra kilometre
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if niantic could stop giving me fucking ratatas or pidgies i might come back to playing or maybe give me something other than caterpies or weedles when i hatch an egg regardless of distance needed to hatch the egg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are two problems with this niantic wants to keep tracking server side to reduce the amount of cheating or at least be able to catch cheaters niantic wants their bracelet to sell so giving passive notifications would make their bracelet way less useful i wholeheartedly agree with your idea but with niantic i just dont see it happening
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i understood some of those words
Showerthoughts,not_removed,had this same idea about a month ago rediculous that when im shopping i have to walk around with my phone out to hatch an egg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he should do this it should be by steps and able to run in the background
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have been refusing to play the game since day one because they dont do this i have google fit running integrate with that and apples equivalent and i will be on board i am not willing to drain my phones battery because that game has to be running for anything to function
Showerthoughts,not_removed,honestly screw it wouldnt really care if they cheated like i said in another post if somebody wanted to strap their phone to a paint mixer and go nuts hell to me that is putting in effort the amount of people that would cheat the system in my mind would be outweighed by the massive amount of returning players people who would come back because of a noninvasive and also informative notification most games want to notify you stupid stuff like hey you havent crushed any candies in four days we miss you please come back this notification would be more along the lines of congrats youve walked steps in days a new record also your egg is hatching click here to see what pokemon you got in my opinion that would bring a ton of people back into the game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know your second point is absolutely on the nose i hadnt even considered those bracelets and wasnt aware that niantic made them you almost certainly correct niantic will probably never do this as far as cheating goes that is why i suggested having a daily step limit you could only cheat to accomplish a very nominal amount of distance which most normal people would accomplish anyway just by leading normal lives thank you for your response i think you are correct
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree requiring the app to be open seems so archaic for a game that is so new i know most apps over do the notification stuff but i wouldnt consider egg is now hatching to be spammy i would even be excited by that im sure many people share my sentiment and would actually open the app more often with such passive tracking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they could do steps or even keep the distance metric and use the average human stride as a edit standard so even if you take smaller steps steps for you would produce the same distance result as a different person who also stepped times but with longer strides i mean we arent building a piano here its just about doing it passively if some kid wants to strap his phone to a paint mixer in order to hatch pokemon i suppose he can knock himself or his phone out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you and what im betting to be a metric fuck ton of other people such a simple and easy change to make which could be patched in all the people who have given up would get a random notification saying hey bro you just scored a snorlax from walking around like a normal person with your phone in your pocket im sure a large percentage of people would see that notification and be like oh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope cheating is not and will not be okay sure the system currently is not perfect but at least doesnt make cheating easy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a step limit would help yet it would also severely limit those of us who lead a more active lifestyle its not a daily thing for me but when im out in nature ill generally double that quite easily what i would suggest is a little different but would pose more of a technological challenge use the built in pedometer gps to determine distance but let the server do checks at random intervals to see if the distance more or less checks out if its off by a certain percentage either drop the progress for that stretch or start a cheating investigation even that would have its own drawbacks though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how can you cheat at a pay win game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yet folks are putting their phones on robovacs record players and anything else they can think of now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im another reply i suggested the pedometer to be capped at some hard limit once you hit the daily cap you could open the app and use the traditional gps tracking to have unlimited daily progress this way people who are hiking biking and jogging can get credit for everything they do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,may i ask how this is pay to win genuinely curious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hrm could work although i guess gps accuracy in general could use a boost maybe once they stop being so scared of cheaters they will find ways anyway they can make more stuff client side and free up server capacity for the stuff that matters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice meme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tumblr would disagree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sympathies to you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this shit again all over reddit and facebook yeaterday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your friend must have been high like giraffe balls to be wondering about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my buddy works at the cincinnati zoo cleaning bathrooms and he says mostly at the base but sometimes bow ties are worn at the top but bow ties only and only sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i suggest it would depend on the occasion casual at the bottom of the neck or formal at the top lol this is a fun question thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it depends where the dog is wearing its pants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would it be at the top people dont wear ties at the top of their neck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cincinnati zoo i feel bad for him when year old memelords go there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because inception is not a scientifically accurate documentary when you sleep you dont spend every second dreaming
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep and humans are winning at an unsustainable rate there are way to many ppl on the planet now that we basically have a way to beat anything so farfor the most part that nature throws at us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the open hand up in the air and head bowed is the universal sign of my bad same in cars hand up open palmed looking in your rearview is standard thank you or my bad come on op maybe the problems with you lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you are referring to the middle finger it is far from universal the middle finger is really an american and western thing and a modern one at that otherwise the old shakespeare line do you bite your thumb at me sir from romeo and juliette wouldnt make any sense at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course theres a universal sign for im sorry especially in the situation you described holding up your hand and ducking your headlowering your eyes is the universal sign for saying youre sorry if someone acts like an asshole in traffic you instantly look for the acknowledgement as long as they show hand its usually ok placing your hand on your heart is also instantly recognised but doesnt work in car related situations for obvious reasons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the middle finger is not universal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,placing your palms together like prayer is viewed as a plea for forgiveness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck you is impulsive and shallow to truly be sorry to someone requires more effort than a simple hand gesture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,neither has a universal gesture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if someone cuts me off or pulls a real boner but i see a hand pop up i know they are saying sorry or my bad and i aint pissed at them no more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we do stop be dumb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had always assumed the opposite of the bird was the thumbs up but hey maybe im just old fashioned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the gestures people have mentioned work well you can mouth sorry and actually look sorry clearly communicating your meaning you cant exactly mouth fuck you while making your face look fuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in nigeria its a five finger claw motion and it basically means f you f your mom f your dad f your grandparents f your whole family source nigerian professor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the middle finger originates from where germans would cut off the middle trigger finger of snipers so it became the notion where u would show your intact finger meaning fuck u i have my finger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that most of you are pricks i actually believe that only most of you on the internet are pricks because its a nice outlet for what you cannot normally get away with in society there actually is a sign for im sorry you clasp your hands together vertically its kind of like praying but youre not praying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,these shower thought posts are getting worse every time i see one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as an aside i remember first learning the fuck you gesture when i watched the videoclip fame by irene cara in in which a taxi driver does it to a customer who stiffs him before my friends and i would just call each other names curse or maybe use the throwaway gesture ahh youre garbage i guess we never felt we had to be sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its the middle finger before anyone can hear it and you have to turn it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to add to what the others have said the universal im sorry thank you sign in traffic of you are in front that person is to use your hazard lights for a couple of seconds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well no i thought praying hands meant forgiveness in every culture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about the peace sign
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe its just more common for people to be rude than to be nice as you came to know it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet canada does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact in taiwanese and japanese sign language alternatively raising and dropping two middlefingered hands means brothers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt like the hands together and bow be sort of a sign for sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,face both palms toward someone but keep your hands close to your chest its shows surrender therefore it will show regret
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it isnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just improvise its not that hard put your hand over your eyes and then shown him your palm or put ypur hand on your heart or put your palm on your head whatever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sorrymy badsarcasm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i truly mean that im sorry then its worth the time to say it if im saying fuck you i usually dont give enough of a fuck to waste breath saying it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at least on the road in oz if someone lets you merge ahead or you cut them off raising an open hand signifies thank you or sorry respectively contextually but everyone gets it aussies are the best at keeping it simple haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,any time i sign im sorry in asl its understood by people who dont know asl and thats just because of body language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was grumpy and honked at someone that almost didnt yield when they were making a unprotected left turn across my path the male driver stopped and clenched the wheel the female passenger blew me a dramatic kiss and waved it was pretty awesome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how does this shit get upvoted theres a universal sign for apologizing but not for fuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have thumbs up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about peace signs deuces in the air
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always thought cars should have a mybad light on the back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wasnt it dane cook who asked who came up with the finger did he try other things first like lick my back or something like that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just be grateful you dont live in afghanistan thumbs up is the same as flipping someone off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought a shrug and a frown was the sign
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are actually diffrent signs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah it should fuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true this if i get cut off in traffic i become bloodthirsty and hold a lifelong vengeance unless they open palm of course then it was just a mistake and id gladly take a bullet for my new lifelong friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep accidentally cut someone off yesterday and theu honked long and hard i rolled down my window and gave them the open palm they open palmed back and it was all good again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,¯ツ¯
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seriously body language accounts for a hell of a lot more communication than most people realize
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except in httpsenwikipediaorgwikimountza and the persian gulf showing the palm of the hand is the fuck you and your heirs gesture edit smiddle eastpersian gulf and added sources
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not universal many cultures already have a separate gesture for im sorry such as even in the west where its more common its not universal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you learned nothing from lpt as is almost always the case the op didnt bother to briefly think through what he was writing or he did and didnt care either way he got his upvotes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes exactly this is what i thought definitely recognised most places
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this for added affect you can smack yourself in the forehead first
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you i was like shit that thing i do doesnt mean that fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if he doesnt get it its probably not universal but to that point the middle finger isnt likely truly universal either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was just about to post this thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats basically what i was gonna say oops totally has a gesture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i also use this as a thanks usually when someone lets me merge into gridlock traffic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,come on op maybe the problems with you lol here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought it originated in europe and derived from archers having their fingers chopped off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not true it means exactly the same thing in sri lanka too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if op doesnt know the sign is it truly universal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not universal many cultures already have a separate gesture for im sorry especially in asia even in the west where its more common its not universal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i live in nw us never heard of these or seen them everother than placing hand on heart for the pledge of allegiance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blow me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,finally someone with a rational answer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,instructions unclear broke finger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have myself finger person opposite side of vehicle thought i was giving him the finger proceeded to give me the finger back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,instruction too clear fucked myself in the rear
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah apparently old school french it had something to do with archers being taunted meaning they would only have that one finger left after they were caught by the enemy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hands together car uhm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey america is the world after all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was more parsimonious to say universal in the title than a nonverbal gesture which conveys a particular meaning in many cultures but which might mean something completely different in others sorry for rumbling your johnathans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think an apologetic look can be universally understood the middle finger has no meaning in some cultures though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,will try much hard stop be dumb me dumb now maybe will not be always dumb you teach
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a lot of places think of that as stick your thumb up your ass motherfucking bloody asshole and even then saying sorry is negative about you while a thumbs up is positive towards the other person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til nigerian gestures can be very concise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but how do you do that while driving
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really in some it probably means i cant take your shit anymore please leave
Showerthoughts,not_removed,canadian here i dont think we do we have talked about making a separate car horn that sounds less threatening to say sorry though p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but this is only asl theres many many many sign languages throughout the world even a few differing ones in america like i heard heres a sign language made for black folks because of segregation i think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre in the road and youve just cut someone off it might be best to leave at least one hand on the wheel ahaha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,neil degrasse tyson demonstrates
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its just a jump to the left and then a step to the right put your hands on your hips and bring your knees in tight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with a finger running down your cheek if you really messed up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bs french born and raised living in japan for years never seen either of the supposedly french or japanese ones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha man i thought i was the only one like this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that went from to awfully quickly you should check your algorithm for underflow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep acsoy and they actually just honked once to get my attention at the upcoming red light we were side by side i tapped my chest twice with all the fingertips of my right hand the woman smiled at me sexually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,username doesnt check out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every time i post this emoji the same thing happens i lose part of the arm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,¯ツ¯
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah this right here i mean how could you not know this op you have to chop your left arm off to show that youre sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,vast majority of all communication i think like is non verbal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i need to start saying that fuck you and your heirs fuck you guys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get this i told them this means peace among worlds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it isnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a potentially true myth about english longbowmen having their first two fingers cut off if captured by the french during the hundred years war and it is when someone holds up their two fingers in a backwards facing peace sign edit autocorrected apostrophes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no youre thinking of an elaborate joke whose punch line is see we can still pluck yew pluck yew
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe someone correct me if im wrong that it originates from american sign language where it means you guessed it fuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my point was that it isnt necessarily a universal symbol just because it means the same thing in some places like the states and sri lanka doesnt mean it is universal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im still trying to figure out the universal fyou sign
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if we only use it on earth is it even galactic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe op never leaves his computer chair or is a piece of shit himself

Showerthoughts,not_removed,it might help too if the comic wasnt way over drawn you cant tell whats going on gesture wise because theres too much going on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,type ヅ
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you need to type a double reddit uses as an escape character so it doesnt display it both times i used that char i had to type it out twice to get it to display
Showerthoughts,not_removed,here you go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,upvote for relevant user name you do you fixesshrugemoticon the upvotes will come
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless youre in europe of course then its the right arm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blow me no no no blow me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i may have embellished the meaning for karma but heres a source httpsenwikipediaorgwikimountza oh yes also smiddle eastpersian gulf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpwwwsnopescomlanguageapocryphpluckyewasp not even potentialy true the middle finger and f u long predates that theres no source for this story prior to the story just appeared out of nowhere at that time you might want to say maybe it was a pun using the existing expletive someone came up with at agincourt not impossible but theres no record of that ever happening if anyone made that pun at the time no one picked up on it wouldnt make sense out the days context that is you couldnt have started an enduring joke that circulated through every english tavern with all these drunken war vets without some account a few years later explaining the joke on paper and say if the story were real but no account was ever written down or was written but subsequently lost to history how did this one radio listener come to know this detailed account in when no source exists and no one had ever heard of it its not in any history class its not in any book theres no known parchment scrap sitting in a museums back room as far as anyone knows
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre either too good or too dumb for this world 🖕
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jesus take the wheeeeeeeeel take it from my haaaaands
Showerthoughts,not_removed,drug test ensues
Showerthoughts,not_removed,way over drawn this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if theres one think araki loes its detail thank fucking god people are coloring the manga so people dont have to strain their eyes comprehending the crazy shit thats going on in black and white in jojos part
Showerthoughts,not_removed,looks like a very bad version of lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant i dont have the characters for the face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you actually need to use a triple if you type ¯ツ¯ the escapes the leaving you missing a if you type ¯ツ¯ you get the arm but now there is no escape on the underscore leaving you with ¯ツ¯ yours smile will also be in italics you need to type ¯ツ¯ to get the correct ¯ツ¯ escaping both the backslash and the underscore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont have all the characters on my keyboard so i copy and paste it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks it doesnt help though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relieved sigh of european lefthanded dudes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yeah its not just putting your palm up though at least not where i live dunno about greece showing the palms of both hands to someone after clapping them is also considered an insult together with saying malat alaik
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes sense i said potentially true myth because i hadnt seen convincing evidence either way but thanks for showing me this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,according to wikipedia it is only a western culture phenomenon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lllooolll
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this made me giggle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its one character ヅdzu
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thinking about how this comment needed to be typed to present shruggie correctly for each stage is going to induce a migraine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,¯ツ¯
Showerthoughts,not_removed,add two back slashes to the left arm that simple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you need three
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone knows the universe revolves around america youre clearly too foreign for this world doesnt your country have a fuck you hand gesture i know britain uses a different one than america i think in involves two fingers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,¯ツ ¯ its rayman lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess im stupid because i dont understand what you mean dzu
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and he did it without any edits very impressive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpiimgurcombkhnlampng
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just so you know i just saved your comment to be forever able to just copy your fucking shruggie bc my app allows me to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i copied it and pasted it in my comments and lost the arm in the process i read an article on how to type it but apparently i need a chinese keyboard which i dont have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we use both also have the wanker hand gesture for backup
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if different countries use different hand gestures then there isnt a universally recognized fyou gesture by definition
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you miss an s at the end of your second sentence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,brit here we have many two fingers is fuck you facing towards oneself its peace one finger is up yours three fingers is im not certain what im doing but be confused dammit miming a handjob is fuck you theres more but the unofficial bcl british curse language is kind of a pain to explain in detail nodding has at least variations that mean different things depending on how you nod
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what the character is japanese katakana for dzu
Showerthoughts,not_removed,res shows a preview of your post before you hit save allowing you to proof read and futz with formatting its still impressive and now probably resourceful to boot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,¯ツ¯
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no you actually dont literally copy and paste it then add backslashes to the left arm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how about thumb biting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i only know about the two finger variant because i saw it on red dwarf i just assumed all britons used it still haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i see thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the hitting the inside of one elbow and then then throwing your arm up one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the turning around bending over and shuffling clockwise whilst playing oh my darling clementine on your bumcheeks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your bank teller should always count out the money in front of you it would be like the atm dispensing bills one at a time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i run a small business getting change at the bank for my cash drawer they rarely if ever count out singles bundled with a rubber band in the amount of i always count it at their station and frequently count or in the bundle havent counted for some reason nevertheless i make sure they know their system isnt perfect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe because it would imply you dont trust that person to do their job properly which would be a little awks to do in front of that person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cheeks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dog gets so freaked out when his farts make noise what was that hilarious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see youve never met my dog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dog does the funniest noisy farts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,excuse me but my dogs farts sound and smell like a grown ass mans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my pit farts more than i and louder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the reason human farts are audible is because we flex the sphincter trying to control it as to not make any noise a dog on the other hand lets nature do its business and as a result the air flows naturally avoiding any vibrating sphincters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my farts are gold
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dog farts every now and then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sigh why dont dog farts almost never make any noise but human farts almost always do ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have no memory of ever having noisy farts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same i havent met your dog either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same here boxer they are known for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you my friend are missing out on a very simple pleasure in life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know ive said that many times myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the sort of crippling anxiety that topples a perfectly respectable morning wood smh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and sometimes i try and make it last longer by counting seconds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i too have a minute snooze so i end up getting out of bed at weird times like after three snoozes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i fall back asleep instantly and usually sleep better in those ten minute bursts than i do all night on top of that i have some crazy ass minute dreams sometimes im able to hit snooze and fall back into the same dream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i often think that i should just have alarm instead of but i will cut out minutes of actual sleep trying to wake up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill never understand you snooze people i had a roommate that no lie once hit snooze freaking times i counted because it was so absurdly ridiculous if you would just learn to get up when your alarm goes off you would get more sleep and wouldnt need to hit snooze in the first place logic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,such is life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just pass the hell out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought snoozes were all minutes or is that just iphones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,us snooze people dont know how to learn to get up ive tried unsuccessfully many times it always ends up with me being late because i dont have the second alarm waking me up again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,two times seems reasonable its the five and up bunch i really dont get
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in america we are always awesome son
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea these days it seems like the flag is always at half mast
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell that to the orlando victims
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not sure if i should upvote or downvote
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its tasty but also i like colors in my cereal oddly makes it more fun to eat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoever removed the prononciation of the b in subtle is whom you can thank
Showerthoughts,not_removed,real gs move in silence like lasagna
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a subtle b
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so was the guy who put the b in obvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont get it god im terrible with english
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this person isnt even subtle about his anger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cry more im collecting salty tears from all over the reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why so mad mr douche
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the pronounciation of the b in the word subtle is subtle you basically ignore it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and youre not funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why are you so mad that i didnt find youre unoriginal shitty post interesting calm down or fuck off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks for the reply and for showing you have the inability to distinguish emotions through text im going to guess you have severe autism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes a little funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cyka blyat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he is so funny and he is making you look like a fool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just a little more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the problem with reddit is that you cucks settle for the mediocre hes just not funny that was the most basic pun to come to mind its just boring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that not relevant or funny gotta get your precious meme phrases in though because this is le reddit xd right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no he isnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and hes still mad these replies are getting easy to get though thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alright kevin hart gimme some grade a
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im just imagining you as an incredibly angry russian i really dont see why youre so hostile to everyone though just calm down
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah you showed him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are correct and i take back my earlier assertion you are making yourself look like a fool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someones mad im right it seems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course reddit would go for the meme comedian of no jokes you dont like this bad joke like we do so now you must prove youre a comedian do you go around asking film critics to make movies too i bet youre a fedora wearing atheist as well scum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit theres no need for racism here calm the fuck down kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jesus saves you heathen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,k
Showerthoughts,not_removed,k oh the sign of an angry passive aggressive child with no thoughtful response desperately trying to back out i win delicious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are fantastic im being serious good on ye
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks somebody has to take a stand against the degeneracy present on this shit website
Showerthoughts,not_removed,america thanks you for taking a stance against the communists terrorists and feminazis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would i care what a bunch of fat fucks with no sense of humour think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your either with america or your with the terrorists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,god of creating shitty games
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and u r a robot walking in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about the vending machines inside the stores the bathrooms in them employees
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes some care about aesthetics look at desktop mods
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really in he most recent bond movie instead of the super spy car havin a fancy interface it just had a bunch of simple switches that seemed to just be tacked on to the cars controls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,surprisingly easy if it doesnt have to be functional i can make a reaally nice looking ui in a day or in c or javafx
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is agile for you deliver a really great set of demos make the purpose so complex that the users cant tell if they are working or not go on holiday for months tell the customer it is finished
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if im going to be making a program that helps james bond saves the world its going to be one sweetass program
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is similar to the movie the martian that just recently came out in the behind the scenes clips the actors commented on the level of detail all the way down to mission control having legitimate notes and papers on the desks pertaining to that sections field ie navigation mechanics i dont know just space shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe that was a great scene
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a great scene that leaves a lasting impression
Showerthoughts,not_removed,looks at data god damn i turn into some sick freak
Showerthoughts,not_removed,be careful otherwise youll go back in time with a formatted drive that no device of that era can read
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what a waste of time travel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you want to save on your bulls just set up a local caching proxy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with one year difference id plan ahead if i hadnt have i wouldnt have the data ready to clone onto a drive to give to my past self
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how far back are you planning to go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry title unclear meant to be a yearly task
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah now i get it this way you could avoid any buffering delays etc i thought you were going back years or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in europe its a reality since the seventies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah in the uk there is a lot of petrol stations that have pay at pump
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ampm has kiosks at the pumps for both card and cash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in if someone doesnt have a debit card i would assume they just enjoy handing over feces and cocaine sprinkled bills face to face why ruin that for them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i seriously dont understand how this isnt already a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if only debit cards existed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is awesome not here in the states waited in line minutes today just to say ill have on pump im like why the hell isnt the pump designed like a soda machine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but we dont have a coin operated pump we have to use those stoopid plastic socalled bank cards coinop petrol pumps would be far more inefficient
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a godsend until the card reader is out of order meaning i actually have to interact with someone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not saying you cant pay with a bank card i do that alot of the time but sometimes i have alot of cash on me mostly from tips at work and im just tryin to get some gas and be on my way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an american colleague once told me its because theres a federal law that prohibits people from pumping their own gas or something is that true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they had this at sheetz by my house but they removed them probably some kind of shrinkage risk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,very true i heard they were the mark of the beast as well better stick to cash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only a few states prohibit self pumping oregon and new jersey i think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it isnt true we have self serve gas stations here just none that accept cash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even addicts struggle with steady supply oh do they struggle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hoping this is s if not do a little research yourself to see how many people are effected
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well why dont we leave every addiction alone its only killing the addicts whats the big deal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some of the most sincere humble decent people youd ever want to meet are addicted to opioids for one reason or another if you dont want to get involved in helping thats fine but to write off the entire drug addict population is stupid these people need help if theyre willing to accept it just like anyone else suffering from a disease
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does s mean opinion if so yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why does addiction suddenly pop up painkillers are used for one reason and then there are those who abuse them or parents leaving them out and kids getting at em apples and oranges
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pain killers are used for more than one reason people die from abusing them recreationally and from getting addicted and over using them im not sure what the point of your post is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pain killers should only be used for pain if you use them recreationally then thats your own judgment call the point of this post is simple people rely on them for pain others are using them trafficking them and ruining it for everyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you talk like its only people using them recklessly that causes deaths when they are also being prescribed recklessly by doctors all over the country addiction isnt just caused by recreational use
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nothing because jesus wasnt aborted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i am not mistaken i believe you can acquire stem cells from the placenta as well and if you truly believe in jesus shouldnt the answer be all of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no he is the son of god but chopping him up would have been a huge waste
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called a penis not an ego
Showerthoughts,not_removed,she can call it whatever she wants just keep stroking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my apartment complex uses the heating element in the pipe i think pretty much instant hot water and it lasts forever i frigging love it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a fantastic idea even if there are more efficient heaters theres always a delay thats gotta add up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe look into a better hot water heater then mine takes less than a minute to get way too hot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my parents let the water go in a bucket and then use the water later for gardening or whatever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe its just the cold water in the pipes coming out before the hot water from the water heater makes its way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the water already is preheated in your water tank no sense in heating the water already in the pipes as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you care about saving water watch cowspiracy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stove
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah i never knew this was a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that delay of less than a minute though gallons probably every time or if its not doing everyday still adds up quite a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when you know youre poor i need to start doing this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a lot of cold wasted water though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont leave water in the pipes maybe ill wait a few seconds if it means instant hot water without wasting any
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oven
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mine is hot before it fills a gallon jug
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres always water in your pipes why do you think it comes out instantly otherwise youd have to listen to air gurgling out of your faucet for a minute before anything came out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill wait a few seconds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that makes sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i will wait a few seconds for the water to travel in the empty pipes and reach my shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how are you going to empty your pipes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that because there are more over weight people than there are drug addicts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just call it like it is if youre a fat slob then fuck you for trying to tell me otherwise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people enjoy smoking people dont enjoy being fat its like throwing salt in the wound
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so work to make being a dick about those unacceptable too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the reason for that is because noone critize them were in an endless loop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know it would be interesting to be able to see a counter on top of peoples heads that shows if the person is currently on drugs and the type of drugs that they already did kind of like death notes life counter idk just a random thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont hide behind a monitor i have no problem telling the people i care about when they need to lose weight and get healthier and its not my opinion in worried about its public policy we have ads on tv that show a little girl being told by her dog that he doesnt like it when she smokes pot after school causing her to appear visibly guilty yet if we created a commercial where an overweight little girl is eating a slice of cake her dogs says he doesnt like when he eats too much and she looks visibly guilty as a result the soccer moms of the internet would riot in the streets this despite the fact that being overweight is likely worse for you than pot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a little defensive are we being fat is unhealthy sorry but i would never call someone fat and unhealthy if it was unwarranted similarly i wouldnt tell someone that smoking drugs and excessive drinking is bad for them because its well known that those things are bad for you just like being fat is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill grant you smoking but people most certainly do not enjoy being alcoholics or being addicted to methamphetamines yet those are some of the worst stigmas we have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what op is saying it is unacceptable to be a dick about it even though it has bad health sideeffects
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but being fat is an insecurity to most people enjoy doing drugs and drinking besides kids get bullied in school for being fat and it really breaks people down alcoholics abused something they couldvr gone their life without
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no no what im saying is make it unacceptable to criticize people for smoking drinking or doing drugs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if individuals were left completely to their own devices without any societal pressures than society would crumble overnight social stigmas and pressures evolved for a reason
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant speak as a primary source on drugs but my mother is an alcoholic when i was younger and still living at home she would get blackout drunk and pass out naked on the floor be unable to feed us not take us to school the next morning etc then the next day she would promise profusely that shell never do that again wash rinse repeat my point is alcoholics do not typically enjoy the alcoholism once sober but they always go back to the bottle eventually its an addiction also as far as fat kids getting bullied in schools thats the fault of the parents and if the parents arent providing a diet and lifestyle that is healthy for the child then perhaps they shouldnt be parents
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh full on the situation i get you now thanks for clarifying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no problem yeah even if i dont think its the best option i often like to present the alternative equalization when someones bringing up something unequal and expressing a view of equalizing it the op assumes that since those are considered ok that another thing should be okay but theres no reason not to also consider the inverse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unnecessarily rude really telling you that you need to do something to live longer and enjoy more of your life is rude i understand indulging in a gourmet dessert every now and again but being obese and claiming your are hurting my feeling you are in the wrong make you look like an idiot your claims about emotions and feelings are trivial when it comes to hard fact i agree with op we had the goddamn war on drugs but if the government tries to implement things to have a healthier diet for people they riot honestly learn that you being fat and not doing anything is not going to help you in the long run ive gotten a bit pudgy recently and i know that as such ive been working out a bit to lose some weight because i know its not healthy you even mentioned that you know the health risks but claim that they mean nothing because it hurts that poor fragile ego of yours that says you are right on everything how about you open your eyes and realize that the fa movement is garbage and no one likes it nearly everyone know that being fat is unhealthy but if you say a word about it you get criticized for trying to have people acknowledge what they are doing is not going to help them or improve them as a person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would argue that we should be discouraging detrimental behaviours i dont want the government involved thats why i was against the soda ban in ny but social stigmas have been a very effective means of controlling people throughout history were social animals and we typically want others acceptance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah since you didnt actually pay attention to the overall theme of what i was saying and instead responded only to a couple bits that bothered you and basically just read what you wanted to read i have no other response to you than this enjoy being so bitter that you feel the burning desire to accost people online about things that dont actually affect you im sure it will get you far in life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,darn fix your grammar and post again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could just not google it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or not watch it and google instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can still have a life in prison just probably not a very good one and because youre still alive laws change new evidence surfaces and there is still the possibility of getting out once youre dead youre dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right can somebody clear something up wouldnt a death sentence be less painful than life imprisonment especially compared with life imprisonment without chance of getting out or is just a really morbid way of viewing it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about that woman in australia who went to prison because they thought she murdered her baby when it was actually a dingo if they had killed her before finding out she was innocent then that wouldny be good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,couldnt you just say the same thing about life outside of prison then with that logic couldnt you say that its better to kill yourself than to live also theres always the chance of new evidence etc you cant really hit ctrlz on the death penalty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i honestly dont know what your point is here im confused
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i wouldnt say out of prison is the same effect as in prison you arent free and you dont really have a choice in how you live like theres normally a strict schedule and the new evidence is a good point but like if someone committed multiple murders with no argument possible against the overwelhikimg evidence wouldnt it be a bit of an easy way out this is probably going to seem really sadistic i apologise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think they mean my point about new evidence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if you want to go sadistic surely its better for someone who has killed multiple people to rot in prison for the rest of their life than to quickly be killed themself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but i wasnt making a reference to getting the death penalty i was saying that its less painful not that it should happen if anything the opposite was being implied
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i find it hard to have empathy for any serial killermass murderer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think you read that correctly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no i didnt sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but if it were to last that long it wouldnt exactly be the last
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you spend your last of your life suffering i dont think this is worth it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is actually quite astounding to think about nearly billion people on this earth now were not there when you were born and absolutely everyone that was alive when you were born are now all dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep we were yesterday at rock concert with a lot of we thought about how in years most of the guys will be balding sitting on their couch chair and talking to their kids about the days when they were cool and hip
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what if that person has a twin who is still alive too🤔
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many times is this going to be reposted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im and i want you to know that im still goshdarn hip
Showerthoughts,not_removed,last of their kind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,goshdarn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tools i just told it back onto itself to make a little tab haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dammit tommy go get a fucking towel and clean this shit up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks captain obvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,obvious captain is obvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what im here for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agreed personal responsibility sucks so blame the guy on the flipside i always lift the seat so people dont have to sit in sprinkles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you ever watched a girl pee in the middle of the night on an infared camera i have its a beautiful thing but the thing is they are so tired they dont look before they sit they just sit if the seat is up they fall in unless you have some big badonkadonk bitches living with you just put the seat down so they dont have to make a splash in the middle of the night if you are half asleep and pee on the seat its a lot than having her dunk her bum in the waters that come edit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah why cant we just leave it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right so there shouldnt be any complaints about forgetting to put it down
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell i should start complaining about no one putting the seat up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,colors and touch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sign language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is interesting many of our thoughts arent internally expressed in words in my experience only when im reliving or imagining conversations with other people do i actually think in words ive asked people i know about this and most of them assert that they think only or mostly in words i have an intuition that thinking in words isnt the best idea personally when i think in words its usually replaying a conversation that i would have liked to go differently i shouldve said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your thoughts are entirely separate from your inner voice which narrates them sometimes you can notice that you know the end of the sentence probably the next thought too before your inner voice had actually told it to you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but isnt thinking a silent sound in your head when you think about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so they would do the same but maybe in signs or words written not spoken
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but the word narrating implies that your inner voice has sound a sound which a deaf person would not know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you read my last comment i made a mistake i thought your question was in response to one of my shower thoughts anyway no i would say a lot of my our thoughts are more intuitions than anything picture yourself outside mowing the lawn in the summer you get thirsty do you mentally state im thirsty time to get a drink in my case its more of a realization that im thirsty followed by a visualization of my kitchen sink or i may move on to the next thought about what i need to do in order to get that drink ie shut off the mower wipe my feet etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but that narration isnt your thoughts it just reiterates your thoughts in words your thoughts have no words no language they are just thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends what you consider an era
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the scientific definition
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the screenwriters probably werent considering that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you accounting for fanboys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a straw doesnt suck on itself tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but do we really have to question the rules
Showerthoughts,not_removed,better than the rules in pythons bruce sketch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the first rule of apathy club is dont join
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or can we even
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mind blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this example means shit to me also this example doesnt mean shit to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,size of your hand so its a small spider then just use a shoe to kill it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh fuck it disappeared
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would do the same tbh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why i shower armed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hope for your sake this didnt actually happen in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so did the spider eat the op yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well now its definitely not safe in there i say you leave home and call an exterminator
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel absolutely silly being a grown man and all but fuck this thing is huge or was huge it disappeared
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope but it could since i havent caught him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,currently hiding at work im calling in a favor from the president to drone strike my house
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unfortunately any such place is closed and i have nowhere else to go i wish i had that exterminator swat team from family guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont you have a huge book or something to throw at him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id recommend keeping a loaded gun by the towels just in case
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont want to bother the neighbors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont kill a fly with a cannon but you can kill a spider with a gun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why othello
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so is your moms phone number want to save me some time and give it to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not necessarily there is no proof that pi is a normal number for now which would make that true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck your repost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,weekly repost here we come
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who does the certification
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reddit has millions of viewers reddiquette says not to complain about them reddits millions of viewers cant simultaneously keep track of every post so if theyre spaced out by a fair amount of time months and above then i dont see an issue a repost should be flattery to the original source of the content meaning it was so good that a user risks an onslaught of hateful users just to share content to a new audience reposts are good viewing content is what reddit is about viewing good content is the point of the voting system some people havent seen this yet i know i havent and ive been here for years so please dont ruin it for other redditors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the first rule is all content must be original what you posted isnt and it isnt spaced out by a fair amount of time someone posts this every other day search for ketchup smoothie and look at all the matches
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you try google it to see how often it is meant to be original content chances are you saw it days ago when it was posted and was like thatll get me upvotes roflcopter lulz
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would just increase maximum capacity so you dont get any extra energy plus if this outside the batery energy storage works we will not need to use bataries in the first place why would we we could just say that all energy is over limit and for future use
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt this just mean your battery charge meter was wrong i mean if a bottle says it can hold liter and i am able to pour liters into it the label was wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is hysterical bravo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i eont andwe phine then just kbocjbijb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeaaaaaaaaa ok ill take your word for it buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plus theres always an arquillian battle cruiser or a corillian death ray or an intergalactic plague that is about to wipe out all life on this miserable little planet and the only way these people can get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or a split second away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk about you but i dont use a tie to hold up my shirt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,belts are waist ties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my shoulders
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that possible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doing it right now man i can assure you its possible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre gonna revolutionize the clothing industry now we just need the perfect spokesman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in possible inpossible you do know it is impossible right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats just every year im pretty sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its just the sheer number of people dying though its depressing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bullshit siamese and himalayan breeds cost a shitload of money just to name two
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea actually people do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think thats accurate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where do you live most grandparents were born after the car was common there are very few people in the western world who have walked further than they have ridden
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe not yours but mine definetly did
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like the high five between the guards who just decided to go drink and eat instead of keeping an eye on the archduke franz ferdinand the day he was assassinated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this actually made me laugh so true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats better than two boobs boobs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about an image of tile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i once tiled peanut butter as my background as a joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure most of their money is plastic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no rich people have investments fat and various properties that they save for real money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,digital
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plastic ie creditdebit cards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably dont want pee on your floor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it isnt as easy as it sounds source tried it butt naked at the lake once never again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the shower i pee and walk around because my shampoo and body wash are at the opposite end of the shower from the shower head
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is if they even have a concept of music
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mjerapesaja is the best music genre
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course they do where do you think dubstep came from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,show me what you got
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably genres
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if they do exist do they have war ants monkeys and humans all have wars why wouldnt they
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are probably aliens out there who organize planetary scale music competitions you should go ask them maybe theyll show you what they got
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i created an account to upvote this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are only two genres its adam and eve not oh wait
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aww man vayyporwave sick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and now human music
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dubstep rules the galaxy gasp
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder if any alien has ever jerked it to human porn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or ears
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am from sjrfedulagitk can confirm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if they are advanced enough for interplanetary travel they have probably evolved past the point of needing violence they would be intelligent enough to realize that fighting is a waste of time that would distract them from science
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the aliens from the orion belt always give points to each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or bodies faded
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i highly doubt that people thought thats what would happen when we got to space and look what happened
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck them the guys from horsehead nebula are way better and deserve it more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea but we havent made it very far into space nowhere near as far as we would need to in order to find other inhabitable planets we as humans are held back by our wars and hate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what makes it so scary even for people who want it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go on a trip on magic mushroom and see a new color
Showerthoughts,not_removed,terry pratchett nailed it with octarine a fluorescent greenishyellow purple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably not true see httpsenwikipediaorgwikiimpossiblecolor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,perhaps the person who wrote this meant primary colors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you work in the revengeporn industry everything is sfw except for forgiveness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about gore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i really doubt so remember rule i dont really think your boss would appreciate it if you were caught watching scathological sadomasochist lolitacomplex porn unless he is a pedo or something just sayin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im beginning to resent all holidays
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a new retail worker my attitude switched around towards black friday hoo boy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt this what linkedin is about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not safe for irl interaction
Showerthoughts,not_removed,side note do prostitutes have linkedin accounts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,remindme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i f my brother because it feels good george r r martin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people do this a lot take most of the quotes attributed to oscar wilde you cant be sure if he actually meant them bc theyre coming from super morally ambiguous characters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just do it where you are better out than in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats wrong with the classic fake cough and let it rip method served me well all my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its in the amendment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i work at walmart so i let them fly and just pass the blame on the customers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,problem is i fart way louder than i cough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i guess the compressions and rarfactions of sound waves touch the eardrum and light hits the retina smell particles touch sensory cells ditto taste hmmmm coolest shower thought ive read well done good sir
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes sense it sounds weird when i say hm my ear drums are touching high amplitude waves at a fairly high frequency though haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like maybe you scream out during the first minutes of a movie before considering the plot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still waiting for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not to mention mambos and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chicken
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shake boogie mash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tango works if you eat terrorists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would any name for a specific dance be a verb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some religious beliefs do not allow such things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its your body so its your choice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you just cant force people to do such a thing human rights you know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why wouldnt it be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my organs are fucked from stomach acid so if they had to claim them when i died itd be a waste of time and resources its not even like im in peak physical condition so they salvage something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the biggest reasons is bodily autonomy we have to give consent even in death as to what is done with our bodies similar to a will red tape and lawsuits in the past make places like the us more concerned about it though some as youve noted religionoriented countries have their reservations against it some claim if a body isnt buried whole the spirit will forever search for their missing parts and so on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to keep the living alive sorry lil timmy your perfect match was real attached to his liver sorry you wont make it to that birthday party of yours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this a rhetorical question
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the world wouldnt end but some of the crops we grow would be much tougher to cultivate particularly fruits they would be almost impossible to grow on commercial levels
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it wouldnt end but a lot of other species would go extinct and a lot of people would face famine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no just a thought whether it really going to happen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not just some a really high percentage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you really want to know raskscience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ultra tailors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mega threads about a game you are not allowed to make posts about the game outside of this thread
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no like in a subreddit if there were a mega thread you couldnt talk about anything in another post or create another separate post relating to any information regarding the mega thread if there was a cookie mega thread you arent allowed to make a separate post topic chocolate chip cookies and you cant post cookie related content in the thread regarding cakes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your posts about this topic get geleted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right each subreddit is technically a mega thread
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i gave in now i have windows and webpages take minutes to load
Showerthoughts,not_removed,time to buy an imac then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no not really youre also not the first to think of this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have been banned from rpyongyang
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but they do they even tried to get a video mocking kim jongun removed from the internet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kim jong can stick a rocket up his ass alright
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kim jong un you suck in case you do have internet oops autocorrect i meant to say you rock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could even take it as far as making a movie about killing the great leader and they would never even find ouwaitaminnut thats not true at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really but the ones that can see them are the reason for their misery
Showerthoughts,not_removed,north koreans have bigger problems than being upset what someone has said about them on the internet i would think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whenever on the monstercat podcast and nikkita does roll call i type in all caps north korea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same with the amish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and rpingpong for good measure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck is this shit real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true but thats only the bad north koreans the ones with power
Showerthoughts,not_removed,short answer we arent sure but you see references to it all over reddit and not one really knows who is behind it also praise the glorious leader
Showerthoughts,not_removed,grorious reader ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because its not lubricated part of chewing is just distributing saliva to begin the digestive process
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if there is a a real person onscreen its live action for now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre not wrong but did you see the jungle book that was amazing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup big debate about this when it comes to categorizing animated movies for the academy awards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i kinda miss the old style of animation honestly and another thing whyd they have to get rid of the steamboat willy opening
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive got a friend who is working on the animation for the new beauty and the beast and apparently they are trying their best to make it a shot for shot remake and working really hard on that should be pretty good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive got to say the kids acting on the jungle book was horrible i hated it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow didnt think of that but thats a really good point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course animated films appeal to disneys core market but famous actors appeal to one of their major secondary markets middle aged women an animated film with a few liveaction shots of a semifamous actress reaches both target demos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,walle had a scene with real people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cough cough disney shill cough cough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,many in the animation community feel the same way actually and if you havent seen song of the sea yet i suggest you do delightfully magical and presents gaelic folklore with a journey in a way that brave failed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,steamboat willy opening is still in all disney animation studios films it was in zootopia and yes moana should be traditionally animated i agree that zootopia wouldnt work as a movie but moana was born to be a traditional disney movie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe that because the teaser was legit a shot for shot remake of the original teaser
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant wait to see the character designs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,really i thought he was much better than most shitty cringey child actors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,howso hes a kid he acted like a kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought he did pretty good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean it wasnt the greatest but hes just a kid and hes acting to a green screen the entire film you gotta give him some credit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kill bill had a scene with animation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder how many papers had to be signed to film that scene alone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that the putty patrol in the background
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh it is i thought i saw it missing from a few maybe im just crazy haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i really hope its a musical
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they are apparently pretty great not allowed to see it yet but my friend has watched it mostly start to finish now at the studio and he was happy with it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cough cough child anakin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,best kid actress up to now was that girl in the fall tarsem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he acted awkward and cringey just like actual kids are mostly and not like a screen kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you got your chocolate in my peanut butter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,about threefiddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were all crazy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont see how they possibly could ruin it and not make it a musical
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets be fair that was like lucas fault mcgregor is a good actor and he was basically reading pornlevel dialogue by the end
Showerthoughts,not_removed,keep in mind that he was acting alone in a green screen taking cues from the director to say his lines
Showerthoughts,not_removed,best return does not mean best possible movie its a business art is an afterthought unless youre an auteur
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you got your peanut butter in my chocolate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i get so sick of people complaining about how hayden christensen is a bad actor no one calls natalie portman or liam neeson bad actors but the performances they gave were sincerely baaaad you can literally watch the behind the scenes footage and see george lucas directing actors to be wooden and robotic it is some the worst acting direction by a professional i have ever seen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a business of selling art we shouldnt buy a ticket because its a business and were supposed to we should and do buy tickets because its a movie and i want to enjoy it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i completely agree you can only give so much of a performance when the direction is batshit crazy and the script is awful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey thats not entirely true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey go fuck yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the baby on board sticker is for paramedics and first responders in the event of an accident to help them prioritize their scene management
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the sticker is there to tell you the people in there are operating on a lot less sleep its there so that you the other drivers know to be careful of that vehicle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i saw this post and rushed in here to say exactly what you said lol glad someone else knows i just had a kid and our suv has one of those and ive had to inform several people who decided to make the jokes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then it should be required to be removed when the child is absent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,give me a break parents do not get a pass to drive while inadequately alert
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i did that too im beginning to think its just common knowledge
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the sticker is there to help inform responders of the potential should a diabetic take off their medical alert bracelet when they arent having a diabetic attack of course not they might be unconscious and having an incident completely unrelated to diabetes angina seizure etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am not saying it is right or legal or whatever im just telling you what the purpose of the sign is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not common enough evidently lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if its there to help notify first responders of a potential child and the sticker is in the window with an empty car seat in the car will the first responders waste time looking for the child what if by looking for a non existent child for even a few minutes they are unable to save someone else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really most picture books are simple and dont leave much room for interpretation because they are aimed for little kids plus they only have like a few words on them compared to long page books you could also argue that some books are used as artistic expressions and are open to interpretation just as much as a picture is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what subreddits i just want to know do i can subscribe to them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think that maybe unlikely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you might be the king of lurkers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm i live paycheck to paycheck off payday loans and overdrafts and am still trying to save up for a retainer for my inevitable bust
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the best answer to time travel especially since matter cannot be added ie versions of you is the multiverse ala a show like sliders and we have plenty of good evidence for it actually being the case too like how weak gravity is gravity should be way stronger than it actually is but it may not actually be here rather just leaking from another very close universe anyway you could then time travel kill grandpa and all that shit with no repercussions as he isnt your grandfather but instead the grandfather of another timeline universe it solves all of the paradoxes because you dont go to your own just close ones further ahead or behind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a serious fear of the percent chance that on the first day of a college class they will have everyone go around in a circle and talk about themselves at which point i am always torn between making up a ridiculous story trying to hyper focus and actually pull out the greatest highlights of my entire life and make it look like i am nearly a normal human being or just lazily telling the truth hi my name is jack i play videogames and watch netflix
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt even know what to say hi im bob and im a human i do all kinds of things and right now im talking in front of you all have a nice day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought i was the only one who made myself gag using that damn tongue cleaner on the back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,future generations wont have a gag reflex once they convince us that we have to clean our palatine uvula twice a day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ac vs dc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,confirmed electricity is our god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the actual shower thoughts are always great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ohhh a literal shower thought i see what you did there op thats not something ive been conditioned to see on reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i ran out of face wash i stole my fhs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyve become posted more often lately
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shower observations rule reported
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmm good one i wonder who named it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but if youre not rocking out to queens bohemian rhapsody youve got to no soul
Showerthoughts,not_removed,computers and smartphones but doing some breathing excersices makes sleep faster as majority have stress so here problem is not in computer it is in stress
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when steve bannon takes a shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you cant pretend like it didnt happen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the industry focused in making ghosts appear real will start to lobby against cameras for perfect video
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true i feel like with cgi and practical effects getting better and better each day everyday video can easily be manipulated so we will no longer distinguish truth from reality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because you step out of the kitchen and see friends is on and its the one where everyone finds out that monica and chandler are dating and you see phoebes reaction and its gosh darn hilarious and as the events unfold it goes to commercial break and you realize its been minutes and you left water boiling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cause you watched it too long
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no the sequel meant now you see me too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,puppies are dogs dogs are dinguses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to have the same thoughts about my neighbor he was an old man but always driving around to pass time if his car didnt move for a few days i wondered if i should check to see if he had fallen and couldnt get up turns out he just runs out of gas money before his next check
Showerthoughts,not_removed,honestly you should look in the windows to see if someone is dead as hell in the back seat seriously this kind of thing has happened
Showerthoughts,not_removed,parking garage thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my husband repairs antique clocks and i have the same thoughts about his customers sometimes since a lot of them are up there in years hubs will remark that this person or that person hasnt come to pick up their clock after he left them messages fingers crossed that it never happens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe gta not fallout
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you sure because i been playing gta iv right now and the vibe keep playing neyo because of you over and over again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but everyone single song from fallout is actually fucking wonderful not a single song of these pop radios is good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are more fallout games than the number of songs in any single fallout game three dog is the best dj though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was in a buiness technology course where the girls dominated the radio so obviously we got the syndicated pop station not popstation i would go on mental tirades about how they play the same stuff over and over so i did a tally in excel found out that they werent playing the same song over and over it was about songs that i hated that sound identical playing over and over
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yippee yay therell be no wedding bells for today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people play these games for more time straight than they listen to the radio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more songs i can stand to listen to and less annoying djs anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,come on man you know you got that uranium fever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gta sure fallout oh no no no no no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not every new vegas song is good my johnny is the most annoying fucking thing on earth though all the others are pretty good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i got spurs that jingle jangle jingle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bingo bango bongo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure is there was never a song like my johnny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill have you know johnny guitar is the best song in all of the mojave wasteland
Showerthoughts,not_removed,emglish b hard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think your fact was true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay then say that instead of an ambiguous question
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your statement was blatently wrong fallout has over songs i thought my questioning of it should have stood out sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there you go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,happy personal new year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was frequently told at my first construction job the best part of you ran down the inside of your mothers thigh not sure how relevant this is but here you go ps if youre dad had masturbated one more time youd be stuck to the inside of a gym sock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your mother shouldve swallowed you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or been swallowed by some random dude at the gym
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op should spend more time masturbating and less time reposting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or smear you all over her tits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre lucky only his mind was blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and every penis you hold needs a shake
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and this was a repost nice try that was about mins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the circle of life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,back in the day people only had access to a few sources of information they didnt know how ignorant they were if the local paper didnt report a massacre two states over how would you find out today we can see how other folks ignore whats going on moreover ignorance isnt really a detriment to reproduction or even living how many farmers actually understand the nitrogen cycle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my walkman never had a speaker
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well the jokes would have to be killer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is a terrible analogy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no we believe it cause the math works out of airplanes and ships would get lost and crash if we didnt account for the curvature of the earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,deleted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one must always consider the source reputable established scientific organisations support a round earth youtube conspiracy theorists support a flat earth the logic is not the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we actually have other but if you want to use this argument then the same could be said about any scientific fact i dont believe something just because i readsawheard it i do a bit of research check for bias in sources and look for actual significant evidence before i believe something i also love researching and learning new things so its not something id expect everyone to do it doesnt change the fact that they are wrong and they are spreading false information looking at it this way though maybe people would show a bit more understanding it doesnt help anyone when we just yell at people for being wrong ask them where they got the information from and go from there explain why they shouldnt trust some sources education is key
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were all part of many peoples plans at any given moment even if we have our own as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,religion believes that god was just here but believing that the universe was just here is not religious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like i should fully expect to see this in a fortune cookie someday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry bud but yourent correct on this one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre insistent on internal consistency in the english language its going to be a long day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aint that a bitch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so what if we somehow found a way to stay put and no longer orbit the sun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thatsexactly what it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont let the flat earth knuckleheads hear you say that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless you are bean the stick is the carrot the carrot is an even better carrot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,virginity is a fake concept there is no way to prove someone is or is not a virgin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is a concept but there is nothing fake about the concept its just a title
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about a girls hymen if shes w the right guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the hymen is a ring not a thing you break when having sex for the first time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hymen can break with exercise some sexually active girls have intact hymen it is around the opening it does not cover the opening because where will the period blood go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always been confused about it why does it feel like a wall then and why does it hurt so bad the first time and why is there bleeding i could google all of this but i wont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre gonna get us rebooted op cut that shit out ive been programmed to like my simulated life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,beep boop bop beep space versus tabs beep bop beep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sign language seriously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was posted less than an hour ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow rude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,great im still a part of a minority
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmmmm raptor ponders yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bite me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe like vulcan they are waiting for us to develop a warp drive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the answer to that question really doesnt matter whether you brush your teeth or not your dentist is still gonna scrap food particles from your teeth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first time i ever wished for a character limit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except the shape and colour of the laptop is so easily recognizable its hard not to think of the apple and wonder why even cover it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly thats my point it is so unique as a laptop that it s funny that they cover it in order to avoid any hidden advertising policy issue they are legally compliant but from a marketingadvertising point of view they are totally sponsoring it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would relieve some of the anxiety but i would still never believe their extent capabilities at this point its too late for the concept of privacy to even be a thing anymore hi nsa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where are you from all i know is make sure they dont die or you get in trouble
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre not prepared to punch nuts or be punched in the nuts you shouldnt be fighting shouldnt be fighting anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if there is even a tiny chance that i might not win be prepared to be twisted up into knots there is no honor among thieves the same can ve said for hand to hand combatants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think that is the same rule
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go to rehab
Showerthoughts,not_removed,umm go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see an ophthalmologist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id be like thats weird why is that guy asking himself hypothetical questions while in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not red or yellow so im going
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id see the location of the purple light and which light it was supposed to be then do what it was supposed to be like go if it originally wouldve been green or stop if red
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reverse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id kiss the sky
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mission failed snake snake snaaaaaaaaaaaaakee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,headshots kd people killed accuracy na
Showerthoughts,not_removed,score retry in seconds wait why zero instructions pleeeeease game restarted crying congratulations its s baby boy crying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,masturbated times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shoot maybe i dont want to see my stats see how half lived my life is haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we never had a chance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,had sex times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,backwards dream i once dozed off during a movie that id seen many times had what felt like a very long dream would have guessed mins opened my eyes to the same scene maybe lines ahead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dreams that seem like hours really only last fractions of a second if you are over sleeping try hitting the actual snooze button on your alarm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do this too but until i know the gender of the poster i have this weird androgynous voice in my head weirds me out sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hah whos pro choice now vegans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes you moron
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol what happened
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i said wouldnt the fruit be the baby reasoning because a fetus is actually inside the womb still developing the baby is already separated from the mother
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well the sapling would be the baby which comes out of the fruit and grows into the full grown tree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,best is a challenge you know you can overcome im looking at you mr monday crossword
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its easy to say for doors because you either need them or you dont there is no oh yeah an extra door doesnt hurt but i dont think thats the purpose of commercials the purpose is so that the brand sticks in your mind for the time you need such thing even for something like febreze if you know what it is you never see the commercial and say yeah i feel my house smells let me go and buy one but rather the time you feel you need fresh scent you think what you can do and the first thing that comes to your mind is febreze
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre telling me youve never been cuckoo for cocoa puffs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i see ads for movies or games i get hyped and sometimes spend money just not sponges and shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve obviously never seen a commercial for kitkats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,those days are coming to an end but i remember i had a great aunt that would literally say that to every infomercial back in the
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i got sprayed by a skunk when i was a kid point blank right in the gabber it was dark and i thought that rustling in the garbage cans beside me was one of the neighborhood stray cats looking for a late night snack of course my fool ass reached to pet it and got the olfactory surprise of a life time i tried everything including febreeze everything just ended up smelling like a skunk had just rode a few turns in the dryer and to this day i cannot stomach the smell of that stuff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,totally the same shit that got me jacked up as a kid still gets me jacked up as an adult
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow thats tough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,coming from a country with no skunks care to try and explain the smell i know that can be like describing a colour but dammit do your best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre not all the same the base smell of some skunks is akin to old rancid garlic others have more of a burnt tire thing going on more specifically though its not so much the smell as it is chemical warfare if youre just smelling one from some distance as you drive down a country road its mildly like putrifaction but just a minor annoyance up close and especially on you its got the same ability to abuse mucous membranes as ammonia it burns and knocks the air out of your lungs shits unreal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you probably could learn to drive quite well like that actually and itd probably be a bit safer no blind spots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by knowing that number isnt real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would be more of an issue if three quarters of notes had traces of dog biscuits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shit movie if i ever saw one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats fine but youre an asshole and you should know that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill watch porn with your girlfriend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,watch porn with your girlfriend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a girl who watched porn and would try things she saw it was great until she spit in my mouth and punch me in the face still worth it though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bad news dude she already has grow up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what why on gods green earth would you be angry i wish my girlfriend watched porn on second thought i wish i had a girlfriend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you might be missing out on a whole new level of sexual possibilities between you and your girl but then again you might not be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive just finished watching porn with his mum i guess id watch it with his girlfriend next
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are a douchebag
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like youre young and not experienced
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow this is crazy to me that someone could be that afraid of talking to other humans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its ok i dont know what i yam either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well it could be worse atleast youre not this guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i yam what i yam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,caillou is a despicable spineless boy who cannot do anything he cant grow hair not because he has cancer or progeria but because he sucks and even his own body recognizes that he does not deserve hair or food or love he has a baby sister who dominates his life because she is a normal loving child who does not whine about the slightest fart of the breeze caillous parents love her better because she is a better person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought it was a sweet potatoe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the yam are the powers that be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a fucking sweet potato you turd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dipshit deserves to get dumped
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im making it an effort to go as long as i can in my life without knowing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a sweet potatoe is that like a potato that has toes or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,coomera is sweet potato
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol auto correct spelled potatoes i took the s off mustve forgot the e oops
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no you can be sentenced to jail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i prefer the pixelation when negotiating crowds means no accidental eye contact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,much like a bush
Showerthoughts,not_removed,waste of money due to terrific marketing buy a pc for of the price use it for yrs wipe it like with a towel and use it for linux
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youll struggle to buy a house for £ in the uk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,talking total or down payment only
Showerthoughts,not_removed,total taking as the down payment required in of cases in the uk even at youre still looking at a total price of £ in a country where the average house price is £ which includes london which skews the figures
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or else its because a day goes by around times faster than a month or times faster than a year just my
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or even more likely op has no idea what most people do or do not remember and is talking out of his ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because evolution is not instantaneous
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except all the ones that do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,precisely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone posts a video and people say stuff about it did anybody ask
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would argue you did if you posted it on a site like reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really basic deduction the first baby born to a human instinctively went for the tit then through basic observation man realized theres something coming out of there then put two and two together women have tits milk comes out of so milk must come out of a cows tits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who was the first one to try cows milk is the new what is up with airplane food
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this makes me uncomfortable to drink the milk brand creamoland
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or you know a farmer with eyeballs and a brain that saw a suckling calf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but we make milkand if you were near cows you would see the calf doing the same thing whats more impressive is all the shit weve made out of milk who the hell thought adding kelp to ice cream would make it better i dont know why they did it but the good ice creams always have kelp in them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or they were just thirsty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,elementry my dear ryios
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no leave it thats too much for ops brain to handle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most people fear the responsibility of leadership and are willing to make concessions when somebody else takes it on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats kind of common throughout all of sports though efficiency less swings at bat is better than a strike out less plays down the football field to touchdown is better than constantly trying for down conversion fewer bounces of a tennis ball before striking it shorter period of time in a race means you win come to think of it if you play just about any sport less than youre opponent in a match youre likely winning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,golf is a good walk spoiled mark twain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i remember a post about this like a year ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats very true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,robin williams fan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good points maybe not any sport but most certainly a lot of sports sports like diving gymnastics figure skating extreme sports eg snowboarding youre trying to cram in as many difficult flips twists and jumps as you can in effect trying to play the most amount of that sport in a set amount of time space
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but we are referring to play here not point structure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is also true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this supposed to be in rtrees
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks i will check
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if we protest against bombing would it end if we protest against closing a way of escape would it open perhaps its easier to protest when theres more hope for success
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and youre shocked by this why did you wake up this morning and forget the track record thats been set before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,muggle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the prefix u in the word utopia is a negative prefix like un or im so in greek utopia meant the place that cannot exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,world peace does not require a uniform utopia indeed if there are people who think peace is dystopia they are welcome to their suffering
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes it can you arent thinking far enough a utopia will never exist as long as humans are flawed an utopia is a society where technology is advanced enough to the point where genetic engineering has made humans near perfect in a perfect society everyone helps each other and everyone works together towards the same productive goal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think peace is only possible if we allow ourselves to understand each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can show peace is possible just make me the leader of the free world and i send you to nice little work camp that will provide all your needs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why we cant ever have world peace all we can do is to make the wars less physical and think that something great is achieved and later wonder how all attempts fell short humans arent even always at internal consonance except in fundamentalism peace is an unachievable goal until something powerful intervenes and we dare not resist but i ask are you willing to call a destroyed country as peaceful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if there are less than two people in the world this problem ceases to exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why i decided years ago to stop trying to figure out what is right and instead just try to make the most number of people possible happy you can never please everyone but you can get damn close if you try
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dad always told me that as long as someone wants something bad enough to kill for it world peace is impossible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why the foundation of peace is never utopia peace is built on making a world thats good enough that everyone in it prefers to accept it than fight thats where ideas like free trade agreements come from henry kissinger came up with it interconnected economies suffer more from war so by decreasing the value of war we increase tolerance for tolerance and are willing to quietly accept tension in the south china sea rather than seek a more perfect solution
Showerthoughts,not_removed,world peace will never happen because nobody wants to fuckin share
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks zenyatta
Showerthoughts,not_removed,world peace will happen when all the humans are dead or become robots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a feminists utopia is a man dystopia ftfy in much the same way a nazis utopia is a jews dystopia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nowhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why the correct spelling is eutopia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the problem is it doesnt require uniform utopia only in theory in reality you will always have people who want to make others happy by destroying what they perceive as dystopia and people who are afraid that their own utopia will be destroyed by others hence wars edit spelling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can think of plenty ways in which peace could be worse than war im sure you can too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the idea of being genetically engineered in how to think sounds like my kind of dystopia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so insects hivemind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a perfect society everyone helps each other and everyone works together towards the same productive goal sounds like a dystopia to randians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who decides what that goal is what i want to work towards a different goal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha christ that post history
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but that implies europe is perfect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a wise man once said some men just want to watch the world burn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like to view wars as natures smart way of managing human population its not as effective as say a volcanic winter ice ages and the like but theyre instantaneous on geological scale and can wipe out a completely arbitrary number of people no need to brutforce let us do the dirty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it wont sound like that to anybody when it happens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cough brave new world cough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,women must love him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no just a really good rope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how do you define world peace though is it no nations warring with each other or absolutely no crimemurder because there being madmen doesnt necessarily lead to war if those people are not in positions of political or military power
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ironically that mans utopia would mean colonization of a poorer people and looting and destruction of their country and his country getting richer at their wealth fucking alfred and his british empire bullshit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn dude you are super deep and edgy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not the worst suicide plan ive come up with
Showerthoughts,not_removed,elementary my dear huxley
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my wife loves me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are you talking about you crazy person clearly it is a sideways nutsack
Showerthoughts,not_removed,funny because the heart symbol looks more a woman bending over than a heart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are you talking about you crazy person clearly it is a number less than
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many balls are in a nutsack
Showerthoughts,not_removed,less than
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly were both right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the real lpt is always in the comments
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was coined in the by the film industry i think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes only an animal would watch the commercials
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely yes so tired of being considered an idiot that will purchase anything and everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just assumed this was standard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,department of pyromaniacs sounds like a cult
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the dousing department would be better in the book fahrenheit the firemen did start fires they burned books
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why they dont let me volunteer anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsyoutubezegjlhzmim
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish i had a girlfriend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its scary to think that were just living beings on a giant ball floating in the middle of nowhere at a tremendous speed my point is like op said were all insignificant little shits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the earth is flat and god has a divine plan for us all but we have to make it past the giant antarctic shelf to discover the pot of gold left by maroni
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean not really
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt it our imagination that enables us to place ourselves in the past the only information that we have is what we have perceived and i think our imagination fills in a lot of blanks i think thats why people will have conflicting memories of the same event
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets confuse everyone by introducing the martian system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpstarecatcomcontentwpcontentuploadsspaceinmetricsystemspaceinimperialsystemjpg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,while were at it swipe the card or insert the chip
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do they call a quarter pounder with cheese on mars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well since theres no way anyone will get there using the imperial system im pretty sure itll be metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,deleted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric imperial system is slowly being factored out anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well as far as we know there are no natives we can enslave so metric it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doesnt matter mars will be monopolized by the wongs come anyways
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and which side of the road to drive on when we make them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric you fucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you realize that noone in the world uses imperial its like usa and some random african country
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it will be metric because all the first people there will be scientists and engineers of one stripe or another its going to be that way for a long time starting out too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please si units im tired of american measurements oh and umm dont forget to use radians over degrees
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is quite the american sentiment to think that the imperial system is going to even be considered on mars when the only country in the world that still uses imperial is america
Showerthoughts,not_removed,since the metric system is scientific standard i guess imperial is out of question
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as an american can we please for the love of god switch to metric already
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact we already lost one mars vehicle due to the metric imperial issue
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and base
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well since we are colonizing it has to be imperial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like knowing both i use both take a foot cord make it a loop toss it on the ground clip all the grass and weigh it in grams and you can extrapolate that by multiplying it by ten to pounds per acre i like knowing how much a liter of cola is but buying my milk by the gallon a pint of beer is just right and its easy to imagine a gram coke i measure my dick by inches but my fun runs by the kilometer i buy bushels of peaches but i process soil samples by grams per centimeter i dont know why people are so divided on this embrace both and youll broaden your ability to measure and communicate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when we land on mars we need to choose the metric system or the imperial system and never introduce the other ever ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only backwater countries still use the imperial system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was at a party way out in the middle of the woods one night and after this girl had a few too many drinks she breaks down and starts crying hysterically so naturally we ask her what the problem was and she said his brother is going to die soon death is scary i get that but heres the weird part she said he signed up for a one way trip to mars to set up a communications system there and they can only provide him a one way trip we know this girls brother is a big shot in the communications field and worked on the white houses network i dont know exactly what as he said it was classified take it for what its worth from a random internet redditor but i know what i heard and she was absolutely convinced he was going into space and not comming back she is who i would consider a highly credible person with strong ties to her community and an owner of multiple bussineses tldr we already have a communication network setup on mars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as an american for the love of god can we chose metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric as an american dear god please just do metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nasa uses metric all but countries in the world use metric if imperial was used it would be the biggest facepalm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,us military uses metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we already chose the metric system over years ago its just america liberia and burma who use imperial which is funny because you dont usually think of them as having their shit together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we had once sent a mission to mars that was programmed in both the speed was in one and the distance in the other it caused the vehicle to smack the surface of mars going at full speed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when we land on mars we need to pick the metric system then never introduce imperial ever ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,implying they would even allow the metric system do you honestly think only americans are going to mars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well considering that the scientific standard is metric it will probably be metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate the imperial system why would you measure by fractions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric is better and used worldwide not just in a couple places
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reading through the comments it ought to be imperial just so reddit will have something to complain about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric if you say imperial youre part of the problem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imperial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,obviously metric as an american our country would be a simpler place if we didnt use the fucked up imperial system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the imperial system did you want death stars because thats how you get death stars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im an american and i say metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck imperial units i am still salty we didnt get the metric system it is so much easier
Showerthoughts,not_removed,use metric the maths is a lot easier imperial while very useful for humanrelevant measurements that make sense metric is the international scientific standard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not going there unless they pick metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no we need to choose the metric system not one or the other we just need to choose the metric system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the real question is how will we compensate for the weight difference because a kilo of water on mars will have more volume than a kilo of water on earth because of the gravity difference this will be annoying and dangerous when serious chemistry starts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imperial also we scratch maternity leave from the dictionary hold elections when people are working and circumcise every boy just because it will truly be an exceptional place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imperial metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also atheism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but like obviously were going with the metric system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all we need is a toggler in gui
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but as far as time zones im sticking with taco standard time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for the empire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets just use both for for redundancy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a martian nautical mile would be smaller than earths and only useful sailing thru the dune seas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the imperial system why would you do that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if gravity is different on mars would everything weight differently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even as an americanpick metric our military space program and most engineering firms use it nearly the rest of the world uses it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only problem would be you couldnt connect to earth reddit so someone would need to make mars reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like it would really be an opportunity to come up with a new measurement system ive always wondered if we could make a system thats baseindependent put a subscript indicating the base near the kilo for example so instead of being it would be the value youre measuring going to need to be divided a lot use or need units for talking about how many bitsbytes of memory youve got or
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and choose power system and outlet no preferations but lets choose 😄
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric ftw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,while metric makes much more sense i prefer imperial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imperial bastard my ancestors are smiling down on me can you say the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i honestly use both for different things and i dont mind at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can we make the viking style funeral the norm on mars maybe there isnt enough water but there is enough rocks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no you need to choose the metric system period
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually the agreed upon unit of measurement for space travel is the metric system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt look like liberia myanmar or that other weird country whose name ive forgotten will get to mars first though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the single holdout using the imperial system could just fucking grow up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everything that will get them there will be in metric so i guess thats settled
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure nasa uses the metric system and pretty much every other country on the planet uses metric so im pretty sure imperial wont make it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how about a new dozenal metric system and while were at it lets use dozenal number systems for everything and all speak one language also no countries
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both are useful metric is based on which gives us a natural abacus american is based on halves and is more beneficial for building houses metric gets fractional as well if you half ten then half that you are left with or fraction
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when we land on mars sure good idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a mechanic and when i work on cars that arent metric i jokingly think to myself fuck the guys that made this car metric is just so much easier theyre just numbers nine of this fraction bullshit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you dont decide before you go there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how dare you insert an argument where there is none literally everyone intelligent agrees metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,earth has chosen metrics already no need to to land on mars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric masterrace
Showerthoughts,not_removed,better take the opportunity to go full metric for time and calendar otherwise well have the same situation down the road
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im an american and an electrician my vote is metric i also vote we switch to metric in america metric is just easier etc divided in half inches fuck if i know give me a piece of paper and a calculator pls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first one to mars chooses d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a cm air hose and a inch air socket watney is dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,humans started to go to mars in first landing in lots of flybys and orbiters multiple rovers and orbiters there now wikipedia has a list of httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofmissionstomars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,obviously base so metric this is not a debate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,usa is the only one too stupid to do it today embarrassing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would most likely be dictated by what is available for tooling which would be most likely dictated by the standards used in the fittings fasteners and adjustments of the equipment being used that would most likely be chosen by the contractor or contractors building the equipment if it wasnt specified in the initial plans so if you really want success in that effort you need to enforce it looooooooong before you land on mars it needs to be at least a line item in the business proposals that are worked out well in advance of the building of the equipment and not allowed to drop off in between any of the negotiations that change the plans being proposed and it would probably have to be coupled with lots of reminders along the way considering a lot of manufacturing today just assumes both tooling will be reasonably available and goes with whatever standard theyre on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nasa uses metric anyway could you imagine if they tried to build intricate space parts using inches instead of millimeters or microns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why we must make sure the first country to colonise mars is not the usa burma or liberia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric for measurement fahrenheit for temperature
Showerthoughts,not_removed,honestly i say metric because in all honesty its just better and im american
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no love for planck units
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sorry americans but make it metric the rest of the world uses it and if you go into the maths and science its more precise and is based of replicateable stuff like the meter is the distance of a certain wavelength of light where the pound and inch are arbitrary and the foot if it was based of real peoples feet would be inconsistant plus nasa uses metric and so does the rest of science
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they wont work and they will mess up things even more nothing will have the same weight on the two planets so therefore we need a new system or at least martian kgpounds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,freedom loving american here metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can we also ditch both fahrenheit and celsius and just use kelvin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do but the selection is not as good and they did not have one that suited our needs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the imperial system will never be used on mars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,scientists theyll use metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,neither would transfer correctly all weights would have to be listed in newtons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and can anyone explain to me if we had a chance to start over from scratch why you would ever choose imperial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well how about just get with the program like of the planet has p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im american and i vote metric now the real problem we need a new date system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think they will actually declare anything its pretty obvious that metric is more practical
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres only two types of countries in the world those that use the metric system and those that went to the fucking moon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not even a competition metric for sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youll realize we have already fucked this up right the first attempt to land a roveron mars completely shit the bed because metric and imperial systems dont play nicely together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or use the si system it makes science easier
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i remember reading about catastrophes caused by poor conversions in engineering the imperial system shouldnt even exist and i used it almost exclusively for the first years of my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually the metric and imperial systems have both had exposure on mars from what i remember a probe was sent there and they failed to convert certain things from metric to imperial or vice versa probe either buried itself like a martian meteorite or got shot out of orbit never to be heard from again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imperial is garbage we should honestly abandon it altogether
Showerthoughts,not_removed,itll be metric everything official that happens in space is metric afaik but people will still use imperial units you wont have a bunch of americans suddenly start saying theyre tall and weigh theyre still gonna be and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,considering that itll be the us of fucking a who gets there im thinking the communist alphabet of numbers can stay behibd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric measurements based off units imperial measurements based off human body fahrenheit for example based off core body temperature if you have a fever was originally meant to be degrees celsius is based off waters boiling and freezing points degrees freezing point degrees boiling point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats this metric you speak of i dont see any country that uses metric making it to mars anytime soon america fuck yeah hope you like inches bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just use freedom units
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many countries have landed on the moon using the metric system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,freedom units thats what mars needs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,freedom units forever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no that rover isnt tons its gloops
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok here to that rock over there is a marsmile how far is it its a marsmile pay attention
Showerthoughts,not_removed,martian would just the american system with universal gravitation set to the gravitational constant of mars or use the british system and change the mass of a slug before everyone tries to correct me on calling it the american system look up slugs or british gravitational system america and the uk have a slightly different definition of how to calculate weight which generally mean the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and implement very confusing time zone rules that change depending on the seasons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they already fucked up days by calling them sols
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know we laugh about this but how much you want to bet it happens new currency new measurement system they use a random language that no one here really uses or changes english into their own itll be a mess within a generation or two
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at least with measuring time they will need to do so a martian year is earth days long but about martian days if martians want a their equivalent of a month to be about days long they will need a month calendar or month long calendar of about days per month
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no matter what it has to have a unit named a ton to complement the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiton
Showerthoughts,not_removed,technically wouldnt this be what we actually want by this i mean that we currently use the metric system which is based off of earth numbers of water is etc this is going to be very different on mars so they should build a system that would make sense in that environment just like you wouldnt use the days in a year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill take two martys of water please
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not paying smidgens for a broken defraqulator
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uhso pirateninjas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly op can take his boring system elsewhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im struggling to think of any other scenario where this image could possibly be any more relevant to the discussion than this one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,incorrect this is a much more accurate representation of metric vs the imperial system in space
Showerthoughts,not_removed,scan the retina
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a fan of tap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,neither use the nfc chip in the card much faster than either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i havent swiped my card in about years and i only insert the chip for transactions over £
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its ridiculous how worked up people get over this like i have had people have near meltdowns because i asked them to use the chip reader
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a cheese martiale
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they dont know what the fuck a quarterpound is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,finland is metric and we have the qp with cheese here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gram with cheese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a cheese decikilo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a eleven onehundredth kilogramer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mohel with cheese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably dust
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a burger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but this time the meter will be of the speed of light not of the speed of light
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely why even mention imperial like countries in the entire world use it that would be like saying the international language of mars should be english or samoan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can we please make this just the standard on earth first i live in the us and am in healthcare and we use metric and its hard for me to conceptualize how big a centimeter is or how much a ml is because its never used in my regular life and the metric system is better anyways
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would it be based on the metrics of water on mars or earth though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we lost some bolts for our daughters crib in the move so i went to home depot to get replacements turns out was a metric bolt instead of measured in inches so didnt have any that would suit our requirements what a pain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but but if we use the metric system we can no longer be the imperial empire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah dude merica
Showerthoughts,not_removed,implying they wouldnt use it or that it wouldnt be successful if they tried
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ever heard of the mattress burrower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact big parts of the apollo program were done in imperial units
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for all those time i have to figure out exactly how much energy my gallon of water will need to boil
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well compromise the middle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where were going we dont need roads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there really is no reason to use imperial other than were just used to it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,liberia and myanmar which are two countries you dont really think of having their shit together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,canada is blended and its annoying as fuck i am a carpenter by trade formwork building primarily they teach us everything in school in metric measurements we calculate everything in millimeters and meters rarely in centimeters in commercial and civil construction all of our drawings are in metric however most guys can work with metric or imperial measurements the really stupid thing is of new home building is done in imperial measurements anyone who works framing houses works in imperial we get framers who come over and dont understand the metric system and its stupid as hell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are exceptions im in the uk and people always say their height in feet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you do realize that spacex and nasa are in america right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you realize that the us has a substantial fraction of the world population edit keep downvoting its which is more than the majority of countries have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you literally contradicted yourself in one comment how can you say no one uses it and then point out the usa and possibly other countries use it the usa isnt exactly a small player on the world or interstellar stage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ugh its radians out today so fkin hot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fellow american here born and raised on the imperial system i agree we need some uniformity with our measurements if the rest of the world can agree on a system then so can we
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree except for temperatures the fahrenheit system is superior in my eyes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the purchase orders for the mars climate orbiter program required all suppliers to use metric one supplier didnt and no one caught it that resulting in mars catching the orbiter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a programmer id be so happy if we could just use hexadecimal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imperial system keeps your fraction skills sharp
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kek
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the uk still uses some imperial measurements as does canada
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what does ftfy mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the case so far
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and even the americans would be against the imperial system though they use it now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah mass is used in the calculations not weight if you want to measure mass use a beam balance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is incorrect a kilo is a measure of mass which is entirely independent of gravity weight on the other hand eg pounds will vary with gravity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chemistry cares more about ratios than absolute volumes so thats not the end of the world and you can just recalibrate the scales used anyway something that very precise scientific scales do anyway as earths gravitational field isnt constant over the surface
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a kilo is a kilo weight mass a kilo of lead on earth is still a kilo of lead on mars or in a kilogram of water will still be a kilogram of water on mars even if it feels lighter or expands due to atmospheric differences weight should be expressed in newtons but is not done so on earth because we dont really have to do so outside of science and the weight to mass relation is almost constant on earth mass is in kilogrammes and doesnt change
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kilogram mass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope for a couple reasons water is not compressable also youre confusing gravitation and pressure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i started of wanting to rant and ended hoping this was sacrasm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are two types of countries those that have visited the moon and soon mars and those that use the metric system and liberia and myanmar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everything in of a kilo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look it up still gross
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it can totally happen options are divide a day on mars in parts not equal to an hour use regular hours then theres more than or use some weird made up hours neither one is perfect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not in metric in metric you often see kg used as a weight of sorts its actually a mass but mostly when describing how much someone weighs no one says x newtons since kg is a unit of mass if we used metric and calibrated the scales properly there would be no problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a blend of imperial and metric got us to the moon i mean they use metric these days and its be better but the original moon landing wasnt pure metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,without celsiuskelvin the whole metric system stops making sense that being said planck units are obviously the masterrace
Showerthoughts,not_removed,starting over from scratch would imply we would still have a chance to not pick decimal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because its what americans are used to and americans will be the first people on mars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cause merica
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only reason we went to the moon is because we didnt want russia beating us to it like they did the first space launch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you really backing that backwards system why count increments in fractions why not count them like youre counting tins of beans at the supermarket and oh god what about vocal efficiency being in the construction industry myself using metric how is saying and of an inch easier than saying only time i use imperial is profiling timber as opposed to because the boss is an old boy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,si science isier i get it now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was told the only reason its still in use is because its too expensive in the us to switch to metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what most people who have no skills say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,though when dealing with metric kelvin is even better c increase is the same as k increase but kelvin is absolute zero meaning no negitive numbers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nasa uses metric except some low earth orbit missions with carryover hardware who else is going there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,watch the paint job that thing cost me million shmeckles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and for extra confusion pronounce it marsmile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this post is informative youre boring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,american system for the win
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats one that at least make sense if youre communicating between earth and mars as the days have different lengths its sorta useful for differentiation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a day has a duration of hours and a sol is slightly more than that what else would you have preferred they have called it a martianday marsday marsday or do you just not like that they called it sol like the sun i think giving the unit its own name makes sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now how am i supposed to know how much an hour lasts if its of a sol and then we need a new definition of a martian hour a martian minute and a martian second once we get there the new system will have to correlate for every unit who uses time as part of it so your speedometer that measures ms will have to know wheter those are terrestrial seconds or martian seconds the conversion unit would be but how about acceleration where we have to measure the change of speed over time so we end up with shit the conversion unit now is and how about newtons and joules and watts how much joules per martian seconds equals fuck this gay earth mars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyll all speak esperanto
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well a kilogram is a kilogram no matter where you are given that its a measure of mass the weight will certainly be different but the amount of physical matter wont change
Showerthoughts,not_removed,read again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont joke note can seriously do that know with its samsung pay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my university has a doe radiation lab that requires a retinal scan to open a door and it is one of the coolest thing ive seen irl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were just in a frustrating period of change right now where some places use chip and others are still swipe so youre never sure what to do it gets pretty confusing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because of the martian system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ground control to major musk come in major musk yes musk speaking we are currently only metres from landing sorry major musk is that earth metres or martian metres
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we cant have different meters on each planet xd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meters measure distance tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one meter was originally defined as the distance from the equator to the north pole on earth the whole fraction of the distance light travels in a second thing was added way later to make an industry standard when that switch of definitions took place the distance of one meter did not change so the fraction of a lightsecond was not a whole number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would be earth meters of is my math wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but one of those countries is the only one with rovers on the planet now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a ml is a cubic centimetre so theres only one thing to learn and if you learn the size of a cm and picture a cube of water of one cubic centimetre ml then that cube weighs one gram a centimetre is pretty close to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a centimeter is ca the width of a smallish finger my index finger about fits for many men the little finger is probably the closest one milliliter is just like very little we dont use that either you usually deal in hundreds of mls one ml might be about a quarter of a teaspoon or something in that area
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must use cc if you work in healthcare surely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah centimetres are metric inches are imperial but youll get the hang of it feet or oneish human
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too expensive to replace the millions of speed limit directional signs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well at least volume would remain the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,daughters crib so for limited time use just get some long self cutting wood screws and screw it straight through thats what i do when things go missingwobbly after a couple of moves and i dont want to replace yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damnit ikea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,home depot carries metric bolts they are in pull out drawers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the metric system is used in science
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im american i use a hellish mix of imperial and metric length and weight are imperial everything else metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im guessing theyre referring to the time a space ship crashed into a planet it was supposed to orbit because of the imperial system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im assuming they are implying that they wouldnt use it most of the sciences use the metric system across the board for its simplicity in conversions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the rest of the world already use the metric system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,www
Showerthoughts,not_removed,icann is not the internet i think you lack a fundemental understanding of how the internet works no one owns the internet in the same way that no one owns the english language or the color blue
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre a simple man right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont doubt it almost every industry uses the metric system now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ahh the indian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as soon as someone gives practical steps for the common american to ween themselves off of imperial i believe the switch to metric will happen but right now as a red blooded stubborn american i personally cant see myself switching over without some serious reeducation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,otoh pick random countries from around the world and theres a substantial chance that of them dont have their shit together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ahhh archer reference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,iirc thats not true anymore one of those two switched to metric last year i cant remember which
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i live in myanmar and i agree lol we dont have our shit together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most people i know im west coast canadian also do a weird blended measurement system for weights in daily living where we switch depending on our best understanding for really tiny weights milligrammes and grams one handed comfortable weights pounds or kilos anything up to an including a normal weight for a person pounds huge stuff either imperial tonnes or metric kilos how the fuck we get by i have no idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im being hyperbolic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,however theyre still sciencebased companies and thats a community thats almost universally metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt make it any less idiotic there are pretty much billion people that make fun of america for using imperial as their official system lets make medical decisions based on humors and ride horses instead of cars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both officially use the metric system exclusively
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a substantial fraction is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,out of the us ranks third in population size but in population density both india and china have way more people and higher population density so i guess you could call its population size substantial but it really isnt considering its a quarter of both indias and chinas separately it is even less significant if you consider how big the us is considering how much land is devoted to agriculture now if you talk about economy then the us jumps right back to the top
Showerthoughts,not_removed,china has about dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,less than
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that radians celsius or radians fahrenheit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he was talking about degrees in angles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i assume youre blind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i could go either way on that one i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hopefully we can phase those out soon though begone miles your silly value system is not wanted anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but they havent taught imperial in schools since its just a case of phasing it out my dad may claim to be but i know hes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fixed that for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so far noone has gone to mars and the only two people actively persuing it was mars one dutch and flopped and one owned and led by a south african spacex there is nothing to suggest that elon musk will only allow muricans on he wants to sell tickets to whoever can effort it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,scales will just have a mars setting which calibrates them to show for of force rather than the for of force our current scales use
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the united states the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiavoirdupois pound is used and has been officially defined in terms of the kilogram since currently the unit is defined as pounds to a kilogram
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to expand if anyone is curious weight mass x g on earth g is about because of the earths gravity so weight and mass are mostly interchangeable enough for daytoday use that is this is why when you are flying in a fighter plane or spun in those machines and are subjected to more gforces you weigh more but your mass hasnt changed so on mars you would weigh a bit less i think mars has a weaker gravitational force because the baseline of g is less but theres no less of you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no i am saying that because water is not compressible and there is less gravity on mars if we use the same measure of a kilo retaliative to the of water it will weigh less from googe since mars has less mass than earth the surface gravity on mars is less than the surface gravity on earth the surface gravity on mars is only about of the surface gravity on earth so if you weigh pounds on earth you would weigh only pounds on mars this makes more sense than my initial post because i have slept
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except its not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it wont be usa that is gonna visit the mars it will be spacex and astronauts from many nationalities
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how much for that cup of water of a kilo how about that cup of gatorade sir everything is of a kilo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,weird made up hours you mean normal hours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kelvin is fine for science celsius is fucking awful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve clearly never tried converting anything between metric and imperial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,follows the same scale as celcius so you can just add or subtract from it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a reason that kelvin is worse absolute zero is not even possible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but the freezing point of water is harder to remember
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ulanadelheeey makes an excellent point that metric is based off earthly proportions so it might not make sense to use metric either kelvin like you suggest might be a good start weight and temperatures may be affected very differently on mars than it is on earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know what you can get with five million shmeckles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you a real estate agent in israel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a billion flurbos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the hell is a schmeckle is that a lot i dont know how many schmeckles will get me down these stairs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always look for the rick and morty reference in the comments im happy i didnt have to scroll for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my glip glop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like shekels which is already a currency not very creative
Showerthoughts,not_removed,marsmeelay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im counting that as a win
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the reason they say sol instead of marsday or martianday is because marsday would inevitably be shortened to day and cause confusion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the second is defined by the vibrations of a cesium atom and does not depend on location
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you started off by making an incorrect assumption an hour is seconds long and a second has a defined duration based on the vibrations of a cesium atom one day on earth is hours which means it takes hours for the earth to rotate once around its axis one sol on mars is hours minutes and seconds and also refers to the time it takes for mars to rotate around its axis the reason this differentiation is helpful is because days will be passing quicker on earth than on mars for anything on mars it makes sense for it to be able to know what its local time is and how much time is left in the day or sol and relate that to what time it is on earth so instead of having units such as day marsday venusday etc they decided to call a martianday a sol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but a kilogram of water here is going to be a lot less volume than a kilogram of water on the moon but when you also get into the fact that of water is cube then you are all fucked on that which breaks the entire metric system i could be wrong but im pretty sure youd want another system that would be specific to that environment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice i like scanning my thumbprint for amazon on my for some reason i havent setup apple pay just dont trust it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woahho check out the big brain on uimadethosehitmanguns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,major musk is what you catch a whiff of when a fat sweaty outofbreath neckbeard walks by
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ftfy earth meters or martian meters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no no we just need to change the speed of light silly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well one meter was originally defined as one tenmillionth the distance from the equator to the north pole on earth so if you stick to those guidelines it would be different on each planet based on their radius
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i meant the the distance travelled by light in second my bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whenhow was that distance originally calculated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,samoan is only spoken in polynesian united states while english is the dominant language over the rest of the country i honestly dont know if nasa uses metric or imperial though i imagine when youre dealing with intense and highly delicate equations metric would be the easier of the two but i have yet to ask the google
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the organization that country used to get there uses metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure nasa had gone metric before then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the scientific industrial complex of that country absolutely does not use imperial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a milliliter is a cubic centimeter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do but the selection is not as good and they did not have one that met our needs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seeing as a very large proportion of martians will be scientists i think its obvious what the unit of choice will be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the metric system is used as standard for everything in every country in the world besides the us and others
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is not the si system is see kph dumbest unit ever versus ms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think in england weve somehow managed to make it even stupider on roads we use miles and our cars are mph but aside from for some reason television screen sizes almost everything else is in metric apart from milk and beer which is in imperial and height and weight apart from at the gym dont even get me started on ton vs tonne because i dont even fucking know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im an engineering student in the us right now and goddammit is converting between imperial and metric annoying ive also used the imperial system for everyday things for my entire life so actually conceptualizing how different is from is difficult
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you use kelvin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even worse you use american imperial which is different from imperial but doesnt mention this so when i convert to imperial and you convert to us imperial we both think were talking about the sane thing which itself is convoluted and different from metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was supposed to land but it crashed violently because the specs were in one unit but it was programmed using a different unit it was a direct unit substitution the math itself wasnt wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was the fact that two different parts used two different systems imperial would have been fine if all the parts used it you could just as easily blame the failure on metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres no way america stops using miles to measure roads or gallons to measure milk i wouldnt be opposed to it just dont see it happening here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oil companies uses fahrenheit and inches i believe but liter to be fair
Showerthoughts,not_removed,using the human development index – a composite of life expectancy education and income per capita – as a measure for having their shit together if we take having their shit together as being ranked as very high or high human development then we have countries with their shit together out of countries sampled therefore probability of being a country that doesnt have its shit together is let x be the number of countries that dont have their shit together out of assuming binomial distribution x out of three picked the probability of without their shit together therefore theres a chance that out of three of them dont have their shit together so it isnt really that substantial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but in this case all dont votetrump
Showerthoughts,not_removed,myanmar started the process a couple years back but on the other hand america has been officially working on it since the metric conversion act of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hear ya i mean i am universally adapted to both i try to say oh i weigh x kilos and people say what is that in pounds what really fucks me though is oz to pints to quarts to gallons that shit makes no fucking sense at all like it does make complete sense with round numbers but whats easier i have gallons so that is cups screw off i have gallons which is liters and oh look at that ml what a nice round number fml
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well we are voting on either a giant douche or turd sandwich
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more like billion making fun of imperial americans the population is billion now that being said i find it hard seeing many people giving poo about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,our doctors use mlmg like any good scientist or engineer we use imperial for all the stuff that doesnt have to be too precise and we are just used to our units driving food drink and weather the one oddball is construction but again the basic fractions are so ingrained in our culture that we just see little need to switch a standard board is feet by feet and the base system for dividing feet into inches is just too convenient in mental arithmetic to give up for the decimal point once you get used to it we can divide our unit into even lengths of and they just get and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets make medical decisions based on humors and ride horses instead of cars except that imperil system works its not like im gonna weigh one pound on this scale but head over to another and weigh pounds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the us is the third most populous country on earth so id say so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for a first world country yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well yes point being that the us is far from some primitive backwater clinging to a legacy measurement system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hundred the average is always the us though is lower than the in most other places its a stupid system probably designed that way to hide that in some places people are dumber than in others
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think so fkin hot would be something someone would say in radian celsius other than in jest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,personally i prefer to measure fahrenheit temperatures in revolutions which fits nicely with one revolution fahrenheit matching up with a kelvin temperature difference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still as far as measurements go its only inherently better than the imperial system if you need to convert between types of measurements ie liters to cubic centimeters without a calculator and lets face it most people dont need to do that on a daily basis thus theres no inherent advantage to switching everybody over
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also they are all scientists pretty sure they only use metric already
Showerthoughts,not_removed,elon musk is an american citizen i think the united states is the greatest country thats ever existed on earth and i think that it will be difficult to argue on objective grounds that it is not i think the facts really point in that direction its the greatest force for good of any country thats ever been
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there will likely be several trips to mars from astronauts before he starts selling tickets
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no the acceleration due to gravity or g on earth is about what youre thinking of is that when expressing gravity in tv shows they say that the gravity is about being the same as earths gravity so weight and mass are not interchangeable at all people just use the term incorrectly a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but the volume would be greater to equal one kilogram
Showerthoughts,not_removed,spacex is an america company
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even a of a kilo is a of a kilo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why i use it every day and i think its good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have actually try it out its just mathit wont hurt you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all american alternators use a combination of metric and imperial as you call it the shaft size is which just happens to be and the thread is threads per inch american standard as the world calls it and metricworking in perfect harmony in probably the car you drive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,weight would be different but mass will be the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a ton rover
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a whole day at mars blitz and chitz flurbos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one stanly nickel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could get rides down the steps you could get boobies the list goes on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a day at blitz and chitz
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gluplings of water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one hell of a boob job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pairs of big boobies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a rick and morty meme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as is tradition
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of water is always of water kilograms are a unit of mass meaning how much stuff is in an object the volume of a liquid is also constant meaning that liter of water is always one liter of water what would change is weight because that depends on gravity of water weighs about newtons on earth but about newtons on mars this also varies albeit very little on our scale with your distance from sea level really the only thing you would really need to change besides how many hours are in a day and days in a year is celsius temperature to match the freezing and boiling point of water on mars but thats a bit of a stretch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ftfy terrestrial metres or martian metres
Showerthoughts,not_removed,universal yards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its only meters in america where they dont get used everywhere else all the places where the metric system is used its metres
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you want zombie isaac newton because thats how you get zombie isaac newton
Showerthoughts,not_removed,being on a different planet doesnt change the size of earth they could stay based on earth lengths since thats where we originate i think it would make sense to have something like that based on earth itself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think it was actually originally defined as the length of that famous measuring stick embedded in that building in france
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nasa uses an unholy hodgepodge of both and this has caused many issues in the past
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but the engineers are a mixed lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know that but for me that doesnt really conceptualize how much it is which is what i was was trying to explain my own concept of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,freedom units
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all imperial units are dumb as fuck at least a km is exactly meters a kilogram is grams but how many feetyards is a mile ounces per pound no thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you trying to tell me you dont go to the bar and ask for of their finest stout
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ton is imperial tonne metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a general rule were used to human measurements in imperial and nonhuman in metric so you walk for miles youre x feet tall and you weigh y stones but your city is x kilometres across your door is y metres tall and your dog weighs z kilos its not consistent like you mention screens are in inches but thats the trend at least
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kelvin is si not metric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait whats the difference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well nasa uses metric and its looking like right now nasa will get us to mars so theres that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,math maths
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the us does not control the internet and the internet was available in non us countries long before obama even if the us shut down their internet exchange points all that would mean is a surge in internet hosting in other countries as websites found new hosting and possible slight slowdowns in nearby countries because data would need to take a longer route to reach them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,internet wasnt built in us it is by default international the idea came from it only also web was built in europe not in us see cern
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow just wow the us dont own or control the internet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you know what the internet is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as far as day to day life no most people will continue using imperial however metric is becoming the norm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just look at canada weve embraced the metric system but even still almost all of us know our height in feet and inches and our weight in pounds maybe its just americas influence but we still cant shake the imperial system completely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think the main reason for that is cost of conversion think of how many road signs you see in miles and mph
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was in new jersey a few years ago and noticed that the local grocery store sold litre pop bottles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtheydidthemath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now how does that compare to only having one country with their shit together out of the three what about three out of three
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so it isnt really that substantial i would say that a nearly in chance is pretty substantial its definitely not unsubstantial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just cause a country has a very high or high hdi doesnt mean it has its shit together look at my country for example argentina has a very high hdi yet the country is a fucking mess so you need to find another way to differentiate between countries who have their shit together and those who dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the us though we just dont really deal with the decimal point for imperial units anything requiring that kind of precision gets the metric treatment we would never use gallons we would use gallons pints thatll get you to which is close enough for anything not requiring metric im not saying our system is better but it makes us think about things in round fractions inches divide by base which should be at least familiar to computer geeks and musicians alike so you have conversations like is that half inch or nah its
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because quart is a quarter gallon get it but honestly the only people in my college that were quick with conversions were drug dealers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ahahah that took me a second touchetouche
Showerthoughts,not_removed,any random system works but imperial is based on arbratory medieval bullshit and the meter is based on the speed of light
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first world then you have drop a couple of states mate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by weight its about though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right you are stuck a instead of a into the ol calculator
Showerthoughts,not_removed,radian celsius would be like venus which would bequite uncomfortable at least for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats it you hit the nail on the head its a grand conspiracy by texas instruments in order to keep selling us their overpriced outdated calculators because you cant do imperial conversions without them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what does ty mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats hilarious of course he said that its not like he could say anything else if you take that seriously you probably also believe politicians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe im just stupid and its been a fair few years since physics class but im certain there was plenty about gravitational constant being for all intents and purposes on earth and varying elsewhere to accommodate for gravity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because you have to look at what they are scaled on celsius is based upon water freezing and boiling where fahrenheit is based on the survivable range of temperature for a human being sure and might be simpler than and but having the extra few degrees of precision for things like gauging weather and setting your thermostat fahrenheit is superior tldr humans are more important than water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its more work than you need to do if i want to convert units in metric its easy converting anything from imperial is a pain in the ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a what do you mean a gloops rover
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blips and chitz ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know what you can get with million jew dicks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think that means his not very creative comment still stands
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes temperature would be a thing as well as its based on freeze boil but you still didnt hit my spot about x x metric is based on making easy calculations from liquid to weight to size based on earthsea level which doesnt make enough of a difference in most cases if those are different on another planet then metric is no longer as useful as it is now and we might as well start using comparison of barely to furlongs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,terran metres d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,based earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,check your terran privilege
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i get to another planet one of the first things im going to do is change the size of the earth using really big lasers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,freedom as in freedom fries aka french fries so french units metric confirmed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ft yds in a lb also fyi in a cup in a pint in a quart in a gallon which is also or tablespoons or teaspoons come on man this is simple stuff learned this back in grade school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with the current climate id be worried itd get me on the front page of the daily mail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just read up on it quickly so the tonne is lighter by than our ton uk ton and heavier than us ton i just lets burn down measurements and start over
Showerthoughts,not_removed,basically after the independence thing we overhauled it according to wikipedia and changed some definitions an example again from wikipedia fl oz us fl oz it seems to be primarily volume thats different though we use stone for measurement while you use pounds this is likely because that shares a name with our currency so saying five stone six for twenty pounds would be less confusing than pounds for pounds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt you hear elon musk claiming to get man to mars in a few years nasa is way behind that schedule and spacex doesnt use the metric system they measure distance in elons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that didnt even happen until side note boeing still uses imperial units
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would mean a lot more then that oil is only sold in the us dollar and the amount of businesses that rely on hitting us servers is crazy it wouldnt stop anything but it would cripple a ton of stuff short term
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called the world wide web mate not united states web
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metric has been the norm almost worldwide for quite a while other than the stubborn us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt help that the dominion land grid in western canada divided up land in square miles which will never change
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see that in a lot of places actually its usually the cheap offbrand soda
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i needed an easy measure and the hdi was the closest i had so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but the speed of light changes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take the upvote damnit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or you can use an app on your phone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was referring to that guy from that show where they remodel your house and shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the gravitational constant is actually g if we plug the earths mass and radius into that we get not closer to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what keeps you from using celsius for humans its actually quite useful to know that when its below it may snow or freeze outside
Showerthoughts,not_removed,make me understand your plight give me a scenario for which the math is just too much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many marsmiles do i have to travel to get one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a dick holocaust
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eh its a maymay id give it a pass on creativity creativity is not the forte of memes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but kilograms arent weight theyre mass mass doesnt change and neither does the volume of a liquid liters and kilograms are exactly the same on mars as on earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre mistaking mass for weight weight is essentially the force of gravity on an object which is determined by the mass of the object and the acceleration caused by gravity a cubic cm object will have the same mass in kilograms no matter where it is local gravity will cause it to weigh more or less depending on if youre on mars or earth but the volume mass etc will stay the same and to convert the weight you simply multiply by a ratio of earths gravity to mars actually the fact that this is a complication that exists in imperial measurements since lbs are a unit of weight and thus would differ by planet is an argument in favor of using the metric system because metric uses kg to avoid this issue plus the math is far easier because everything is in factors of converting between inches feet yards etc makes engineering far more difficult and errorprone than it needs to be regardless of massvsweight confusion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,terran marines
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but no one need to learn the exact amount of units to the next one in metric is always
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought you were joking at first i dont really get why i should remember this when i could use logical units of measurements that are always ten hundred or thousand fold of some other unit those make absolutely no sense just reread your comment and think about itnot saying you made a mistake i just mean why should it be so complicated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yes if you stay looking at short vs long ton it gets even worse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks by the way we use stone for measurement while you they use pounds im not american
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i found this interesting so i dug deeper spacex uses both metric and imperial however they have been vocal about switching to metric as soon as us tools switch which may be never as for elon musk a proposal doesnt really mean anything im not saying he cant do it ill just believe it when it actually happens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont see how that date has any meaning present day nasa uses metric thats all thats important when talking about mars boeing uses imperial because thats the standard all american tools are built for which is fine its makes sense if your building planes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,links to a comment from rthedonald check out this fact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can you please help me understand what you have linked there your link brings me to a comment page which links to an article that just states obama is handing over the keys to the internet to the un but it fails to tell me what those keys are then this article links to another article as its source it is on the washington observer and talks about the question if super pacs should be allowed to contact supporters of a political campaign i dont see how one is connected to the other so how does obama hand the keys to the internet over to the un and what are those keys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i fail to see how having the us control icann is different from say the uk having control over icann from an international perspective
Showerthoughts,not_removed,checkmate foreigners
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i must admit your username fits you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont us hold only authority on logic that everyone agreed to use everyone else is welcome to use proprietary standards and it wouldnt use us infrastructure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,should have known you were a trump supporter you should read something outside of rthedonald and understand what it really means before posting this rubbish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well thats what i mean its starting to become the norm in the us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a vacuum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or a better reply maybe you can use that variable to give yourself less of a micro dick bam notmyfinestmoment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i love that show
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fahrenheit has many more useful numbers that allows extra precision we use for weather and for boiling thats around useful degrees whereas celsius has and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you receive a set of plans for a project designed to work with your project and someone decided to design everything in a different set of units it takes man hours to convert everything and make sure they are compatible thats money down the tubes because fuckwits dont want to let go of an inferior system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one liter of marsmiles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one marsmile mars bars placed end to end
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep i guess i never knew or had long forgotten the mass vs weight thing not in a science field so my only item has been for simple thoughts about how much does this water jug weigh and its easy to figure that out til
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blood for the blood god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoosh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was joking its ok i breathe down votes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i work for a startup in the aerospace sector in the us and we have been making steps to metric only it just makes sense especially because we have international clients
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you read the article yes present day nasa being post uses metric boeing made a conscious choice to use imperial units they were not at the mercy of the tool vendors american companies make metric tools too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its just the donald logic dont try understanding it its like looking into a solar eclipse if you look long enough you will be blinded
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how is it becoming the norm in the us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plans for what a machine a house i was really looking for a real world scenario
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats a liter do you mean shmeckle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a common misconception its mara bars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,milk for the khorne flakes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly i dont see why wed force the imperial system onto to mars when its just inferior its so ingrained in america right now so its hard to see it leaving but on a whole new planet theres no need for imperial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what does your startup think of elon musks goal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as far as manufacturing engineering architecture medical etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so basically youre an idiot that i can safely ignore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no he means an ïñch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shmeckles are a measure of weight he means a mëter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but only when the sun is hiding otherwise its mars bars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only if you remove the wrapper which will take a good martiatics of your time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,otherwise known as giga mars mile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,havent really discussed it but im pretty sure we support his goals since we are in the business of remanufacturing super alloy parts and printing of ceramics both can be used by spacex how realistic they are comes down to the people they have working for them and how they use their resources
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no need for name calling it was an honest question you gave a generic answer plans is vague and tells me nothing relevant to the question i asked but please ignore away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and what about british standard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they would die from starvation in their prison cells the people that build these will rebuild
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no if there was something as big as a way to reduce fat by in under an hour or whatever theyre claiming big companies would have investedbought them long before they got anywhere near the stage of advertising
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wont to know what the oldest person ever did she was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,she posed nude in the
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually the saying is only the good die young which is to say that if you did young then you must be good but this is not to say that if you are good you must die young you can be good and die old the only thing the saying prohibits is the bad dying young and yes im a pedantic prick and i studied too much for the lsats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,her tits thankfully
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even if she dies years from now id still think she died too young

Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe a little
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not sure about you but i dont put hot boiled eggs in my coffee to keep it hot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because its not a trilogy

Showerthoughts,not_removed,your mom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if she really wants to but im not so much in the mood
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends where you light it illseemyselfout
Showerthoughts,not_removed,raize it to the ground english is a dumb language sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats an inflammatory statementor is it flammatory
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or would it be antiinflamitory
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and why does call in sick mean the same as call out sick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every time you doze off whether its a daydream or full sleep the you that was ceases to exist a new you is born with all your memories and the belief that your existence has been continuous in short yes life is momentary how will you spend yours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you would think humans would spend every waking second of their life just enjoying the incredible miracle of life thinking how incredibly precious it is no there is wars famine hunger and on top of that most people spend of their free time working its like some kind of natures cruel joke

Showerthoughts,not_removed,dissociative identity disorder but yeah i just said the same thing the other day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no at least some sperm can make it through the cervix upon immediate contact and can live for up to days afterwards inside the womans system even if she cleans herself out after sex it wont prevent pregnancy any contact can result in pregnancy unless you use proper birth control methods condoms birth control pills
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eww so it digests into her body

Showerthoughts,not_removed,some person kept signing off on limp bizkit albums yea that sounds great guys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,technically yes but an island is more specifically a landmass that belongs to a single nation as far i know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dictionary definition a tract of land surrounded by water and smaller than a continent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am disregarding the definition and changing it for fun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in that case arent all dogs just cats with floppy ears
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so maybe trade the dates for a butt sniff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you need to change your dating technique
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some of us came from primordial sludge you dont see me looking for attention
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some of us are descended from badasses whose deeds were unwritten at least thats what i tell myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless all their children are dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well of course the queen of england is an obvious example of that plus the myriad of people who can trace their ancestry directly to genghis khan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all of us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im related to king george the first my ancestor was thomas de mowbray first duke of norfolk and all dukes of norfolk are related to king george the first so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,despite some of these comments tryin to be funny u are correct i believe op
Showerthoughts,not_removed,especially since theyre built in the woods hey we got your friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,great now i pictured a house made of people bodies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine a log cabin with a fireplace and a station wagon outside
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and having to watch them being built
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ever seen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eh in certain tree seeds germination can be triggered by the smoke of their mother plant burning nature is pretty metal the trees would probably not mind

Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is correct what laid the egg which became a chicken was not quite a chicken
Showerthoughts,not_removed,according to the sentence of the riddle the chicken came first
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe this is a question that never gets old and can get a room of people to spend their day explaining to each other whos right great post ps it was a tardactyle that laid the egg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i suggest you watch a youtube video by asapscience before you go making assumptions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you give your child a prefix or sufix adopted child rescue child child from a previous marriage you are doing it wrong they are just your child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agreed if you found your dog hanging off a cliff and you pulled him up great you rescued him if you walked into a building and pointed at a dog no you did not rescue him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,weird my rescue dog and my rescue kid sure dont seem to mind when i refer to them as such
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well you wouldnt call your dog your adopted dog that would be redundant also its not a hey look at me im a good person thing its more like a hey i got a great dog this way and you can too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you saw a middle young homeless man about to be put down because he was bothering people by being in their neighborhood and instead you take him home to live out his days in peace did you not rescue him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agree with the op its called a dog and no one gives a shit where you got it from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doesnt really apply since we dont put down homeless people does it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,awwwe did your mom edit the privacy settings so you could watch southpark now scute
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unfortunately no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah youre totally not pompous
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i refuse to accept that pluto is no longer a planet this was not a discovery but an arbitrary redefinition of what a planet is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry but you are mistaken op pluto is a planet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats messed up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and its demotion was to that of a dwarf planet a status that didnt exist until plutos demotion thereto
Showerthoughts,not_removed,neil degrass tyson is a bad mother
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even if we could exceed the speed of light most galaxies are so far apart that moving between them even at scifi speeds would take longer than humans live space is big space is really big do you know how big space is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its quite possible the speed of light cannot be breached a possibility that needs to be considered it could be physically impossible for two life inhabiting worlds to contact each other or ever travel from one to the other due to sheer distance and the expansion of space
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we must construct additional pylons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its free every socialist fallacy ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,refrigerated bottled water is more expensive per litre than petrol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in some places the tap is unsanitary for drinking i grew up in a city where i was raised not to drink too much tap water in fact i didnt drink any tap because it tasted gross i eventually moved to a town where everyone drank from the tap and i was horrified until i realized it was safe and clean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your opinion would be kind of a hard sell in flint michigan for that matter ive lived most of my adult life in places where the tap water tastes funny and often is brown with flakes of rust sure the water tests clean at the reservoirwaterworks but ive never known an inspector to come to my apartment and test the tap water its just assumed that it got through the miles of pipes okay without picking impurities along the way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is just weird petrol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,although i cracked up when reading this i also disagree with it not everyone gets dumber with technology some have used it to do amazing things on the other hand i think you might have a hilarious comedy on your hands 😂😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt make us dumber more like lazier i bet aliens just sit on the couch and watch reruns of friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait i swear theres a new tv show about aliens i think i recently saw a commercial before a youtube video
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre so fucking cool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know man they also tend to sell nachos a good portion of the world is lactose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im gong to call you last horse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what gave it away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,took me like years to realize this also that regen regenerate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shitty ff mobius
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt realize this sub was for basic facts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they are not where im from give us some pictures
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sofas are a packaged to take up a smaller space in the fridge they dont do it with beer because they know youre just gonna drink it all in one night so it doesnt matter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be used for hours only
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never put my sofa in the fridge 😝
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this motivates me to get motivated about getting motivated to subscribe to rgetmotivated so that i may also one day get motivated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in that case im in dire need of a rgetsuccessful subscription
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for some its existence itself i think thats worse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just under cold toilet seats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as is dreamless sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you almost always dream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am not very active on the social media i make no statuses and upload no photos my grandgrandchildren will wonder how is it possible not to have a granddad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can squash a normal sized spider
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah you can this thought is actually pretty lame lol but the idea is if i had to choose one way to be killed id go with the bigger one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shadowbans galore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,um i think you might be the drunk one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seconded
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is no evidence of no god because you cannot prove a negative there not being a god is the default position its the opposite that must be proven the burden of proof lies solely on those making the affirmative claim
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but no religious person ever understood this fundamental tenant of thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol srsly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow ive been mature for a long time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maturity to me is realizing you have your legs death gripped around a dead horse whom you love dearly but is never coming home for christmas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,story of my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and some are complete duds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and theyre illegal in many states
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and if handled badly can blow up in your face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,interesting its like theyve been living in hell for a while so it would be nice to experience somethinf calm and relaxing for once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,angel good source for fun loving deamons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,demons are supposed to be narcissitic thats the point of monolouges the reason they are cheeky is because they are free thinkers they are meant to be questioning because according to all faith questioning is evil
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by your reasoning at least a few angels are evil
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure at least a couple angels would like to do some bad after being around nothing but purity and goody goody once they get back to earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha i actually love this get ready to exhale
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should get tested for asthma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and now watch me as i inhale the rest of my life away for yet another terrible year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unlike your current body which has just given up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fellow honeschooler here reddit couldve sufficiently replaced all of my curriculum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg shut up grandad no one cares
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or if you were born in the or or or
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure only the galaxy note is capable of being a torch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and basic calculator notepad yes kids an actual pen an paper a black book or contacts book a radio some phones let you use headphones as an antenna a compass i could keep going
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure all iphones from at least the onwards possibly the as well can be used as a torch too edit god i need sleep that went well over my head
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope most phones can edit oh its a joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woosh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,since when can the iphone set stuff on fire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well any can but the note does it accidentally
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or are they completely unrelated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tacos are mexican not spanish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope its the same here i have this pipe dream of moving out of the states but theres no time for that dont have the money for a completely new life in another country
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im with you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,since when does shit roll uphill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its the feeling of getting dupped though i stay for the music
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a friend who speaks to his dog in english and afrikaans and she understands commands in both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me grammar nazis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,formally better than i is correct while better than me is wrong the latter however has fallen into common use and is no longer wrong the former remains academically correct though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,last time i checked reddit wasnt formal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,last time i checked being formal wasnt being wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not saying it was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if the reason he hasnt been doing crazy shit like in biblical times is because corporate started micromanaging him ever since the flood
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the only way he can get to super heaven is to get the most minions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then the higher power would be god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in truth every living being has a universe existing within them and they are the god of that universe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact treadmills were invented to generate power from prison inmates
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oooo neat im guessing that wouldnt fly these days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are in an environment you choose to be in if you dont want to be part of the world you currently live in abandon it and search for a better one there is no live here or dont live because the earth is a diverse cultural world with many different life styles and if you wanna create your own do that and people that think the same will follow you just take life into your own hands if you arent happy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would be useful on the phone when you get played by that moan trick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a short story called httpwwwgalactanetcomoneofftheeggmodhtml by andy weir of martian fame that tackled the topic in an interesting way that eventually led to an injoke between my friends that includes the phrase we are all kenny logins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy fucking virgins donkey ass piece of shit douchebags period dick that was mind blowingly interesting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my hand never fits into the can
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what did they change their packaging there is a little ridge you put the lid over on the bottom and it stays in place now if they opened from both sidesthat would be some innovation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its thinner than the top
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if youre ft tall in the middle of downtown smart guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,worse in what sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,feet m post feedback in rtometric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shit right thanks convertstometric bot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably not kleptomaniacs dont steal things because they need them they still for the thrill so more likely they think their sick all the time and shoplift things from various stores like all other kleptomaniacs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont ever speak that hogs name with denis learys name you twat and fuck carlos mencia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not quite wishing youd never been born takes the burden of decision off of your shoulders
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not necessarily when i hear queens bohemian rhapsody i sometimes wish i wasnt born at all idk do you heard the song it says that in the lyrics ill be honest and say i have had suicidal thoughts before though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no if youre suicidal you want to end your life if you go i wish id never been born you may be experiencing embarrassment extreme discomfort or something else that makes you feel so out of place you think it would have been better to not be and get into that situation i have never seen it as the same thing because it is an andor thing you could have both going on the suicidal thoughts and wishing youd never been born you can wish youd never been born without being suicidal its more of i wish i could escape this moment somehow being suicidal is a person being in a place so bad they dont just want to escape any specific moment they want a release from all the things helping to keep them in such a dark place it is unfortunate every damn time someone gives in but we should never think them weak we should remember how long they fought and what dreams they may have had because even if we dont commit suicide you never know when your numbers up cherish your dreams please hold on to your loved ones dont judge people because of things outside their control skin color gender and sex encourage them for their dreams better each otheri dont know when i started giving a short speech but there it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont read fairytales
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most of both are so hard to get to and use that they can safely be ignored
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how did missionary come about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,church trips
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont believe you i dont think you believe you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reread my username
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the day you get a selfdriving car keep pretending youre driving it then suddenly climb into the back seat where your dog is and see if it freaks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not sure they know anyone is driving to them the whole room is just moving
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont know about my dog but my cat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would imagine dogs having a keen sense of smell and hearing know that humans travel in said machines and probably are responsible for controlling where said machine goes however smart the dog is would probably be a good marker its not like a dog would question wether you control a bike or a similar vehiclemode of transportation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow never considered that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think so because my cat is allowed to play under my feet while we watch youtube videos of trucks but on the road hes not allowed there seconds of truck noise and he is right under my feet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does the dog understand that the car is moveing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dog would paw at me when she wanted me to stop somewhere im pretty darn sure she understood no different then when shed make sad eyes and paw at me when she decided it was time for a treat at home
Showerthoughts,not_removed,videos of people doing this will be the best thing to come from self driving cars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what would a dog freaking out look like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or put the dog in the drivers seat first and look at him expectantly as the car begins to drive itself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah ha very true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my cat loves watching motorbikes and forklifts hes right at the window if one of those kinds of sounds is near he sits and watches in the mirror as they load or unload stuff all the time first time he was in a car after about years of being in the truck we are sitting at a red light and he seen wheels go by the window his eyes were red and he jumped up i looked in the mirror and said are we in a damn he flopped on his side and meowed then jumped up again to look up at the different pickups around he knew it was a small car and not the truck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone said on the radio once they were stuck on a hill minutes later my cat sat up and stretched go around another corner and he hopped up on the dash come around the next corner and could see the truck stuck on the hill he looked over at me and meowed he knew for minutes what hill it was by the name the guy said and he knew exactly where we were if you ask me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say they do there are videos of dogs getting ok buses and then exiting at the same stop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like a person freaking out but its a dog instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you never watched scoot doo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive watched scooby doo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jolene meets her favorite toy come to life in entertainment views since oct ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was awesome thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre welcome also dont talk to strange bots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look into your eyes and move your headnod
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre so wrong that game is great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aka unconditional love
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre stage clingers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a saying not because of how good your eyesight is its because the more you stare in another humans eyes the more oxytocin your brain makes oxytocin is responsible for feeling of belonging spirituality and a sense of purpose to yourself and the universe yeah its a just a chemical but yeah its your soul pretty much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like your interpretation of the saying stay off of drugs kids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,similarly every year has seasons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ooh nice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah see that one annoys me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because sunrise and sunset change there are two days where its exactly and but midnight and noon will always be the middle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i suppose in the case of seasons itd be more a case of every year has two summers or winters depending on the hemisphere because january in australia for example is summer it is followed by autumn fall winter spring and then summer again in december so summer autumn winter spring summer seasons in a year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but mars has days and nights too and theyre almost exactly the same length of time as ours is there any planet that orbits so far from its sun that it doesnt experience either day or night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well we could just live on the moon it turns slowly enough that the sun only rises and sets about once a month rendering the calendar useless
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill go with that sidenote assuming there is life elsewhere and it also sleeps i wonder if it has evolved to for example only need to sleep once a month or am i still being too attached to the idea of a calendaroriented sleep cycle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i have i work from home and i sleep whenever im exhausted be it or on the very rare occasion something reasonable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha touché congratulations citizen youre at the top of the governments wait list to move to the moon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,smallville had a plot around this clark had a football scholarship but realized it was going to be too hard to deal with drug tests and such i think there was another superpowered guy on the team pulling shady stuff which made it clear to him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wormholeswarp drive but those are some pretty dangerous things i dont necessarily think we should play around with even if we could within the limitations of physics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i grew up realizing im way crazier
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know what i mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if by sleep you mean die i agree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bit of both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe i think its that they are always challenging a demon or ghost like they have a chance of beating a metaphysical being while at the same time having no knowledge therein in others they always make illogical choices that generate poor results other times they never just leave there are a lot of things wrong with horror movies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eh like im binging stranger things right now and like after s nancy sees the monster thingy behind steves house
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i watched a couple episodes of that showits creepy af
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yae im watching one last episode before i go to sleep bad idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i try to have the mindset of if you cant afford to tip you cant afford to eat out not that ive never shorted on a tip myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea ive heard all the excuses the fact is if you are not tipping for good service youre just a cheap bastard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was the same scrounging the change jar for the pizza person my mom however at one point was server i was instilled with at least per item this was in the couldnt scrounge a tip meant no pizza
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sucks that because the tip has become an unwritten rule if we were to get rid of it like most countries have it would have a severe negative impact on the economy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg yesss i would pay money to see that kind of mod
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant wait for community racing tracks for such a mod
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ha my dad didnt need a take your father to school day he came to school with me one day anyway if ur teacher is a jerk to u or if he normally doesnt teach much of anything cuz he doesnt care they wont act like that with ur parents around at least mine didnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol i bet your classes that day improved a lot and i meant like if the parents were watching through a camera that was in the class and the teachers didnt know it was there note that the computer to see the cameras transmission is in the school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah that was along time ago back in the before a lot of this technology came along i told my dad before he even came that him being in the room with me during class while mostly just embarrasing would make mr h be on his best behavior and i was right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im assuming your dad stayed for the entire day so all of your teachers would have also been on their best behavior which i bet was fun to see them all change but also a little embarrassing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he didnt stay the whole day just til lunch but yeah it was kinda funny seeing my teachers trying to b super educator for a day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think your weed is bit strong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your eyebrows are just moustaches for your eyes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mouthbrow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eweeeeee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agreed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant text links
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an tomato
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it would be like soy sauce on a soy bean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you never put ketchup on a burger with lettuce and tomato
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you tell me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah you know veggies get a and fruits get an didnt you hear
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and soy sauce is fermented whereas you use fresh tomatoes for ketchup
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it just seems different somehow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish that was true since editing titles seems impossible ill claim this instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know i was just messing with people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is something i struggle with living abroad i would say im from the united statesus and would get the response ooooohh america and the argument is too trivial to bother when youre having a conversation in passing i prefer to say from texas in an attempt to break the texan stereotype its interesting how of people know where texas is but get confused when i say iran korea is easy though they have a specific word for people from the us so i just use that now migook
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well you could also say united states
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its the price we pay for naming our country after the continent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,muricans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yanks it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it does estadounidense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the way i see it no other country in the americas has america in its name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so someone from the usa i can call a united statesian looking at it statesian could actually work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because one is sign language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,until you get older and realise everyone is exactly the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the youngest person in the world is the first alive whenever this shit gets reposted again word for word
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true story
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but whats the birth to death ratio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was this already posted earlier i didnt knowif it was ill take it down dang i thought i came up with something original for once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ahhh yes here we have exhibit a a huge dose of anxiety
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in slow motion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt that mean technically everything would be the same when they die their life actually starts so it wouldnt make a difference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first breaths when you get out are pretty damn good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre thinking to small
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow really
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is not rnotinteresting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok 😳
Showerthoughts,not_removed,teach them what how to kill the most people with the least amount of steering how to do a drive by shooting how to weave through an intersection at speed without crashing while ignoring all the lights
Showerthoughts,not_removed,vice city was my own personal miami katana simulator
Showerthoughts,not_removed,honestly i would not have passed my driving test if it werent for vice city i used to practice all my manuvers on it and see them from all the different perspectives
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt work if you were learning with a manual transmission like nearly everyone in the uk does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to avoid all those of course lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its sad that youd prefer to dream than live
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or a perpetual nightmare the doctors would never know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was the plot to an ally mcbeal episode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah that worked out really well for michael jackson
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is it really though who on earth could possibly claim their life is as good as they dream it could be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they come here to sleep they come to be woken up the dream has become their reality who are you to say otherwise son
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no one really i would think there is no one that would claim their live is as good as their dreams but i wouldnt want my dreams to become my reality lucid dreaming is something that i dont often do and what if you became trapped in a nightmare id much rather living my life and sleeping each night than being in an internal uncontrolled dream state if you had control over it inception style then that is a different situation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now that is about the perception of reality but this isnt inception we know in that movie you pretty much have complete control over your dreams that would be cool but in reality its not like that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,keep in mind that most dreams only last a few minutes and long dreams rarely last longer than half an hour
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like this make it worse now your reality is broken into a few minutes each time sounds horrible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not like you would notice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but you may as well be dead mins in and you forget everything rinse and repeat forever no thanks life more than just yourself its about the relationships you make and the people you know youd not get any of that in a dream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what makes you think that your own life isnt a dream that you didnt just enter this day with memories provided in its script like any other dream while youre dreaming your sense of time is extremely warped minutes could easily be a lifetime
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn youre good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the purpose of life is to make a purpose whether you believe a divine creator gave you life or not youre here might as well grab life by the balls and give it all youve got
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its whatever you want it to be for some its bitchesothers its a family and some its to make name for themself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends on your worldview if you are someone like me whos a christian then we were made to love others love god and be loved by him if youre on the other extreme end of the scale maybe militantly atheist for example then technically no we all just kind of happened to appear here for no reason there is no purpose but even then that doesnt necessarily make it pointless just purposeless but no matter what you believe or whether or not there is a purpose or a point the only way to gain happiness or satisfaction in life is to take life by the horns yourself i wont assert that my worldview is the right one but i would advise you to put some good hard thought into what kind of worldview you believe in the point is different depending on what your worldview is and its probably a good idea not to miss it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bill burr knows dudes in tune
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not true im an atheist and i know that there is a reasonable scientific purpose for existence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean i think having a scientific explanation and having a purpose are a bit different
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have two cats i think they tell each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always wonder if my cat thinks when we snore were just purring rather loudly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he probably doesnt even know he is a cat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my cat snores so loud he wakes himself up sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please put a video of your cat snoring on raww
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had one old lady that snored like a cartoon whistling snore that lil fucker was cute as shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are you gonna do about it if you could stick a breatheright strip on your cat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tragedy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,record it on your phone and show him the video later
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have just the one weve thought of getting another one but the timing wasnt right i wasnt aware there was a kitten season and its not in the dead of winter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a good thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unfortunately yes for my cat and he has now adapted a combination of snoring and purring i really liked his purring it was so loud and awww
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats true i mean after all were the ones who put the label to different species maybe he knows what he is and its not a cat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also my cat isnt that smart so theres that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont have a cell phone or another really good way of video taping him doing that but ill add that to my todo list
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah id just let him know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats funny you commented on this post he literally just started snoring and hadnt been before that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kitten season is anytime youre on kijiji but you have to be vigilant because those guys are snatched up in minutes of posting how i got both my cats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,purrmeow combos are the best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was not aware thanks for the info
Showerthoughts,not_removed,since when do cell phones correlate with responsibilities i happen to live in an area where there is no cell phone reception you pointless commenter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good luck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not in the slightest but good guessin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre pretty pathetic trying to poke fun at absolutely nothing i pity you and your obviously sad life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what area are you in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant believe you typed that with a face i thank you for your pity and put on my robe and wizard hat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,california
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuckin hell man youre not making yourself very popular
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill muddle through somehow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually whenever someone doesnt sneeze they do a full dab for no reason
Showerthoughts,not_removed,attention criminals free guns available here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nra agent lives here we are watching you xd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,negative thats just a signal for figure out my schedule and rob the fuck out of me unless thieves know exactly where the valuables are located in a house with an alarm they are moving on to the next one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually it does say that it was a rough not frozen sea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes they did dont openly question religion in stupid ways if you havent done the research tip your fedora elsewhere edgelord
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually it does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also doesnt mention if it was the dead sea or not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would take some pretty crazy talent to sail a boat in completely frozen water lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jesusof the northlands
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont call ice frozen water do you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just mean if god made us and he made them he would give us the same religion at least one over lap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure it says exactly what body of water and based on the time of year and location i do not think the sea of galilee ever freezes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont know what the dead sea is then do ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a lake on the other end of a river with the sea of galilee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and what would possibly make you think i was talking about the water freezing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the main question of this post am i in the right place i mean i assume you dont think the dead sea could be salty enough to walk on maybe duck feet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,definitely easier to move on than standard water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for sure salt content and all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so then it wouldnt be hard to think of ways you could use that to convince others especially poor and ignorant peasants that you can walk on water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i see what your saying but surely these people would know of the buoyancy obviously not the science but sure they had swam in it and would know you float easier than other water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right float you float because your weight distributes yeah the salt holds the distribution afloat generally you would sink if you stood up as the weight now becomes penetrating due to being focused on your feet realistically it wouldnt be hard to use some kind of trick to stand or walk on the water like snow shoes which allow you to walk over loose packed snow via weight distribution
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah if you planned the trick then there is do doubt it wouldnt take to much to do i mean even some properly weight wood that stuck about feet below could aid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly and convincing peasants who consider god and magic to be real that youve performed a miracle isnt hard hell people still do it to this day how else do you explain nickleback still being together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would love to know how much is original vs added over time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah that is what i always wondered i did my time years catholic school and they told some wild tales not just on the bible but the faith dont be mistaken i do believe in god and i think christianity is likely the closest to correct if such a thing exists but then i think if we meet aliens that are not of any of our faiths they must all be wrong similarly if we meet christianmuslim etc aliens that must be the correct one or their living to take advantage like wepeople always do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah you lost me at catholic school man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry i have been meaning not to reply on reddit when min after smoking i forgot since i am in the zone taking down christmas things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was gonna say all religious people think theyre the correct ones then you started in on aliens and shit man what were you smoking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but they have to take responsibility rather than dumping that to others
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no they are sometimes taken beacause they have to be taken
Showerthoughts,not_removed,read a book called the march of folly by barbara tuchman several historic accounts of folks doubling down on terrible ideas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is completely backwards in my opinion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ding ding ding dingdingdingding logic train there it went
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til young women dont want something from guys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah we want you to have a job not be drowning in debt be emotionally stable have goals and a plan to get them year olds dont care about that because they have no idea they need to care about that yet youre just so much older and more mature than all the guys her age after all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and somewhere in between there comes marriage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope men like younger women because they would do better breeder on a biological point of view yeah we are animals and its not because we dont smell each others ass anymore than we stop to follow our instinct i need to go there is moon outside and i need to scream at it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woooow someones butt hurt no they want younger women because theyre too young to realize how crappy a year old man must be to actually consider a relationship with an year old
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in mine too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre my favorite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wubba lubba dubdub
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am in great pain please help me some pretty obvious parallels there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uni reap what uni sow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a viscous cycle because people with depression wont seek help for this exact reasoning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only thing thats good about crippling depression is that it shows you who your real ride or die friends are the few people that stick around and try to help are the only people you should keep in your life imo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets face it sometimes depression is a burden people would tell me i just ruined their moods and they didnt wanna be around someone who was so negative
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know you didnt intentionally misspell vicious but damned if you didnt add another layer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and theyre right because they are not free anymore and tbh who gives a fuck about the others i wanna do whatever i want not stay with a depressed guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tiny mindblow right there typos can be clever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,naw memes are eternal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wake up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both sexes would quickly learn to control their tails so as to show you only what they want you to see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people do that but more subtle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ruh roh looks like someone may have a latent furry fetish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well one gender kinda has a tail and it does respond in a certain way if you do the right thing the question is if you swing that way and if you consider not wearing pants to be socially acceptable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even dogs wagging happiness a stiff wag can mean the dog is nervous or even on the brink of being aggressive in order to assert dominance over another dog id guess with women interpreting tail wags like that would be infinitely more complicated edit whoops i fixed it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you still wouldnt take the hint
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i found the furry guys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the problem kinda goes away if you have absolutely no dating standards at all ps ick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,online dating would be a lot easier of women actually replied to me even things like no thanks or i dont find you attractive or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also a raised tail would imply things i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well depends on what you say and what point of view youre looking at it from 🙄
Showerthoughts,not_removed,opposite sex the gays cant relate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rfurryirl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt that what smiling is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would be socially acceptable to go around sniffing each others arses to gauge interest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres totally not a hentai manga about this definitely doesnt exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt this how smiling works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no joke though this was my fantasy for a very long time as a kid even if we had hairless monkey tails it would still be pretty neat to see how fashion and culture would develop around it to see if we would be able to control it ourselves or if it was just this autonomous appendage that had a mind of its own that could betray our emotions oh and also it would be fun to have one to play with fiddle about with your tail in a fit of nervousness or use it like a belt i have put far too much thought into this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,move to japan and make your dreams come true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh that big ol thing dragging on the floor behind me thats my tail baby
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called a smile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could date an embryo embeyos have tails
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is a good point even though the tail thing sort of sounds like a furrys fantasy i understand what you mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called smiling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op is actually a low key furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think we found the furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,until they turn into a giant gorilla during a full moon and you are forced to cut it off with a destructo disk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i found the furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you want catgirls to eh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,google would be inundated with search requests for how to fake tail wag or how to suppress tail wag
Showerthoughts,not_removed,males have this tail and let me tell you its a problem not a solution
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wellit could have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we men have a tail its just in the front
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called a smile dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you heard of smilinglaughing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do microexpressions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,boners getting wet blushing general charisma anything but a tail i had a girlfriend with tail bone it wasnt that big but she was pretty skinny ruined doggystyle for a grip
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre on your way to becoming a rfurry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op are you telling us you wanna date a furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people have these things called mouths which occasionally turn into whats called a smile when the person is happy or whats known as a frown when they are upset use these facial indicators to gauge someones emotions welcome to being a human
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that your tail wagging or are you just happy to see me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wed just fake that too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know when my jack russel wags his tail it generally means that he has seen a ball to chew up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some people have nubs from tail genes im not joking its natural because we evolved there are certain things like that which still remain in our genetic code
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah except humans would fake wag like they fake laugh and smile now so it would end up the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could also just look at their face anyway its very easy to see if someone is interested in you while some give very overt signals others as they become attracted become more shy and actually withdraw all those signals so that means body language is pretty useless for gauging someones attraction to you luckily you dont need any of that to know whether someone is interested in you if someone is interested in you they will give you their full attention and theyll listen intently when you talk all other signals vary from person to person but this one will always let you know its the same for both sexes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people give plenty of signs if they like you a tail isnt going to help you if no one will wag it for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do its called their face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,make her laugh pretty unambiguous
Showerthoughts,not_removed,irises they respond to things we want dont want in almost exactly the way youre looking for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you staring at my tail my eyes are up here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can fix you up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know if its true but ive heard that neurotypicals have something called body language thats supposed to be like this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,while we dont have tails we most certainly have tells body language and eye contact can tell a lot about people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my general rule of thumb and its never failed me is that you know pretty quickly if she likes you if she doesnt and youre still trying it simply means youre not taking no for an answer the notebook is a movie guys if this happens with a lot of women then you probably need to change something because trust me its you not them and not some lack of signals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in humans this is called a face youre supposed to look at it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rfurryirl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do frontal tails not count
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean the rolling eyes sighs awkward body language staring at their cell phone or staring aimlessly away into the distance isnt enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kind of like a smile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,faces
Showerthoughts,not_removed,start reading up on body language youd be surprised how often people do the human equivalent of wagging their tails
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dating would be a lot easier if i were capable of reading body language understanding facial expressions and had social skills
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do but its called a face and this face is often easy to read
Showerthoughts,not_removed,genius seriously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont need something as obvious as a wagging tail to read body language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know a lot of human communication is always taking place on the brink between what can be understood and what cannot no one will ever tell you that thing you said really attracted me now i want to kiss you even though they could instead theyll smile and hope you understand the meaning its not that we dont have unambiguous ways of communicating its that sometimes we purposefully dont use them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a giggle a snort a touch on the forearm a hand on the lower back a coy smile a lingering glance all varying degrees of tail wagging if you look for the signs if you want to date something as easy to decipher as a dog go on tinder like everyone else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nonverbal communication isnt hard to learn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stay away from my dog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some chicks have a tail in the front
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would want a spider monkey tail to grab things hang from hold my beer it could have a mind of its own plays grab ass without my knowledge gets me in trouble im like oh tail you did it again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what makes you think you would be any better at reading tails than you are at reading human body language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,humans subconsciously use body language quite frequently there are lots of tells to see if someone is comfortable or enjoying themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do body language stand up straight smile and laugh and youll get laid also dont be a dick its really that simple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guys already have a tail but on the front side and it doesnt wag when the guy is happy but you know close enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,smiles dude look for her or him to smile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if only people werent so passive and insecure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dating would be a lot easier if the opposite sex could smile that way i could see if heshe was smiling or not after i did or said something your dog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an inability to pick up on non verbal social cues is often a sign of aspergers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,elaine hes a waglier jerry jerry a waglier oh man theyre the worst elaine i know right jerry yeah well youll just have to cut off that relationship there is no going back from that kramer hey got any kibble whats going on jerry yeah it on top of the fridge elaine kramer what would you do about a waglier kramer you know my friend bob sacamano yeah he had his tail cut snipped right off now nobody can tail if hes a waglier or not brilliant jerry apathetic yeah real brilliant elaine cut scene
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so what youre saying is it would be easier if people would honestly communicate their feelings instead of lying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the tail is on the front
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men already do that with their front tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah just implement the fallout thing cate liked that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called a face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,screw tail wagging lets just go straight to sniffing each others butts and genitals as a greeting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,failing that a face would be pretty handy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or it could be nice if people at least wore something to suggest they are single and open to dating for example women could wear like a big a on their clothes to show that they are available perhaps even make it a red letter to bring more attention and really make it obvious to other singles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,facial expressions work the same although i dont know if anyone here knows how to have a face to face conversation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why ive become a master at reading body language but all its really told me is how much girls dislike me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dog tails are really just a dedicated limb for fidgeting itd probably makes things worse if you couldnt tell the difference between a girl being afraid or excited
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see the invention of lying the premise is that noone lies and the life of ricky gervais as the main character is full of brutal honesty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually there are a lot of things woman do just like rail wagging to let you know they are interested biting their lip slightly touching their hair biting nails ect just be sure to look your date in the eyes with confidence and you will get those reactions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people do have the ability to read social cues its called not being autistic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men already have tails that wags depending on what the other does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we smile and blush and play with our hair we open our arms and we open our legs we point our feet out and we make eye contact all when we are excited
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you saying that you can only date the opposite sex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as if hearing how they faked their orgasms arent bad enough this user wants to add a whole other level to faking it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i meanyouve already got that just as long as your ok with dating a girl called fluffy or princess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think i saw a porn about that once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there actually is a tail product that you can buy that reacts to your emotions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i once got bit by a small dog wagging its tail you still wouldnt know what they are thinking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know that bitch likes me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres aggressive wagging and the happy waggy youre familiar with and probably other subtleties besides deception as has been mentioned theres simply that people would likely display how they felt in different ways and you could still interpret them wrong sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people have tells you really dont have to be a professional poker player to notice if others are interested in what you are saying i look for the slap across the face to guide me in polite conversation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we should just skip right to it and use cage fights to determine who gets to reproduce that macgreggorwhoever guy would win and then the world would be populated by his clones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we can already do that through body language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would not be married for as long as i am right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its all flirting and romantic till theres a full moon and everyone turns into an unstoppable giant monkey and destroys the world i dont think youve thought this thru at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get a fucking grip dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean dating would be a lot easier if women didnt always go for the chad kek
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if your a girl just touch the guys painus you will then know same results as a tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they have involuntary pupil response next best thing also gives you a reason to look people in the eyes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but smelling butts would be awfully awkward
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you can handle wading through the toxic misogyny browsing pua media may help you get a better handle on reading body language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well men kinda have this though the tail expands instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guys have tails that get excited just not where other animals do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets play spot the furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why i only date animals with tails so much easier
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if youre ugly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ryiff might be what youre looking for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you so insecure and have that little confidence in yourself that you need a green light to approach and flirt with a woman also whats the fun in knowing absolutely everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this post reeks of neckbeard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg people its called smiling its the subtle cues that we give off when we like something or someone the eyes the posture hands etc we have lots of little things that reveal how others respond to us its pretty easy to tell when someone is into you especially with todays technology have a date and they text you afterwardscontinue to text you they probably dig you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guys we found the furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just how hard is it to realise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,found the furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the eyes chicothey never lie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how would poker be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tail wagging is also the reason dogs are absolutely the worst animal to be depicted playing poker
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would rather have a tail like an scorpion to ward off my enemies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they eyes tell all my friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i saw dis fing on itv the uvva week that said if she plays wiv her hair shes probly keen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you just read that one doujin too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,date a neko girl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fox tail buttplugs market would crash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i want to know a females opinion on this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im only here to make a joke about chasing tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,really if you cant tell then its probly not good if im wrong find someone whos not pretentious and hard to amuse its the most natural thing dont over complicate it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,body language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,protip assume they do not like you even during intercourse you really cant be too sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if your into men its easy its called an erection
Showerthoughts,not_removed,males do have a tailthat wagswhen you do or say something they like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like an elaborate excuse to be a furry but ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,try using pupil dilation hands on your arm leaning forward drinking from your drink these work too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men would wag their tails when happy but women would wag their tails when angry neither would know this about the other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eh i see my boyfriends boner all the time still gets me excited
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men have a penis that can wag when theyre happy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah well we had to lose the tail for you to be able to write this look at you now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have a tail upfront guys remember
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is a song about this that replaces tails with mood rings relient k mood rings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men have something like this we call it a penis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you cant tell without the tail you may have autism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are non verbal cues that should easily tell you body language is a huge tell examplethe way her legs are facing when she is talking hair twirling removing barriers such as crossed arms or a glass in between the of you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is this fury shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of them does have a tail its more in to camping than wagging
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this isnt monster musume so good luck with that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am prepared for a non erect tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and yes dating would be much easier if everyone showed genuine emotions all of the time though it would also be really weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tail privacy settings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we could even invent some etiquette norms likes wag your tail when greeting a stranger when speaking to a boss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sad but true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,designers would come up with a tail wag restricting dress sort of like a corset for a tail to let you remain in control
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i cant control an erection how the hell am i supposed to control a tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i often wonder if we had tails would clothes have a hole for it a sleeve for it would it be tucked down a leg or would it be sticking out the waist band also if there was a sleeve analogue for tails what would it be called realtailquestions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both sexes would quickly learn to control their tails we did we controlled them so strong that we got rid of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a guy i cant even control the one i have you want me to control another one too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,master of manipulation right here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does that mean social media is the tail of the modern human
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah thats the difference between us and other wild animals except for a few we are the masters of deception in the words of house everybody lies our dog tail equivalent i believe is our mouth and eyes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in other words it would be the same exact thing as smiling which we already have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men have been trying to figure this out since the beginning of time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tails are involuntary muscles nice try though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kind of like their faces and emotions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if that happened think of all the kinky things that would suddenly be real and possibly fairly common
Showerthoughts,not_removed,poker tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not all bodily functions are voluntary tail wagging would just be one of those involuntary responses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,speak for yourself i would be wagging all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now if the tail is an involuntary movement that you cannot control then we got something going p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not even subtle its just really easy to secondguess your reads if youre anxious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in what ways
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not even necessarily subtle smiling laughing making eye contact etc are all good signs that someone likes you whether romantically or not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea but i cant pick up on it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not that bad i draw the line at nekos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i came here for this comment i actually thought this was in furry at first
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtailplug nsfw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,zoinks scoob
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op should just come out and say it he just wants to do freaky shit with that tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aka the human horn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if humans had tails they wouldnt wag would they do monkeys wag their tails wed have all kinds of inscrutable and subtle tail motions regardless
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and a cats tail wagging definitely happiness you see a cat with its tail going get away from that cat like go in another room and close the door
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was thinking rdoujinshi httpimgurcomaiiadz
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when is it not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they have ears that respond to emotions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but that causes a whole bunch of new problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a woman who has actually done the gracious thing and sent rejection messages i can tell you that a shockingly high number will come back with some kind of response insulting me because im not interested hence why most women just dont respond
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the reason they dont is open hostility a ton of guys doing the online dating thing are simply spoiled kids in adult bodies while you may appreciate it many of these online guys will just get demanding threatening etc women are usually flooded with messages very few of them from nice guys source did online dating and was disturbed to hear the real stories women would tell me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to then id get floods of messages from those guys that went for days weeks or sometimes months ranging from begging to abusive i think they saw my reply as a slightly opened food they could jam their foot in just read no reply as a no thank you edit door not food
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah except any message just makes some guys think maybe theres a chance realize that the woman probably wants to reply but her experience has shown her that doing so is almost always a mistake besides does it really matter isnt silence enough of a no to get the message anyway if you put a resume on monster and get a call for a job that you would never take do you call them back or just ignore it thats what dating sites are resume dating
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no reply usually means shes not interested dont take it personally keep in mind that any woman you message probably gets scores of messages every day and responding to or even reading all of them can be exhausting try apps like bumble hinge or tinder that at least require a match before messaging so that you at least know the door is open
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bruh tinder gets the do we meet each others minimum level of attractiveness question out of the way its brilliant success on normal dating sites was zero success on tinder has been much much better get a reply in about of matches i talk to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you cold contacting them you would not believe the kind of abuse women get online so it is easiest to ignore everyone but the very few you are very interested in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsiytimgcomvisqxsghsjduwmaxresdefaultjpg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah yes things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,from my point of view the jedi are evil
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,autistic people have a hard time reading facial expressions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i thought too people would just control their tails just like smiling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was trained to fake smiles because apparently it makes it easier to fit in with human groups
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait thats not acceptable now that explains a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i genuinely didnt think there were so many autists on this board that smiling isnt the top answer and the question quickly deleted im concerned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,username checks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,smiling is a sign of simian aggression
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people can control their smiles though tailwagging is largely involuntary which makes it a more reliable indicator
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or maybe an antenna
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no how is it done
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think the challenge a lot of guys on reddit have is even with those cues they lack the courage to make a pass and they need to understand that of the time the woman is not going to you must touch her arm take her hand kiss her for most of them this is the hardest part
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell us about your perfect social skills and how you have never misinterpreted anothers response grabs popcorn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre missing the point you could have a sexy tail to help me get an erection understand your emotions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not for sonic fans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont need to take this from a guy who has sex with breakfast items
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see the invention of lying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,though it would also be really weird you dont look as good as your pictures and your ears are slightly different heights youre fatter than your pictures made you out to be and is tall for a woman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most girls would stop going outside can you imagine always seeing how horny you made each person around you every day though that would probably become the norm and horniness would be viewed similar to coughing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah woah woah there whale i might be drunk but im not stupid my inner monologue should never be made public ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are these emotions you speak of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,confirmed op is a furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would involve honesty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not necessarily emotions but intent if women said simple things like are you interested in me if so lets go out it would clear up a lot at least for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you think all those people genuinely want to know that im only feigning sincerity out of a curiosity for how they look naked and how they move their hips when they fuck i think this lying thing works a lot better for everyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if we showed our emotions all the time someone like me who suffers from horrendous social anxiety would be fucked im standing in a grocery line waiting to pay but youd think krakatoa was erupting right under my arse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,life itself would be easier if people were just honest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only weird to begin with then it would be wonderful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,am too genuineopen most of the time and can confirm am weird and dating is terrible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also known as a rope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wag for no one renegade for life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reject that candidate he gave a very limp clammy tail wag
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would send a clear message if you get slapped with the aforementioned tail though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would it have hair fur or just be a flesh tail would dick size matter less because girls could always get off on your or their tail which can be assumed would be larger than anyones dick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,face blushing expressions posture voice i think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,body language laughing and smiling are the easy ones eye contact touching arms crossed body turned probably more but these i keep in mind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,raging boner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,grooming iois mirroring for sexual interest are some ever see a girl play with her hair while talking to you its her saying look how healthy i am in interpersonal situations people cross their arms if they are defensive they lean towards you if they are open to your ideas they lean away if they are disinterested heres my personal favorite if you want to convey truthfulness when you are talking put you hands together flat like in prayer at the conclusion of your point open your hands and show the other person your palms i negotiate for a living these things have helped me immensely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,capillary dilation or the socalled blush response fluctuation of the pupil involuntary dilation of the iris
Showerthoughts,not_removed,erections
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even in not subtle ways like smiling laughing sustained eye contact touching your arm its honestly pretty easy to tell when someone is having a good time now the hard part is telling if they are actually interested in you romantically that is a bit more subtle but it only takes a bit to figure it out usually the distance you stand from each other is a big indicator if your facesbody are almost touching then shehe is into you and probably wants to kiss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,women will run their hand through their hair unconsciously if they like you with practice it actually gets very obvious if people are into you or not its not hard to tell at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if someone dilates their pupils at you or after you reveal something that is a dead giveaway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,constantly touching their hair and smiling is probably the best indicator on women
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bullshit holo is the best and shes a wolf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpscatgirlcareorgdrugspng
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i draw the line of nekos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so kemonomimi the type of person hat doesnt fit in to the furry community
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a powerful aphrodisiac
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lower horn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes spider monkeys which have the most dexterious tails theyre basically a more flexible third leg wag their tails when theyre excited
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually it depends are its ears up does it have huge pupils kitty is high as a fucking kite watch your toes but youre probably safe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heres a sneak peek of rdoujinshi using the httpsnpredditcomrdoujinshitopsorttoptyear of the year httpimgurcomalnhjs im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its amazing how much of an advantage simply not being a total arsehole gives you on tinder ive seen my girl mates tinders so much bullshit from guys ranging from bog standard lewd to damn right insulting was worse when you could send pics my sister had a folder of about dick pics shed randomly got sent without asking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,either that or they just refuse to recognize the actual content of your words and continue to charge ahead with the attitude shes still responding she must still be interested
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the club when i was about or so talking to this girl and she asks me to dance some of her friends and some of my friends join us so my buddy moves up to one of her girlfriends and tries to start dancing with her the girl puts her hand up and says hold your horses there cowboy just here to dance but thanks and he loses it starts yelling at her calling her a bitch whats wrong with her etc not only pissed off this girl and all her friends off but ended up cock blocking me because of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg i got sent a message by a guy that i had a match with and it went into my filtered folder so i didnt check it immediately hours after the first message i got sent a hate filled rant about how i think im better than him im not attractive anyways and hes too good for me apparently he was just messaging me because he was a nice guy and i should be thankful he ended with a big fucking thanks for not answering me you cunt like seriously online dating is horrifying for women sometimes i try to defuse with a thank you message if the original message was fine but about half the responses after that turn into the above
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder if it would be a good idea to just outright ban the guys from dating sites which make the dating site experience worse i dont think dating sites have any real moderation except for pictures
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there should be a messaging option in dating sites to simultaneously send an impersonal not interested notification and block someone that way you dont have to worry about how to word it you feel secure because theyre cut off and they still get closure or i guess you could just block them not sure how all the different sites handle that though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,slightly opened food they could jam their foot in im obviously doing the wrong things in the bedroom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats sorts of food can you jam your foot in out of curiosity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you call them back i email them back yes im not interested here are my requirements thank you because its always a recruitment agency
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no reply usually means shes not interested i do get that what i find frustrating is that i cant change my approach if i have no feedback on what im doing wrong bumble hinge or tinder thanks for the recommendations afaik both of these require facebook to use which i am not willing to do if you have other recommendations please let me know though thanks for replying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gets the do we meet each others minimum level of attractiveness question out of the way as long as you never swipe on face only profiles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the website saves so much time so i dont have to message girls who arent even interested in the first place if i really try at it i can line up four dates in a week with online dating websites there would be endless talking before the girl agreed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but i have to have facebook for tinder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,risky click of the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where on earth is this from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like an erection lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rempiredidnothingwrong

Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofburncentersintheunitedstates
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does that mean autistic people also have a hard time understanding vertebrae expressions i dont think the face would be the whole issue in that scenario
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if all humans had tails wed wag them at people we hate to be polite same problem same answer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i think we know why women dont like you now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i get you but it sounds like youre cutting off your nose to spite your face maybe people would like you more if you smiled more not all the time mind you justmore of course theres a difference between a polite respectful smile and a warm personal smile after all thats what a smile is meant to convey and hence my comment that youre happy and approachable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,charming
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look at their eyes when they smile not their mouth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you just need to get better at reading smiles when people smile watch their eyes not their mouth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what makes you think people wouldnt do the same thing with a tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate to break it to you but if people dislike you its not because you are not constantly smiling i rarely smile partly because im sad partly because i dont want to be fake and partly because i have a gap between my front teeth and yet plenty of people like me nobody is expecting you to smile all the time just be genuine and good treat others the way you would want to be treated and people will think youre pretty cool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol im not gonna lie ive had my fair share of idiot moments
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the worlds going to end if you dont have sex with me right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,somewhere in an honest world hello i really want to have sex with you i unfortunately for you do not find you attractive and do not wish to have sex with you that hurts however with your rejection and my current state of hormones coupled with the fact that there are still attractive people around i will resume my quest to get laid tonight goodluck i feel you will need it again that hurts smiles robotically still better than dicking around and wasting on food and drinks just to find out she wasnt that interested
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love when jennifer garner masturbates before the date so she doesnt get horny and fuck the guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i promise i will never die
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pepsi when they dont have coke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see blushing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i invented the bicycle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you literally complaining that a woman is too tall o m g
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know i really dont like you much at all but im desperate and horny so if youre willing to have sex with me ill stick around for a bit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not showing emotion though thats just being a cunt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on the other hand youd also know of all of the times you made girls horny which in all honesty would be pretty fucking awesome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt know we were considering horny an emotion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you seriously get horny walking by random women
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah they would just straight up wear full burqas and niqabs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe just stop trying to have sex with large aquatic creatures
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it confuses me as much as it does to you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for women it will be great to ask a guy are you really interested in me or do you just want to fuck me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im standing in a grocery line waiting to pay but youd think krakatoa was were erupting right under my arse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yeah i walk into the club with my swag girls and guys i make errrbodys tail wag
Showerthoughts,not_removed,voice is verry important i once read somewhere that woman tend to have a higher voice when talking to someone they like and maybe its the conformation bias but it looks like its true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt consider myself very savvy on picking up on these things ive probably missed a zillion signs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,these can be false clues too so a combination of them and prolonged study is necessary to really get someone thats dating in a nutshell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if shes playing with her hair youre halfway home thats been my experience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,boners the tail on the front
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh man have you ever been in a restaurant and sitting at the table next to you are two people on a date thats just crashing and burning the girl is leaning way back in her chair arms crossed dead eyed and hardly engaging in the conversation while the poor guy is just rambling on and on and thinking hes knocking it out of the park i wish there was some secret hand signal i could make to the other guy to let him know the ship is sinking shits brutal man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so if a girl crosses her arms and turns away from me she likes me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yall are going to hate me but if she accidentally brushes her breast across you in a dating context make your move women have absolute body control so it was no accident
Showerthoughts,not_removed,otoh people use the simple things to trick you all the time leaning in playing with hair hand on your elbow or shoulder mirroring i have seen girls do this to pass oral exams no pun intended hell i have done em see if its consistent when they dont need anything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you want to convey truthfulness when you are talking put you hands together flat like in prayer at the conclusion of your point open your hands and show the other person your palms confirmed i just did this i feel very truthful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre watching television suddenly you realize theres a wasp crawling on your arm

Showerthoughts,not_removed,neko means cat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you did not just fucking call holo a furry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow my brain is scrambled thinking of the moral implications of people doing things like that ive always assumed sex robots would happen and they exist of course in basic stages but have never considered biological thinking but not selfaware subhuman sex robots that dont use humans as a base for their biological aspects if any nonbiological components would even be required
Showerthoughts,not_removed,runexpectedfuturama
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damnit summer stay out of the catnip garden
Showerthoughts,not_removed,starts sfw end with my boss yelling at me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so she kept them in a folder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shoulda seen the folder of dick pics she did ask for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no fucking joke one dude mustve had the premium on okcupid because he could see that id read it but chose not to respond so then he hounded me until i did respond when i said i wasnt interested he kept fucking going finally had to block him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there exists a certain person who acts nice with the sole purpose of getting into bed with the opposite sex at the end of the day and no other real reason as soon as you make it clear that they wont be able to have that as the end result of whatever they had planned with you and they turn hostile real quick because they have no reason to hide how they feel anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even knowing women got flooded with messagesreplies and reading funny posts about niceguys i never put two and two together that it happened that often til
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every girl i know who has online dated has had this exact experienceand not just it happened once but im applying a blanket statement but more than id expect them to have tried
Showerthoughts,not_removed,online dating services should have a feature where you could report it a staff member would check it and if it was genuinely nasty and uncalled for the person would get banned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,flip side was at a party once having some drinks with a girl i was really digging so i asked her if she wanted to go out and have a drinkdinner some time she politely declined and apologized later found out she was after one of my friends so i calmly said its fine and it was just a proposal and she was free to decline her and her friend were shocked at my calm response and also the fact that i was still interested in hanging out with them i didnt know why and i was quickly informed of the average guys response to being rejected i had no idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a guy and i dont understand the guys with that mentality what is getting angry about it even going to do it makes no damn sense shes not going to suddenly change her mind because you acted like a bitter emotional asshole it makes me wonder if theyd act the same way in person or if its only because they are online
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guy here checking in with my man card to echo what said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they kind of make their money based on the number of users they have increasing expenses moderation and decreasing revenue would make it tough maybe some sites do that but i bet it costs more to join which means a smaller user base which maybe idk means less success which in turn means less interest in spending an increased amount of money on a membership and that means even fewer people joining
Showerthoughts,not_removed,individual users can block the individual guys typically and they can register a complaint on ok cupid a friend of mine used to be a moderator he said the main problem was people not walking awayblocking people sooner

Showerthoughts,not_removed,do we have time to get a hotel room
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cum with me if you want to live
Showerthoughts,not_removed,taking notes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gonna use this one later
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only time you get remotely close to this is with a fuck buddy i remember when i stopped with my last one she looked at me after sex one day said i dont wanna have sex anymore im not that attracted to you anymore like i was at first in reply i said sounds good theres a girl at work that just got hired and i think she wants me in reply she says fuck yeah get it is she hot then we went on to talk about the girl and then parted ways with a hug and a kiss after we got dressed wasnt awkward at all we were just both ready to move on when everyone syncs up emotionally honesty is a very good thing and a healthy thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not entirely sure the person being rejected would handle it that well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this would be an awesome world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they did an experiment at one of the ivy leagues where researchers went around politely but directly asking other students to sleep with them and recording their responses they had a simple script which was essentially hi ive noticed you around campus and i think youre very attractive would you like to come back to my dorm room and sleep with me for male researchers asking female students the yes rate was around for female researchers asking male students somewhat higher take this with a pinch of salt though as i cannot remember which book i read this in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that makes me think of your vagina
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and youd also have another way to say hey that guy is so much better than me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i consider hunger an emotion in my stomach
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called catcalling and i definitely avoid going outside because of it well which is it and or definitely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who doesnt like cats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont get it the whales are soliciting him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my tail shimmies to tha left n waggles to the right erybody in da club knows ill bark and ill bite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,explains why every girl i talk to sounds like james earl jones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im batman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is totally true it must be subconsciously trying to make ourselves sound cuter and therefore more attractive but we totally do the voice thing and giggles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all people do that everyone uses a higher voice when they talk to someone they like they dont know ie buying food from a store or a ticket etc i do it too and both my female and male friends do it everytime
Showerthoughts,not_removed,conformation should be confirmation but your version amuses me greatly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i heard my exs normal voice for the first time ironically i actually liked that voice better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so thats why every girl ive talked to sounds like darth vader
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that last one is probably the hardest one to spot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,saying im not wearing any panties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe they are just showing common courtesy and are canadians really cant tell if they are into you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe take one day off and go to a local busy caffeteria get like three teas one at a time and just watch people maybe you will have good time just watch out not to be too creepy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres also eyes along with face hands the blushy area above her clavicle hips the list truly goes on its called body language for a reason this goes for anything with a body but most importantly the gradual differences in the patterns of how all of the body signals change based on your presence is possibly more revealing than just one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or zero signs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah you probably havent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not good a pick up lines period
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they say people talking in a group point their feet towards the person theyre interested in dont know if thats true other ones ive heard but dont know if they are true are the person who likes you will mirror your body language ex cross arms if you cross arms and if everyone in the group laughs or someone tells a joke they glance at you to see if you are laughing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you tried making your own signs use a pretty but easy to read font
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh man this has me in tears my attention span isnt that long so when the tread was posted i just posted anything on the top of my mind but your commend made me remember a lot of situations that you just described and i really thrive of those awkward moments thanks man ill be entertained for at least half an hour
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly the wrong interpretation of my words
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reddit reflex autism diagnosis in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes and if she starts running away then she wants you to chase her silently and intensely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you like it when i twirl my hair dont lie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and sometimes what they need is to be liked ive seen these signs with women who were into me as well as ones who definitely werent but wanted friendship instead im just not handsome enough to warrant the quantity of signs i see from the quality of women if a woman is of approximately similar attractiveness level as myself then the signs matter if shes out of my league then they are likely not accurate and if shes below my league than i dont really care
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are japanese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tubs is my favorite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure he called her a wolf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you muthafuckas did not just call horo holo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats muse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean i wouldnt say no to a world like nekopara
Showerthoughts,not_removed,celebs could sell their dna to make sex clones of themselves itd be a real fucked up world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course she kept them so it was facepenisfacepenis then you can play a game of bigger or smaller you see their face and have to decide if their dick is bigger or smaller than the last guys and thats why id never send dick pics ever wanna see my dick you gotta come to the live show
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rniceguys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to run with a guy like that funny thing is that their are spades of women that do the same thing he had no problems finding them and yes he would go ballistic and berate the new women friends he met if he got the signal wrong for someone that slept with a lot of women i think he actually hated them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because they got told that girls like nice guys what they should have been told is that girls like it when men theyre attracted to are nice to them not at all the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah if you were ever on the fence about feminism ask a few women about their online dating experience d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never gotten angry over being rejected its going to happen and you have to accept that getting angry isnt going to change her mind or endear anyone to you its just going to make you look like an insecure loser while also lowering your chances with every other woman thats around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the goal of banning users isnt protecting the one forming the complaint but protecting the future user course i guess a lot of mods or maybe companies dont understand that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is known
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pictures of the same group of women with no indication which one she is shes the fat one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no dont you see its clearly a front tail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is no better time and no better place then now and here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i suppose it depends on the person and their experience with rejection if youve been rejected plenty of times they almost just bounce off then you go to the next one strike out a thousand times for one home run
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mostly this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol i never actually even considered that possibility only shows how unrealistically big my ego is yeah im in your boat id probably spend my time sobbing in bed in fetal position
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meirl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most of the time depressing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my tummy is horny timmy thats hunger weve talked about this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe you should stop trying to pick up girls at senior centers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i find your lack of dates disturbing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i could swear i read this exact same comment chain here on reddit a few years ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for the last time dale that wasnt a girl that was james earl jones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and single
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup i see this i notice girls also proactively offer more information than asked and add things to try to keep the conversation going longer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men are supposed to go deeper with women they like though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey girl didnt you use to be my girfriend no im your father thats how i imagine that conversation going down
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so i shouldnt have given her mine after coming back from the toilet women are so confusing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah she could just be canadian and being very polite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im glad you specified that the teas need to be ordered one at a time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah im just gonna order all the teas at once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im now depressed and i have to pee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but how are you supposed to notice the change in body language based on your presence you dont know how the person acts when youre not around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok thanks kind of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yer autistic arry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we had that sussed before we even opened the thread but i suppose some people are always late to the party
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt say i didnt like it i said i dont believe you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,personally i would never be friends with someone who does that shit its purposely manipulative to make romantic interest signs at someone you only want to be friends with
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can you smoke anime
Showerthoughts,not_removed,directions too complicated got dick caught in senpai
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i draw the line at knowing what a japanese is

Showerthoughts,not_removed,username checks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you did not just call korbo horo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if theyre half human does it mean its only half unethical
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its an elite club
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or what their pms are like when they reveal they are female on reddit misogyny is as real as can be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but my son is watching us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,than
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i agree but i also think that sometimes the honest process comment would be that hurts but i now hate you for rejecting me and feel that you are an ugly slutty bitch and dont deserve me or something like that i think peoples defense mechanisms for that kind of rejection would be quite jarring to hear
Showerthoughts,not_removed,statistically speaking at least a few ladies have fingered themselves while thinking of you you are only here today because your ancestors out fucked everyone else you are made of sexy cells
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is great stuff keep going guys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my voice doesnt really get higher when i want to impress someone though just louder oh hi uh how is it going nice weather ttoday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this going to be on the test
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never had this i am usually offered nothing to keep the conversation going
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this probably isnt subconscious though obviously if youre enjoying the conversation youll try harder to keep it going than if youre talking to someone you dont really care for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well we try but theres only so deep some guys can go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a year old male and i sound like michael cera with a clogged nose explains a lot edit fixed it you meanies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we need to go deeper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i read that men actually express a range of high to low with someone they likethe lows suggesting the patriarchal male qualities for sexual attractiveness and social standing and the highs suggesting theyd be good dad material and a stable domestic partner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for guys my impression is that higher voice is an automatic reaction of nervousness while lower seems like a more conscious attempt to be attractive or at least a learned habit rather than innate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought women were supposed to go deeper with men that they liked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,really ive always gone higher that may explain some things though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so if a woman says it its a good thing but when a dude says it then suddenly it becomes creepy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i messed that part up the first time i tried it and at first i just worried that i looked like a weirdo with my three teas so i chugged one which gave me seconddegree burns to my mouth and throat made chugging the second one pretty difficult but once id finished that one all that made me look odd was the constant stream of tears down my face and the intermittent wimpering all in all this first foray into controlling my social awkwardness wasnt a total success but it was up there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,been sitting here for hours alone with three cold teas directions unclear what am i looking for again ustupidmertie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh you just average together the behavior of the people the last ten times you got laid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a good question however you might be over thinking it picture a person you like say in class sometimes you see them interact with their friends sometimes with members of the opposite sex sometimes the teacher and then sometime with you theres likely some sort of difference in that person between all of these situations right those differences have the information picture the person you like working at the front desk of some business youre in line and you notice them dealing with customers blithely until its your turn you walk up and they change bigger smile more energetic etc well thats interesting isnt it it means something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no but when you meet theyll have one set of body language that will gradually slide into another set
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stalk her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uhhh just watch how they talk to other people surely not all of your interactions are on in complete privacy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in case you are interested there are some good youtube videos about the thing called httpsenwikipediaorgwikimicroexpression those reveal the true feelings of a person for the fraction of a second and you need to train yourself to catch them body language also plays an important role if you have time maybe have a look at some episodes of the tv series lie to me tough they exaggerate a little bit everything they use in the show is valid edit better link
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like that the period is at the end of the smiley face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,smoked anime once now im gay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but isnt that worse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn skippy

Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact its self lubricating from oozing lung surfactant if you get deep enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plus youre dutch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not wearing ant panties termitie whities
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ant panties sound uhh uncomfortable i wouldnt wear those either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if your mom got murdered in front of your eyes pretty much universally you would be sad the richest of the rich or the poorest of the poor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sincerely having trouble thinking of something that would sadden me but bring joy to a child in syria also depression is not sadness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not that bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well hopefully its better than ending your own life too soon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but practice makes perfect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it depends on the individual for me its like wow i cant even properly kill myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its actually not too bad and it gets better with time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,somewhere there is a movie script in here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were the people in the car your parents
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no family violence has been known to end in bat fights between siblings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then theyre dicks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does that make us assholes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no phil were drama not comedy its ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure they didnt think of this level of ridiculousness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i havent seen house of cards ever someone please
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get abused and learn how to make dope beef wellington thats my fetish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you added so much salt and pepper i can hear the dish singing push it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he has a actual cooking class series and its awesome hes not a dickhead which presumably took a fair bit of work on his part
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but only in regards to print orientation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like it btw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are places and organizations just significantly fewer unfortunately
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gynocentrism the duluth model violence against women act belief that women are too weak to do actual damage except when they throw objects pour boiling wateroil cut off penises etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,double standard no one cares about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most resources are gender neutral there are not nearly enough for the demand regardless the claim that men are more likely to be victims of ipv are incorrect women are disproportionately affected to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think it is because women being in control is kind of a new thing rather than the controlling husbandfather
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called a bar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same reason boutiques are for women only its a matter of economics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kind of but also think which one is more likely to occur i dont know the statistics exactly but im pretty sure it happens to women a lot more not saying there shouldnt be any outlets for men but thats probably why there arent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you are incorrect to imply a double standard the reality is spousal abuse was normally ignored by law enforcement until women demanded and finally legally achieved protection from an abusive partner women called the police but men were not arrested despite clear physical evidence of physical assault marital rape was only recently considered a crime as well the double standard was providing married women rights that all people should have had perhaps a review of the past would clarify the facts for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,recent studies suggest its just as bad for men they just dont admit or talk about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you just formed this belief off of prejudices and sexism nice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men often suffer from psychological abuse then cant leave due to the fact that the spouse could take everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats impossible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hence the word tried
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no comment chain here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a rebel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i assume you dont eat garbage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i seized my cat taking shower for it sought out the louses and crushed them with fingers they had tough shells very smart and ugly i spent months cleaned them out of my cats body
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where i live theres something called fresh slice maybe youve heard of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not specifically but i cant say ive never reached back into a garbage bag to pull out something sitting on top
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not how evolution works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,humans are apes please present your theory in more detail and please provide evidence for your hypothesis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and herewego
Showerthoughts,not_removed,humans are not apes and never came from apes either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plz dont do this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,obligatory source please
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fortunately everyone knows fish are pathological liars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he would forget about it before having the chance to tell his friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,story sounds fishy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some of these may have some thoughts httpspayredditcomrshowerthoughtssearchqfishabductedsortnewrestrictsrontall
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i promise i had not seen those apparently im not the only one who first thought this hahaha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait concealed carry as in a firearm and recidivism as in the tendancy to return to a life of crime i dont see how those two things are related care to elaborate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i suspect op is suggesting that a robber could be concerned that any potential victim could be armed even if they dont look it thus discouraging the crime from occurring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this could indeed be true in some cases but i think that desparation can still drive people to take risks irregardless i mean isnt the presence of a judicial system supposed to act as this deterrent already
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not saying i agree with op just speculating on his point i dont think hes wrong and i would think the idea of being shot by someone you are trying to rob as being slightly more discouraging than the idea of maybe being caught and spending my a few more years in jail but yes desperate people so desperate things also stupid people do stupid things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not necessarily many peoples jobs require that they travel and within that group most leave very little if any room for company
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my boss is a married man and he and his partner live in the same building but on different floors works for them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everything in the world either is or isnt dog shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if they werent friends on facebook thats totally how this works i saw it in a vicedocumentary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i realize i generalized all moderators but yes there are some really cool moderators out there mental image of the online mexican federales is priceless
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha i guess thats true unless your the mod of rthecoolguyclub
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fairly applies here fairly more than pretty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the same vein awfully increases it awfully good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the inclusion of damned has the reverse effect though pretty damned good is better than good pretty damned bad is worse than bad pretty damned stapler implies that someone has a shameful fetish for office supplies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that either depends on location or if youre american how condescending of a douchebag you are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes i know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i stated that it increased it if you had bothered reading it i thought you might have noticed that i was talking about the type of word obviously not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if its not farmed its mined thats where all raw materials come from im including ranchinganimal husbandry as farming
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where else are materials supposed to come from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as opposed to from mars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its just something most people dont think about look at your iphone literally everything its made of was taken from the earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well duh where else would it have been taken from literally everything on earth was made from the earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well no not literally everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes literally i mean unless youre gonna say a moon rock or some stupid shit like that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a moon rock or some stupid shit like that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or spelling your phone is people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahahathe iphone is the cant do without item some people have their whole lives invested in their phones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,without people a phone wouldnt be very much use though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,use that phone to figure out the difference between then and than
Showerthoughts,not_removed,drunk sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,being right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and even more differently when you realize it was conceived during world war and not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think vegeta would have something to say about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well technically one can rule over space dust its just why would you want to who else would care
Showerthoughts,not_removed,after the russian revolution the tsarist state was gone but plenty of white russians kept their titles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he could still order around nappa also what is up with all the main characters becoming generals in the rebel alliance in empire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah yes weve all heard of tsar leia organa solo first of her name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,man times have changed dating when i was a late teen was never about buying things maybe a meal or a movie but even then we went deutch it was about going to public places to do social activities with each other or just walk aroundand hang outlearn about each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre doing it wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aaaaand were done here good job folks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a great song though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,celebrity deaths are becoming as common as mass shootings and police brutality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably the same thing if i could remember never return anyway i always figured eddie riggs reaction to the idea of going home in brütal legend was pretty accurate for most gamers in a similar situation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what if you had limited time or you could never go back i mean the mindfuck is even if you do enjoy the moment you wont remember it so its like why do it anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would literally spend time finding a way to stay if that failed im sure there are arrangements i can make with some powerful entity or another to bring me back to wherever and then write down a very detailed journal to read later also that wasnt the original premise of the question the way it seemed phrased to me was if you could go back but forgot everything in which case i would stay become an adventurer and live a life of high adventure and trying to get a cute monstergirl to go out with me and likely either retire a hero or die a glorious heroic death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and trying to get a cute monstergirl to go out with me do not fuck with me how did you read my mind o
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we both have good taste i suppose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ever since humankind learned to masterbate there probably hasnt been a single minute where someone wasnt touching themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think this is the best shower thought ive ever read
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre the real philosopher here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just like that no customization screen intermission lobbies changing servers or class or nothing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,showerthoughts or highthoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then i get more pussy in death than i do in life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well nobody reported any fish smell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if it smells like fish you probably should back away quickly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well what about walking towards the light
Showerthoughts,not_removed,took me forever to realize reddit was short for read it as a way to make people say i read it on reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imgur ur img mind blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never had realized this lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit you just unlocked another door
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or imager theres that too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the king
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no they just bing it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just alta vista it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bada bing bada boom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for gamers often the best times they had with video games were their first moments hoursdays because everything was new and exciting we wanted to experience everything but expected nothing yet when we grind out a video game to the top percentiles we get up tight and salty about every little quirk and it no longer is exciting or fun because of how much responsibility and obligation has taken over i find this parallel with our childhood and adulthood strikingly similar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn you are so right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretzels are knot bread
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they resemble a person in prayer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at least stan lee can conclusively be proven to exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stan lee and jack kirby
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well he is the one above all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the universe not a universe if i draw a picture and call it a universe does that make me a god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpmarvelwikiacomwikioneaboveallmultiverse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are now a mod for ratheism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe they entered publishers clearing house and are hoping for the best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,criminals are surprisingly social
Showerthoughts,not_removed,define clean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive definitely had them all dirty at once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if you wear someone elses clothes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wash my clothes naked all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not quite what your link didnt disprove my statement but rather talked about some technicalities with webcams and resolution
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes all you have to do is make eye contact smile than nod everyone just wants a little recognition not to hinder my favorite response when someone says its good to see you is always its good to be seen try it next chance you think to and watch that persons reaction its devine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok but in my example theyre avoiding eye contact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is there an argument that backs up that assertion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im an atheist and i couldnt care less
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont see what ducks have to do with any of this but alright
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wont care at all about anything once im dead why should i worry or fear that then seems like thats a waste of the life i do currently have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nobody can tell us about what happens after you die i dont care what your bible says or what rules it has made up to make people perceive a punishment or reward for what they do in this life death is a part of life and is inevitable trillions of people before us have died and trillions will die after give me a real reason to be afraid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,somones pissed at atheists or other atheists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i think anyone scared of death are idiots itll come for us all eventually were mortals regardless of racefaithand any other trait about us not being afraid of it is actually a gift for whats the point whatever drives you to not be afraid its a boon in my book
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure ya did genius
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres no rationale for an atheist being required to be scared of death in fact theists have a better reason for being scared of whatever consequences they believe to be ahead for their actions than atheists who simply dont give a damn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you too sweetums sweet dreams
Showerthoughts,not_removed,top kek
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is both cool and unnerving
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who cared
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it could just be the same person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so which one are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah very aladeen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,christian bale edit i am not really christian bale
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice ps youre hot edit i know you are not really christian bale
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called wrestling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if you have a well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but cheaper than bottled water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it feels better to think that youre better than everyone else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that depends on if youre right or not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the button should be labeled wtf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know everybody hates apple but the apple tv has this feature
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just have subtitles on all the time because i have kids who like to talk all the time loudly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this wouldnt be needed at all if tv networks and movie studios made sure dialogue was not too quiet or being mumbled
Showerthoughts,not_removed,appletv can do that speak to the siri remote what did shehe say the video will rewind seconds and temporarily turn on the subtitles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is pure genius right here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,peaky blinders would benefit greatly from this innovation imo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a tivo i had a long time ago had a button like that it wouldnt turn subtitles on but it rewound a bit i think i used that button more than any other on the remote
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you use mpchc player you can press on keyboard left arrow rewind seconds back and w turn on subtitles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it should also slow it down
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh man i love youtubes new double tap to rewind or ff seconds feature i use it a ton its only missing the subtitles lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my amazon firestick remote jumps back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also turns them off i generally have subtitles on i have roommates dont want my computer being too loud and bothering them and subtitles help subtitles also help a lot with the bbc shows i can handle the bbc shows without them unless im really tired but its just easier and therefore more enjoyable when theyre on i cant even count the number of times in netflix where ive turned off subtitles and gone back seconds because there are forced subtitles on the screen being covered up by netflix subtitles saying speaking spanish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if you want subtitles just turn them on which is normally one button and if you want to rewind a short bit just press the rewind button why do you need a button that unnecessarily complicates things by doing both those things tbh if a program has subtitles aka isnt live or on a weird channel i generally have them on anyway theres literally no reason not to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably the best feature of the apple tv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably the only unique feature
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sorry and congratulations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and movie music didnt blare over important dialog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just have the captions on all the time with that show and can just hit the ten second rewind button
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes you just cant hear that last part
Showerthoughts,not_removed,consider other people too not everybody gets every single second of dialogue sometimes the dialogue is mumbled but you also dont want to have subtitles constantly and always enabling and disabling subtitles takes way longer than just pressing a button or asking siri on an apple tv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can be damn sure its patented too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a couple of books that talk about life in the they used to mad dress up and then put it on im assuming not much has changed even in the we would see women getting off a plane and yanking them off and be in dior head to toe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it isnt symbolism it is nitpicky legalistic following of the precise religious rules and yes those rules make no logical sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely not muslim women dress up and wear make up and whatever they want underneath their religious dress hijab burqa niqab etc its a personal choice to adhere with that portion of their religion just the same as it is yo do makeup it has a lot more than modesty behind it and ties in a lot with what western culture perceives to be very backward thinking gender roles but if its part of their belief system that they willingly follow and they respect it but it doesnt strip them of aesthetic choices they make with their appearance outside of the headdress besides who said that makeup is immodest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoa mate dont ever make sense they hate that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,really cuz i think its sounds despppppptryingtosoundcleaverandfunnybutfloppingtremendouslyeeeeerate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think it sounds heeeeeeeeeeeeeiamchannelingnaplockblubbabutthatsokbecauseheisoneoffivemeseeeeeeeeeng
Showerthoughts,not_removed,according to the movie hitchhikers guide to the galaxyyes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it cauterizes wounds as it slices yes probably unless you are picky about how toasted your toast is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends how fastslow you cut on toastiness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,excellent point if you cut too slow will the whole loaf burn up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never seen a lightsaber set things on fire in the movies but maybe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i already do that no need for any fancy schmancy technology breaking the seal after or beers is seriously comparable to an orgasm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about the fucking technology to enjoy shitting theres no fucking pleasure receptors active when youre on toilet as such jesus fucking christ
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is true just as the fable of the djinn describes as much as you may wish to change the past you inevitably come to regret the new outcome equally or more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the musical albums were frequently arranged in specific orders that would have made shuffling a hindrance to the over all experience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gee as in gee as in my chemical romance as in fredrard rolls around on floor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,back then listening to the whole album was the purpose of buying the thing longer attention spans maybe but after listening to it several times i gotta admit to actually picking up the stylus and setting it in the next groove because of that one song in the middle that was soooo boring skipping songs back then was a little more involved than just pressing a button it really is so much easier now i love it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by the time she got to new york she found a new guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a thousand miles seems pretty far but theyve got planes and trains and cars and id walk to you if i had no other way ok then walk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact that song is years old it was released as a single in may rfuckimold
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably it was based on a real person named delilah and they met a few times never dated though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,took me a minute to get this hardest i laughed all day though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i heard she up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no he was too busy singing a song about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why why why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,she sent him a tshirt though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know if she could yell loud enough to be heard from a thousand miles away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt she think it was kinda creepy back then i think i remember reading something like that but i also thought that song came out years ago and someone just pointed out that it was ago so i might be wrong about the creepy part as well im getting old edit i obviously ended up googling this fascinating piece of music history and though it seems that she did indeed find it a bit odd at first she ended up liking it and even attended the grammymtvwhatever awards with the band totally forgot which ones since i looked it up ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact the song would be about lebanon but since the prime minister was assassinated in that year they decided to change in order to avoid an international incident
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes it was partly cloudy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well heres wonderwall
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude college is literally ez mode for getting laid i got laid for being asian by a crazy weeaboo chick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a thousand miles seems pretty far though would he really walk miles and then walk more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dang i remember listening to this when i was waaaaay younger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bye bye bye
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you want to see a room full of women all get wet at the same time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i loved hitting it with the asian exchange girls no baggage because they left after a few semesters and they were always impressed by my regrettably average junk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats quite a thing to proclaim
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think that was daughters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if he wants to fall down at her down at her door
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the quote i was thinking of is from get hard with will ferrel im not sure if there is a similar quote that you are thinking of it might be daughters i only say it once was that john mayer though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the songquote from get hard that your referencing is daughters by john mayer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what was the line he said before starting the song i could probably just look it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol all im saying is the song that your referencing is daughters by john mayer not wonderwall the quote was right lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i did know it was a different song wonderwall is oasis right the situations seem similar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just like how if everybody has a gun then everyone will be safe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant fight it two
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how does she get to india what is her supporting character another cow another barn animal does she have a love interest dont leave me hanging bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a german book about a speaking cow which escapes her range with some friends after she found out they will be slaughtered and try to hide on a ship to get to india i dont know the title right now but if someone is interested i can look it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats just indian madagascar i think dreamworks makes better movies with wacky premises pixar usually makes realistic stories with a twist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alright reddit show us how many moo puns you can make
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love foreigners
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt that just a simpsons episode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,indian here cows are very respected in our culture but at the same time india is the largest exporter of beef take it up to pixar so the cow reaches india and is exported back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mooana
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a short film already exists with a similar plot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only to find out that her dreamland consists of her walking through heavy traffic all day long and her main food source being garbage and other litter from the ground source indian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think thats pretty much holy cow by david duchovny httpsbooksgooglecombooksaboutholycowhtmlidcomjrgeacaajhlen with some other wacky characters but same basic plot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that sounds pretty amazing actually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,um how about something more believable the cow escapes from a slaughterhouse in cincinnati evades capture for days and lives the rest of its life in upstate new york
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry the ruin the misconception but they eat beef in india too plus being a dairy cow also isnt that great you get impregnated your calf stolen and then milked to oblivion rinse and repeat once milk production drops then killed for meat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only to realize that people are getting slaughtered over there to save its life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relevant music video no really
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this news popped up in my feed few hours after posting this showerthought gujarat assembly passes bill that punishes cow slaughter with years jail term
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shit just got real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meta

Showerthoughts,not_removed,mommy is what uncle paul doing really murder parents will be wishing for the day where they had to explain why brandon has two daddies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,she fled the slaughter house with some animals that were just going nowhere then she learns that there are port cities from where people go to india in yuge ships so her journey is from texas to bostonnj because she is a cow pigeons that never befriended a farm animal before and just happy to travel on her back and eat fresh things htye dont understand why she wants to leave the city and she doesnt understand why they live in one city when they can just fly to wherever they want nop no love interest barry the pigeon however has a yuge crush on one of her skin patches
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a rogue butcher helps her to escape and leads her off into the sunset or so it seemed rather she was to be transported to a stud farm where she would live out her days being ravaged byold bulls but after series of events it transpired that her father bullaim neebison an ex bull champion of the arena who beat many of matador would seek revenge to have her returned to her mother in istanbull

Showerthoughts,not_removed,plot twist when she lands in india she arrives at the state of kerala which is predominantly a beef eating state in the southern most extent of the peninsula now she must travel all the way up to north india where cows are sacred and revered
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have to know as ive seen it a couple of times now and please dont take it the wrong way are you spelling huge as yuge because its a thingmemetrend or because thats the way its colloquially spelt these days

Showerthoughts,not_removed,cola tastes like diabetes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how does black taste
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well hot damn ill have to try that but just attempting to imagine it actually does seem about right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just add massive amount of sugar and a bit of fizz and youre set
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah coke usually has some mention of citrus in the ingredients
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rocket fuel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,drinkable petrol with some sugar

Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine a very dark black taste
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you cant just go around asking what black taste like thats how you get shot

Showerthoughts,not_removed,of emptiness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rocket fuel is probably better for you

Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,touché
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because everything scales down so would my vision also if i were a giant would i be able to see clearly for miles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also if youre smaller wavelengths of light would be relatively larger so you would see colors slightly differently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i were small enough for only a few photons to hit my eye would i only see a colored blotches of light
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that or just simply blind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget the guitar players
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you might be fingering wrong

Showerthoughts,not_removed,shitpost not a disease to be making dumbass remarks about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,e scnt is just fine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was originally spelled sent and came from the french sentir in the century the c got added to the word for no apparent reason so in that sense the c is silent as it wasnt originally there in the first place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,neither
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill say c since c generally gives out sound of k in this case we can assume its c which is silent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,scaiount
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but then cent is not pronounced as kent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why the word generally like car cat cut cute etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but its generally an before an e cell certificate cement census cervix cerebellum cephalopod cedar ceiling etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats pretty much what theyve been doing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the thing about deja vu is it just feels like it has happened before you never predict things when you feel deja vu its just some sort of chemical misfire in your brain triggering something associated with familiarity at least that is my understanding i am no neuroscientist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except theres a chance that you have found the absolute most compatible person with you on earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its amazing that when people find the one that person is usually always found in close proximity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called settling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont judge me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty much the clothing article that screams i didnt get up and exercise this morning i didnt even shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and most people entering academy sporting goods look to be horribly out of shape good thing you can get athletic wear in xxl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a chubby guy in a set of sweatpants and yesterdays tshirt im less likely to judge you than say hey lets order a pizza and play video games all day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sneezing is an incredibly overused joke in movies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you ever seen osmosis jones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sneezing is an important part of the waking ned devine plot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha jokes on you australia already is a lifeless wasteland
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so mad max the video game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ever read on the beach
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it wouldnt they would just restrict it to like miles around one of the major cities like they do now i mean seriously boston and dc are much much bigger areas than that but if they didnt compress the map you would be walking for hours to get anywhere and need four to six discs to hold all the content
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fallout already sucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,those people living there are just scavengers then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean with all of the mutated creatures australia has with the harsh environments thats what i mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no actually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just mean because of all the mutated creatures and terrible weather that you would have to face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,burn this man at the stake hes a blasphemer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its pre fallout in australia and how humans deal with knowing theyll all die off radiation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know what would be funny instead of horribly mutated creatures that will kill just by being within feet of you and deadly weather they portrayed australia as the land of happy tribals and fluffy bunnies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just put him in australia hell burn from the weather
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and they multiply like fucking crazy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this thought needs to go gold
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont think about it too much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless youre considering shit as hot shit which is a good thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,perhaps it is he is worth less than shit shit still has value
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre wrong he aint shit translates to he is nothing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i knew that it was a joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in england every muffin is an english muffin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all dancing in poland is pole dancing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most ovens made in china
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre actually mostly german i would think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we are opposites im right handed but i hold the phone in my right hand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a laptop ill watch porn on my other laptop and my phone are strictly no porn except for the occasional reddit nsfw post saves me a lot of paranoia whenever im attaching files copypasting and anything else remotely work related
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must be compensating for something with a phone that bulky
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i lefty my phone and righty my dick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with fish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if this was a real certification i would use it as a hiring tool and possibly require it for many positions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know about google but i certainly have that certification
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell us the journey
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a wrong notion you got there sire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can tell you firsthand that having to stop sex in order to flip to the fourth edition rules for grapples is a conplete moodkiller
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where does it say that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah he kind of unilaterally fucks entire civilizations a couple of times for what seem to be pretty arbitrary reasons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he killed millions of people who didnt believe in him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what wrong with that he gave life to humanity why cant he take it back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i meanhook me up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would also be helpful in knowing when to avoid the jehovahs witnesses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in my area of the time deliverymen dont bother knocking the other is when the package needs to be signed for i would be happy if they bothered to knock at all i hate my package just sitting outside when i could have brought it inside
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why i only answer the door on the second ring or knock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,put a note on your door ring twice for deliverys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is really weird ive moved around a lot over the years and ive never had a delivery person who didnt at least knock once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about when youre expecting company
Showerthoughts,not_removed,define a bunch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because dogs love you and theyre loyal and they sense your emotions cats will eat your eyes when you die surrounding yourself in love is coveted surrounding yourself in sociopaths is creepy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dog is too many dogs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many litter boxes do you use
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your house probably smells like one big cat shit and piss pile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats still in the okay zone imo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i let them use the carpet i want to simulate their natural environment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tbf itd be the same if they had seven dogs so the point still stands i reckon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i mean my neighbor has dogs and her house is fairly spotless however she does keep her dogs outside percent of the time and they are all trained to shit in the yard my point is that cats cant be trained like dogs can
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or an escalator
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or ladders
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called inflation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its still feels like but only gets you worth of stuff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and to the super rich feels like which is why we scoff at people spending millions on stupid shit but to them its no big deal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup the american economic system thats how you know its working
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when you want less what you have feels like more probably buddha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and some classic beastiality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would still be a show it tj right around thw corner from the donkey show
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its march
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and already annoyed with people telling them what month it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its been my experience that dogs look at their owners as their whole world cats on the other hand think everyone is their bitch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if the owner is responsible and assumes a leadership role that allows the pet to understand how it is supposed to behave and lead a balanced and healthy life if your dog thinks you are its pet you dont deserve to have a dog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the dog sees you as a pack leader or alpha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont any dogs but i have a cat and i like to think we have a father daughter relationship its like taking care of a disabled kid you dont actually need to give it attention just feed it when its hungry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre thinking of cats the greatest achievement of the cat race is thoroughly convincing us that we love being their slaves mines being adorable right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cats consider their owners as other cats and dogs consider their owners as their pack leaders
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell him to stand up for himself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre just too easy to push around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well it probably wouldnt be an anatomically correct intestine more like a symbol for it eg the heart symbol doesnt look like an actual heart but i dont see why not though the sentiment from the bottom of my heart would become a lot less endearing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this reply is golden made me laugh at am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that whole thing about the aerodynamics of a bumblebee is fake news
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah man but a pig is a loaf of bacon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah ur just gay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont need car keys to ride a horse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the funny thing is that sometimes you can put your keys in there just dont sit down once you do or it will hurt like hell i speak from personal experience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do they just put them in a sock and store them in the front
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the keys stay in the vehicle the tiny pockets are for lighters and pocket knives
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i got a fanny pack and dont use pants pockets anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair using car keys on a horse does make it run faster
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt think of that fair enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can mow a tart bitter apple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are too high sir
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and of course it would be spicy flavored pudding as lava is you know hot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but how can you have fire pudding if you dont heat your meat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can say hey its you to anyone and itd be true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well yeah

Showerthoughts,not_removed,بیماری ها و مشکلات سلامتی هاسکی اگرچه هاسکی یکی از سالم ترین نژاد های سگ می باشد ولی حتی این نژاد هم مشکلات سلامتی مخصوص به خود را دارد با آن که احتمال بروز این مشکلات برای هاسکی کم است، ولی باید از آن ها آگاه بود تا با مشکلات بعدی رو به رو نشویم عمده مشکلات هاسکی دیسپلازی لگن و مشکلات ژنتیکی است که در ادامه به آن می پردازیم البته علاوه بر این مشکلات هاسکی ها کم و بیش به مشکلات معمولی و رایج در دیگر سگ ها نیز دچار می شوند دیسپلازی لگن دیسپلازی لگن یک بیماری ژنتیک است که باعث حالت قرار گیری نا درست استخوان در مفصل لگن می شود این حالت زمانی پیش می آید که استخوان ران به درستی در محل خود در داخل لگن جای نگیرد این بیماری مادر تمام بیماری های استخوانی سگ ها می باشد و معمولاً در سگ های بزرگ سال قابل مشاهده است هر چند که این بیماری را در توله ها هم می توان مشاهده کرد معمولاً این بیماری از همان ابتدای تولد همراه توله نمی باشد و به تدریج با رشد و بزرگ شدن سگ، در طی دو سال ایجاد می شود دیسپلازی لگن معمولاً باعث تورم، درد، آرتروز لگن بخشی که دچار مشکل شده است می شود و حرکات مختلف از جمله بلند شدن، نشستن راه رفتن و بسیاری حرکات دیگر که حرکت استخوان لگن در آن ها لازم است، را دردناک می سازد دیسپلازی لگن همچنین ممکن است باعث آسیب به هر دو طرف لگن شود که در این صورت محدودیت و مشکلات همراه با آن نیز بسیار شدید تر می شود این بیماری هر دو جنس ماده و نر را مبتلا می سازد شدت بیماری نیز یکی دیگر از عوامل مهم است که می تواند شدید یا خفیف باشد نشانه های بیماری پیش از یک سالگی سگ بروز می کنند نکته مثبت در این بیماری ان است که جلوگیری از بروز دیسپلازی لگن امکان پذیر است بنیاد ارتوپدی حیوانات یا ofa طبق آمار ها اعلام کرده است که تنها درصد از هاسکی ها به این بیماری مبتلا می شوند به علاوه آن که از نظر این سازمان، نژاد هاسکی یکی از سالم ترین نژاد های سگ در این زمینه است و در میان نژاد سگ رتبه هم در ابتلا به این بیماری را دارد httpwwwpetdatair

Showerthoughts,not_removed,چطوراز گاز گرفتن سگ جلوگیری کنیم امروز می خواهیم در مورد خطرات گاز گرفتن سگ اهمیت صحیح بازی کردن و اینکه چطور جلوی رفتار ناپسند گاز گرفتن را بگیریم صحبت کنیم گازگرفتن آرام و حمله کردن سگ به دست شما کاملا طبیعی و حتی جالب است از آنجایی که توله سگ شما تنها با سگ های دیگر در ارتباط بوده است و آنها هم به طور طبیعی با گاز گرفتن با یکدیگر بازی می کنندکاملا منطقی است که او بازی کردن با شما را همانطور در نظر می گیرد ولی به مرور زمان که دندان های سگ رشد کرده و سگ قوی تر می شودگاز گرفتن های جالب تبدیل به گاز گرفتن های نا خوشایند و حتی خطرناک می شوند از آنجایی که گاز گرفتن شیوه نادرست بازی کردن است شما حتما باید به سگ تان یاد دهید که به جای بازی با دست شما با اسباب بازی هایش بازی کند بازی کردن فعالیتی سالم و طبیعی است که باعث می شود رابطه و پیوند میان شما و سگ تان محکم تر شود این کار همچنین باعث افزایش توانایی یادگیری سگ تان می شود نشستن، منتظر ماندن یادگیری ترفند های مختلف نکشیدن بند قلاده و گاز نگرفتن پیش از آنکه گاز نگرفتن را به سگ تان یاد دهید، باید به او یاد دهید فشار گاز گرفتنش را کم کند به سگ تان اجازه دهید دست تان را گاز بگیرد وقتی محکم گاز گرفت فریاد بزنید آخ در نتیجه او جا می خورد و یک لحظه دست نگه می دارد این کار را ادامه دهید و به او اجازه دهید دستتان را گاز بگیرد و هر بار که بیش از حد سفت گاز گرفت آخ بگویید تا به این شکل سگ تان متوجه شود چه میزان فشار قابل قبول و چه مقدار فشار غیر قابل قبول است زمانی که سگ تان متوجه بازخورد و واکنش شما در مقابل گاز گرفتنش را فهمید می توانید کاهش میزان فشار گاز گرفتن را شروع کنید بهترین روش برای آموزش گاز نگرفتن به سگ این است که نظر او را به یک اسباب بازی یا استخوان جویدنی جلب کنید هر وقت سگ تان چیز نادرستی را گاز گرفت محکم به او نه بگویید و آن وسیله را با اسباب بازی یا وسیله دیگر که سگ تان مجاز به گاز گرفتنش است تعویض کنید اگر سگ تان تا ماه سن دارد ممکن است در حال دندان در آوردن باشد و بخواهد با گاز گرفتن این حس ناخوشایندش را از بین ببرد می توانید به او یک قالب یخ برای جویدن بدهید این کار باعث بی حس شدن لثه ها و تسکین درد می شود روش مورد علاقه من برای بازداری از گاز گرفتن سگ، اغراق و تظاهر به اینکه او من را یعنی دوستش را زخمی کرده می باشد تظاهر کنید گاز گرفتن او باعث آسیب رسیدن به شما شده است دستتان را بکشید بگویید آخ و بازی کردن را متوقف کنید در واقع شما همان کاری را تکرار می کنید که دیگر سگ های هم بازی هنگام احساس درد از خود نشان می دادند کنترل و مدیریت گاز گرفتن سگ برای پرورش دوست داران سگ می تواند بسیار مشکل و چالش برانگیز باشد گاز گرفتن سگ ابتدا جالب است ولی برای جلوگیری از مشکلات بعدی باید سریعا جلوی آن را بگیرید آموزش سگ وابسته به رابطه خوب بر پایه اعتماد و دوستی است ایجاد یک دوستی زمان می برد و هر چه بیشتر شما صبر داشته باشید سگ تان فرمان پذیر تر خواهد شد سگ ها دوست دارند رضایت شما را جلب کنند httpwwwpetdatair
Showerthoughts,not_removed,خرید سگ هاسکی خرید سگ هاسکی اگر قصد خرید و انتخاب یک سگ هاسکی را دارید احتمالاً با ویژگی های رفتاری، طریقه نگهداری، بهداشت، بیماری ها، آموزش و بسیاری از مسائل بزرگ و کوچک این نژاد آشنایی دارید اگر چنین نیست حتماً قبل از انتخاب و تصمیم گیری، مقالات مرتبط را مطالعه کنید اول تعهد زمانی خرید یک سگ به معنای تعهد در قبال مراقبت از او برای باقی عمرش است پس بهتر است ریز و بزرگ نکات را در نظر داشته تا در این امر موفق باشید شما باید آینده خود را تا حد امکان پیش بینی کنید و بر طبق آن تصمیم گیری کنید دقت داشته باشید که این تعهد زمانی برای سگ های هاسکی سال است بنابر این پیش از آن که یک هاسکی بخرید باید به آینده خود فکر کنید و ببینید تا سال ، سال و نهایتاً سال بعد، چه وضعیتی خواهید داشت دوم سگ بزرگ سال یا توله بسیاری از مردم تصور می کنند که بزرگ کردن توله هاسکی باعث ایجاد رابطه قوی تر و صمیمانه تر میان آن ها می گردد در حالی که این وضعیت در مورد هاسکی ها صدق نمی کند درست است که تربیت و رابطه مداوم میان صاحب و سگ در کنار آموزش و تمرینات مرتب و مناسب باعث ایجاد رابطه بهتر می شود ولی همان طور که تمام پرورش دهندگان هاسکی می گویند ایجاد رابطه با یک سگ بزرگ سال تفاوت چندانی با ایجاد رابطه با توله هاسکی ندارد خصوصیات مثبت و منفی سگ هاسکی خصوصیات رفتارمثبت » هاسکی ها بسیار باهوش هستند و قابلیت بالایی در حل مشکل دارند » بیشتر هاسکی ها سگ هایی بسیار مردم دوست هستند و سگ های خانوادگی بسیار خوبی هستند » هاسکی های سیبریایی ورزشکاران خوبی هستند و شریک ایده آلی برای پیاده روی یا دویدن در هوای سرد می باشند » هاسکی ها معمولاً حس شوخ طبعی بالایی دارند و زیاد پیش می آید که سر به سر صاحب خود بگذارند » هاسکی ها سگ هایی زیبا و با ظاهری بسیار جذاب هستند » هاسکی ها بسیار پر انرژی و فعال هستند خصوصیات رفتارمنفی » هاسکی ها غریزه شکار بالایی دارند و معمولاً تمایل به دنبال کردن حیوانات کوچک تر مثل گربه ها دارند حتی هاسکی هایی که در داخل خانه با حیوانات خانگی دیگر زندگی می کنند نیز ممکن است در خارج از خانه رفتاری متفاوت بروز داده و به دیگر حیوانات آسیب برسانند » سگ های هاسکی زمانی که قلاده ندارند ممکن است به حرف شما گوش ندهند حتی هاسکی های تربیت شده بنابر این هیچ گاه نباید بدون قلاده و طناب باشند » محل نگهداری سگ هاسکی باید به خوبی محافظت شده باشد و راه فرار نداشته باشد » هاسکی ها سگهای تمیزی هستند ولی ریزش موی شدید دارند » رفتار دوستانه دارند ولی نگهبان خوبی نیستند » پرانرژی و پر شور هستند ولی تحمل انزوای طولانی مدت را ندارند اگر این مشکلات را دارید سگ هاسکی نخرید قطعاً هیچ کدام ازما دوست نداریم که به دلیل انتخاب اشتباه یک سگ بی گناه را از داشتن یک زندگی خوب و خوش محروم کرده و خود و سگمان را آزار دهیم پس بهتر است به این نباید ها توجه کنیم » سگ های هاسکی حتماً باید در کنار سگ های دیگر یا در کنار اعضای دیگر خانواده باشند بنابر این اگر شرایط زندگی شما به گونه ای است که مجبور هستید کل روز را کار کنید و فقط فضای کافی برای یک سگ را دارید بهتر است از خرید هاسکی خود داری کنید » اگرچه سگ هاسکی با خانواده و صاحب خود بسیار سریع خو می گیرد ولی رفتار کلی سگ هاسکی با همه دوستانه است پس اگر سگی می خواهید که فقط و فقط به شما وفادار باشد شاید بهتر باشد در انتخاب خود بیشتر دقت کنید » ظاهر این سگ ممکن است بسیاری را به اشتباه بیندازد ولی واقعیت آن است که هاسکی ها سگ های نگهبان خوبی نیستند چرا که رفتار آن ها تقریباً با همه و حتی غریبه ها نیز دوستانه است بنابر این اگر یک سگ نگهبان می خواهید هاسکی سگ شما نیست » تمام هاسکی های سیبریایی حداقل سالی یک بار ریزش مو دارند و شدت آن نیز در طول آن دوره زیاد است پس اگر خیلی به منظم و تمیز بودن خانه حساس هستید ممکن است هاسکی بهترین گزینه برای شما نباشد » هاسکی ها متخصصین فرار هستند و عادت به کندن زمین دارند بنابر این اگر باغچه یا گل در حیات خود کاشته اید، باید بدانید که هاسکی ها چندان اهمیتی به آن نمی دهند httpwwwpetdatair
Showerthoughts,not_removed,سگ سیبرین هاسکی ورزشکاران حرفه ای هستند سگ سیبرین هاسکی ها ذاتاً ورزشکار هستند آن ها نیاز به ورزش و تحرک بسیار دارند و صاحب آن ها باید به صورت روزانه وقت مشخصی را صرف کار با آن ها کند البته این موضوع را نباید با نیاز به داشتن فضای زیاد اشتباه گرفت یعنی آن که نیاز به فعالیت و ورزش زیاد لزوماً به معنی نیاز به فضای باز و بزرگ نمی باشدهاسکی ها را می توان در یک فضای کوچک مثلاً در حیاتی که توسط فنس احاطه شده است، تمرین داد یا حتی می توان انرژی و هیجان زیاد آن ها را با قدم زنی های روزانه پاسخ داد البته با تمام این اوصاف، باز هم باید گفت که هاسکی برای یک زندگی آپارتمان نشینی مناسب نیست یکی از راه کارهایی که می توان برای سرگرم کردن و تخلیه انرژی هاسکی سیبریایی به کار گرفت در واقع داشتن دو عدد هاسکی است حضور هاسکی ها در کنار یکدیگر به پر کردن اوقات فراغت و بر طرف کردن نیاز به فعالیت و سرگرمی، کمک می کند البته داشتن دو سگ الزامی نیست، ولی کاملاً مشخص است که حضور یک سگ بازیگوش دیگر برای هاسکی بسیار ارزشمند است اگر توانایی نگهداری از دو سگ را به صورت هم زمان دارید بهتر است این کار را انجام دهید می توانید از کسانی که این کار را کرده اند سؤال کنید داشتن دو سگ هاسکی به صورت هم زمان، مانند تماشای یک مسابقه است آنها مرتباً با هم بازی می کنند و به دنبال همدیگر می دوند چه کسی از دیدن یک مسابقه هیجان انگیز زنده بدش می اید چنان چه سگ دومی در کار نباشد شما به عنوان صاحب سگ باید همیشه برای بازی و ورزش گوش به زنگ باشیداگر به داشتن یک سگ هاسکی قناعت می کنید باید به این نکته توجه داشته باشید که سگ های هاسکی همیشه راهی برای سرگرم کردن خود پیدا می کنندخواه آن که این سرگرمی دویدن و فرار کردن باشد و خواه آنکه به هم ریختن خانه و وسایل خود به یک تفریح تبدیل شود، بالأخره آن ها خود و شما را مشغول نگه می دارند بنابر این بهتر است که دست پیش را بگیرید از آن ها در انجام کارهای روزانه کمک استفاده کنید و همیشه آن ها را سرگرم و شاداب نگه دارید httpwwwpetdatair
Showerthoughts,not_removed,سگ هاسکی رژیم غذایی می گیرد تعجب نکنید سگ هاسکی برخلاف انرژی و فعالیت بسیار هاسکی ها به نسبت دیگر نژاد های هم اندازه خود به غذای کمتری نیاز دارند برخی از آن ها حتی مراقب مقدار خوراک روزانه خود هم هستند این ویژگی احتمالاً از نژاد اصیل سگ های هاسکی در قبیله چاکچی ناشی شود مردم قبیله چاکچی از سگ های خود برای کشیدن بار در فواصل طولانی و دمای بسیار پایین استفاده می کردند و غذای کمی هم به آنها می دادند بنابر این اگر هاسکی شما علاقه زیادی به غذا نشان نمی دهد یا حتی گاهاً غذای خود را نمی خورد نباید زیاد تعجب کنید علی رغم نیاز به غذای کم هاسکی نسبت به غذای خود نسبتاً حساس است و هر غذایی را نمی خورد کیفیت غذای هاسکی از اهمیت بالایی برخوردار است آن ها یک رژیم غذایی متعادل پر پروتئین و پر چرپ را می پسندند که بسیاری از غذاهای معمولی سگ چنین ویژگی هایی را ندارد پس بهتر است از یک متخصص در مورد رژیم غذایی آن ها سؤال کنید و مقالات تخصصی در مورد تغذیه هاسکی را مطالعه فرمایید در انتها باید چند نکته مهم که مستقیماً با ویژگی پر انرژی بودن هاسکی ها نشأت می گیرد را ذکر کنیم » هاسکی هیچ گاه نباید بدون قلاده و طناب بیرون برده شوند مهم نیست چقدر سگ تان را آموزش داده اید چرا که غریزه و هیجان برای دویدن نهایتاً بر او غلبه می کند » هاسکی نباید با کودکان تنها باشد انرژی زیاد هاسکی ها باعث می شود آن ها چندان قابل پیش بینی نباشند httpwwwpetdatair

Showerthoughts,not_removed,or you know open up a biology book
Showerthoughts,not_removed,especially forbidden foods
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they might not actually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no because a telekinetic doesnt read minds he moves objects or exerts force to read minds you have to be a telepath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,telekinetics can move objects telepaths can read minds and the answer depends on whether telepathy would connect to a thought at a prelanguage level or only read conscious thoughts when you are hungry for example only rarely do you think in words i am hungry most of the time you react to the impulse without it having words whether a telepath could read such thoughts or only empaths could is a question for authors and rpgs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure you mean telepathic ability not telekinetic and no you wouldnt need to learn new languages you would understand the thoughts in your native tongue regardless of the other persons language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you use telekinesis on another human mind there will not be any mind left to hold thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess im my parents son and dont know english too xd hides in shame yeah i meant telepathic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but how would you know that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,anyway imho it depends for more complicated thoughts youd need to learn the language otherwise superficial thoughts might be perceived as images sounds or sensations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they dont have to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im going to cry no matter the result
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always said i will most likely end up in jail heading to wrigleyville tomorrow at noon and going to try my best to avoid that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hence why i mostly ignore many emotional events i dont like myself but i put efforts to do good to everyone else if someone close to me died i would not mourn and carry on because theres nothing else to do unless revival is possible which i would then pursue but i keep myself from not dying so that others do not get sad for me i dont want to stop others from being sad thats their right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is probably dependant on the person

Showerthoughts,not_removed,nothing is ever good enough for us we always have to push to that next step
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a way its a necessary drive to ingenuity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no one can compete in any water events because the water is disgusting

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i prefer a bar at the bottom of the hill over one at the top of the hill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i set my bar low at alcoholism

Showerthoughts,not_removed,the water is softer and you have a harder time washing it off you must be living on the west coast somewhere california even the water is hard and not very good for showers

Showerthoughts,not_removed,what companies still talk about loyalty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when companies talk about being like a community being like a family or use terms like loyalty or respect they mean we want the benefits of those concepts without any of the negatives a firm is in no way like a family do you know why you cannot fire your mom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really theres like a million stars for every person probably more

Showerthoughts,not_removed,good pun ha ha nice one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my puns are usually accidental
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when someone makes a good pun i ask them if they want their body to be found in years or
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or a look a pure derision
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was so bad it was good

Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a meat eater but i would argue its worse for chickens cows and sheep they spend their whole lives being taken care of by humans and then one day the humans kill and eat them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its ok fish dont have souls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if the shower is where brilliant ideas like this are created you should probably stop showering
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if they become criminals once out of their job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some even go so far as to commit crimes themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,super criminals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,creating new job opportunities for their colleagues
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure any plumbers here would rather fix the sink than unclog the bog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wearing s logo bearing suit with underwear on the outside
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this post must have had inspiration whats the story what made you feel like someone thought they were a know it all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,duct is derived from the latin word for channel or stream ie aqueduct since duct tape was originally meant to be used for holding wires in place or separate from others it inherited the name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how about it being used on a duck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have used it on ducts before but to be honest its not the best as it can deteriorate after a few years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,interesting note that came later and as others have stated it is not the best option due to deterioration and slipping due to glue softening
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apparently theres a study on this and what you said is true quoting from this page the physical properties of a color may be different for different people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and what if the colour that everyone pick as their favourite colour is just the same colour we call it different names like blue black or whatever but its just only one colour that we all humans like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey guys its this thread again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if this exact thing wasnt reposted every hour
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know its funny ive been on reddit for almost years and i dont think ive ever seen this question what i have seen however is at least person in every single ask reddit or showethoughs thread complaining about having already seen a similar post you might say that these people are the biggest reposters of all since this complaint gets brought up probably hundreds of time a day and they dont even have the excuse that they havent seen it because its everywhere instead of bypassing the offending post and going about their day they seem to feel the need to make reposters of themselves by going into someone elses thread and bitching about having already seen the topic one might begin to wonder if these people really have so little going on in their lives that shouting repost from the mountain tops is the only way they can feel important
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpwwwyoumadbronetyoumadbrojpg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the end of django unchained he does doughnuts on a horse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no its not how that works haha its not like an antibiotic where its killing a germ its instead altering the chemistry in the brain but because its not trying to kill the creature theres no natural push to evolve a tolerance plus humans evolve so slow itd take hundreds of thousands of years to see if it worked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you hyphen a good time up there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my wife has built up tolerances to many antidepressants so maybe it could
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hope so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if the people you see are siblings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then their parents must have had sex at least twice unless theyre twins then they count as the same person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,has nothing to do with program but how stable your connection to the source
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this just made me realize it does that so it can cover up the installation process within the download or else people get mad if they have to download and install it just a thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must be a windows user yes i use osx
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can also learn stuff by whats not in their browsing history every single day they stop browsing reddit from to guess thats when they go incognito mode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then other mes are dicks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but maybe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you have a source on that so many people for the most part people ive come across dont seem to mind them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,may the blood of the nonbeliever run red in the streets waaahhhhhhaaaa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they should at least some of them the satanic temple absolutely deserves to be taken seriously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its pronounced water temple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the videos i watch dont have a lot of that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what mute is for i may listen to them talk once or twice but sound is not why i watch pornos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you talking about the promosplash screen music before the actual video begins or the music that accompanies the actual video either way the answer is no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whhaaat the fake moaning is where its at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fake moaning is a huge turn off lol it gotta be real for it to be a pleasurable experience lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was sarcasm bro i watch amateur shit for that reason
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ohhhh my bad my bad😂😂im a female btwbro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok man whatever you say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you sure its not a double v
Showerthoughts,not_removed,double v for sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is in german
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ya ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did op check to see if this had been posted times before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he stole this mindblowing question from a friend but he also searched it on shower thoughts and nothing appeared
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck the gorilla fuck the parents fuck the king
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why didnt they just use a tranquilizer instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if the gorilla would have killed the boy the zoo would have most likely had to put the gorilla down anyway the mother if proven negligent then she should be charged for child endangerment and the death of the gorilla
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i blame the parents for not keeping a close eye on their child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that gorilla was part of an endangered species that we put on display for our amusement not the same as killing a bug in the wild we imprisoned him for our own selfish means and put seperate deterrents for people to stay away we have a responsibility to treat that animal better the kid got past all without his mother watching this was a crime and the gorilla was an innocent who died because of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn straight now lets throw that tea into the bay and show them fucks whose boss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would have been to dangerous since he could have gotten frightened and killed the boy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they dont work immediately animals can react aggressively before they actually get knocked out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people like you make me so fucking angry you think that people went out into the jungle found some endangered gorilla conked it over the head with a baseball bat and dragged it back to the united states so we could charge someone to look at it thats not what zoos are do some fucking research before you spout shit off on the internet with no clue what youre talking about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so rather kill the innocent child instead of the innocent gorilla
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude first of all you dont know me i watched the small documentary on his life he was born at that zoo in cincinnati raised his whole life there in fact the point remains the same he was in an enclosed space his whole life and when something he had only seen through a glass wall came into his area he got excited if you locked up a man from birth in a house and yhen introduced a dog after so many years the man would be overly excited too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so no he wasnt imprisoned for our own selfish means he was born in the zoo and therefore incapable of surviving on his own in the wild
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why was he born there at one point we captured his ancestor and locked him up we still have a responsibility to keep him safe so what if a child falls in there billion people and according to the world wildlife foundations website gorillias of his kind left fuck it shoot the kid we have more than enough to spare
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i kill myself in the woods am i actually dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if a man goes into the woods alone is he still wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah it smells like fucking shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks this is really great from now on whenever there isa block chordim going to wind up with my hand over my head

Showerthoughts,not_removed,just because the mosquito might be a bit of a prick that doesnt mean we cant call it a mosquito bite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so youre going to say you have a mosquito prick when you get pricked by a mosquito
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you get pricked by bees as a kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mosquito doesnt actually bite with its teeth so why not

Showerthoughts,not_removed,then does this mean young and old are the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well normal is sort of just whatever sounds right so if you only ever talk after inhaling helium then yes oxygen makes your voice lower than normal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats normal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey if its something the person likes then why not if its just to keep your place in a book you could use your receipt from the gas station
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but we are on earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never been one for religion and stuff but ive always felt like we borrow our bodies from the earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this right now youre on earth and of earth when youre on mars youre on mars but still of earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh no willy didnt make it and he crushed our boy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,show me mj
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sound travels pretty slowly even if everyone was on beat depending on the size if the crowd you might hear it late
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt that just
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and u dont wonder what u r being served when someone says enjoy your fooddrink
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i am in airplane in my mind it says fly faster bitch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,implying thats not what i do already and i have the added bonus of not being employed by buzzfeed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,buzzfeed creating jobs for communication majors since
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the chive is even easier they dont even change the titles of the posts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,inspired by the olympic logopost arent ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yahoo news also steals a lot of material from reddit too i make sure not to click it so they cant profit from it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont even need to bother with the souces either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some stay on reddit all day just for the sweet karma and the others to make millions of dollars though choice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i find a lot of cheezburger facebook posts based on raskreddit posts as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the lad bible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey my work is like that anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre goddamm right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the nsa should also be like browsing reddit all day you know for the safety of the people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it seems like all youd have to do is browse hashtags and topics and copy and paste those into a buzzfeed article
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so many burns in one place youre all gonna start a fire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i really should just start making posts on ifunny just look at the front page of reddit and post everything there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre good at something never do it for free
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my sister for offered a job at buzzfeed she turned it down
Showerthoughts,not_removed,buzzfeed is pretty much a reddit and tumblr aggregate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im browsing reddit at work right now and i bet most of my co workers have at some point today too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,honestly all the major media outlets are just as guilty if its on reddit today itll be posted on their fbtwitter page the next day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plot twist youre unemployed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,added bonus employed by buzzfeed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know a single communication major that holds buzzfeed in high esteem ive had family send me links saying this is totally you you should work for them my reaction is always this silent disappointment its like how the mainstream sees mechanics or it people or lawyers were not like in the tv shows
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my favorite job drugs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely correct my good sir
Showerthoughts,not_removed,between you and marissa mayer yahoo is done for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with yahoo its not so much a matter of stealing as just not knowing that that isnt how the web works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,welcome to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we got oharalaniqua and midwaytonia here in the chi so sounds about right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive yet to meet one is it popular to name kids after former mayors where youre from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a new york minute is according to einsteins theory of relativity shorter at the top of the tallest skyscraper than at the bottom of the deepest subway tunnel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wrong you only simultaneously love and hate it until you think about it when the entanglement degenerates into you either loving it or hating it but i agree with the others here not a physics student are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre not studying physics are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,definitely not a physics student
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha no not a physics student did very basic newtonian physics years back yet this does perfectly express what its like you only simultaneously love and hate it until you think about it when the entanglement degenerates into you either loving it or hating it so although it was a poor example it did lead to perfect understanding on your part is this not the purpose of communication edit stupid autocorrect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nailed it spot on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by the way gotta love autocorrect always there for you when you dont need it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah what if
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes serving a dime in chino for exposing himself to kids at the ymca pool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a this subreddit very clearly states no punswordplay in the sidebar b that doesnt even fucking work as a pun or wordplay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we dont even know what were missing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no data limitscap theres no such thing reminds me of when peter griffin won free gas for a year he flew a rocket
Showerthoughts,not_removed,american networks feel like a world country to you really we americans are supposed to be the cocky snobs looking down upon other cultures it does not become you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know we swedes might chirp you guys at hockey but your internet is insane and straight up cheating
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well some of you are wealthy the vast majority rely on debt so as long as debt keeps flowing youre okay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they already have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,amputees
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my grandmother shrank inches in old age
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont tell me how to live my life knee implants are a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about cotton hill

Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the shower ew
Showerthoughts,not_removed,prince got more poon than you or i will ever see including from pornography seen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,english isnt my first language why are you taking dicks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,huh i always thought he was gay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do you mean by pornography seen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,welcome to memes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he mentions eating pussy in a bunch of different songs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that he has had sex with more vaginas than we will see including those vaginas that we see by watching pornography
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt underestimate redditors here man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey thats what im doing right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just think sexy thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let me know if you have any pointers

Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup drugs work every time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant imagine my dog saying pardon me sir may i please get by as he shoves past me bolting mph toward a squirrel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,excuse me master but this is an urgent matter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats cold
Showerthoughts,not_removed,little food for thought i left the country i grew up in and didnt remain in contact with anyone but had them on facebook i recently had to return for reasons not relevant and some of those people on my facebook were willing to house me and feed me as i made my way around just because they felt they were still a part of my life even though i hadnt thought of them even fleetingly in nearly a decade
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why dont you punch their dog while youre at it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where did you go thats pretty cool of them to do for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not that much of a jerk cmon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i grew up in england moved to illinois then had to move back to england and am about to move back to illinois
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just kidding d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,interesting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably because she died in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but by now her son john would already be a great military leader
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mission accomplished
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they just need to come out with a wonderbro to make my balls look plump
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont always sit on my balls but when i do im wearing boxers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but as a woman they do look far better on a man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bras are like boxer briefs for your br nah nevermind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in years when people are speaking to millenial spirits itll be like that spirit are you there lol ye im theyre whats it like where you are lots of doggos n shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,spirit are you there ys yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol that is the least of your worries
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and yet people still fail to extrapolate from that thought and continue expecting ancient mythology to solve their problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gfycat urls are almost funnier then the content
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you just assume his kong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,his name was an afterthought top billing on the game was always going to go to the gorilla kong in the context was more or less a given donkey was found by consulting a japaneseenglish dictionary for a word meaning silly or stupid the protagonist was simply called jumpman for the one thing he was good at source
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stores it was an arcade game first im calling rbullshit on your comment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre right its just a urban legend i heard on youtube
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpwwwsnopescombusinessmisxlatedonkeykongasp
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah still totally believable seeing how the name of the game does not really make sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i trust people that feel it necessary to say that less
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which is how you become mature i cant be friends with those guys because their music sucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes its sad but other times it teaches you who you can really trust and who you just cant makes you realize that people out there only look for you because they want drama and nothing else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,any sufficiently large site contains porn tumblr yep instagram yep newsgrounds yep reddit definitely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because its a porn site
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is porn here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now you have to create a youtube channel good luck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont worry thanks to common usage they will both be considered correct soon enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but i now is a really strange grammatical construct its not wrong but but now i is so much smoother
Showerthoughts,not_removed,itll be about people hacking into the cars then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,car movies will be the new westerns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the slow and the steady
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyll be about vin diesel outrunning ugv police cars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt this a movie already i think it was titled cars s
Showerthoughts,not_removed,raskreddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really interested in a full deconstruction of the concept just came across my mind a shower thought can be interrogative
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends on what theyre talking about ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not necessarily i have a body builder friend who would take that as a compliment he has put a lot of effort into building his muscles that its well earned praise though i wont tell him that gotta keep him humble
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as you become an elder its much more of a compliment when you didnt use viagra
Showerthoughts,not_removed,offensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tom jong cruise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i enjoy thinking about what if s were right all along it exercises openmindedness a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that one hair is the like the cherry on top of the sundae
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont fucking say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah humanity wait wait scratch that doh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,futurama did that i believe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would be insanely cost prohibitive launching something into space is not cheap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nobody cares about uranus either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with a catapult this is why we need trump as president hed build a catapult and launch the garbage along with hillary into saturn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why you tie a string around the moon and just winch it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or jewpiter sorry that joke was offensive even for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,into saturn cause no one gives a shit about saturn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the muslims
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see no one else seems to care i was just reheating some beef commercial and i was deeply entranced by the microwave
Showerthoughts,not_removed,android has that widget its on the far right of your apps pages
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i thought then i found a really nice app that always displays indepth statistics about your data usage each month week day its called my data manager for android
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tmobile one brohomie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my provider does this but it is a day or two behind i daresay intentionally
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know if your on telstra plan you get one thats somewhat accurate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,android is pretty much open source feel free to create it and became a millionaire easy money lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always assumed golly weed was good for a few kicks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they already can see paintings that talk flying brooms and white apparitions that pass through walls why would they need drugs also wizard drugs would probably be way better than weed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre above that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they go from amateur to professional in matter of seconds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no repeat showings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not much room for a promotion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all you have to do is say the magic words allah akbar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all that means is god is great greatest first etc there are quite a few translations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because they sign a contract if youre just hired you can quit or be fired with no ramifications
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you forgot athletes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and musicians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if using rreddit has turned you into a crazy person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let me guess youre also white i bet you think you deserve elastic bands while the rest of us have to work for them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i only get one rubber band a year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt influence whether to buy or not but it does influence whether to get full tank or half or even lower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,congratulations you are not poor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gotta love inelasticity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people always bitch about gas prices but im not going to let pennies on the mile influence my driving i remember one year a friend was losing his shit because gas was back up to but it was the year before and my sister would drive across town because an app told her shed save a gallon at one station
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same my gf has a also habit of shopping around for the best price if you save cents a gallon and fill gallons congratulations you saved cents go you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course not but as it rises i bet you try to make fewer or shorter trips
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the rising price of epipens hasnt stopped people from having them unless poor as mentionef in other comments you need it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a tie is a loss for both parties and before you try to argue it no it is not a win for anyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its just as hard to lose at coinflips at is is to win mr obvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what about the trophy i got for losing in second grade
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats captain obvious to you young one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre talking about the one that said congratulations youre a fucking loser you can keep it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as if there would only be one way to say it httplmgtfycomqmrobvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now go book a room at hotelscom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oooooooh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is a thing on android
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most definitely is a thing on android
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on ios settings general keyboards turn autocorrect off does exactly what you want youre welcome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my phone does that httpmimgurcompipilfs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wat purpis woud taht surv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in android this feature not only exists but even if you leave autocorrect on you can tap any word youve already written and it gives you a list of alternative autocorrect options
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats exactly how i have my phone set up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,swiftkey does that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,iphone does that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my phone has it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,iphone does this too you dont even have to change any settings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,must be an iphone user
Showerthoughts,not_removed,windows phone represent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would end the struggle of sending a message that makes absolutely no sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this wer my eggzact thats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i sea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,icy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are they horrible tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not like that because it is true the other kids get to go home to loving families while the clowns go home to lonely apartment w an empty fridge its true they want attention and its sad they dont get it at home but why would you verbablly take something thats true and use it as an insult
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive actually never heard that phrase before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whut
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its a malaprop combining is the pope catholic and does a bear shit in the woods
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does the pope shit on a bear
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wow i never thought about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thing is web designers make the website and sell it to the client not actually own the site themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish i could access the universe where this exists i would love to see a lighthearted comedy parodying the the occasional in show characters watching that show like how cool would it be to come back from commercial to a scene seen with them gathered around a television just to hear the iconic little jam outro thingies show had before their commercial breaks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if only i had the money to produce this or some cosmic access to the multiverse i need this in my life oh my god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,drink vanilla
Showerthoughts,not_removed,avongelism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol the irony hell drain the swamp alright and the flood is going to wash away the benefits and the pocket change of the working class
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as someone not from america presumably the origin of this phrase it doesnt make sense anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,those are really people desperate but feeling beings the more empty people in my mind are the johns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think i have to remind you that youre talking about human beings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,prostitutes are human beings theyre not meat and theyre not synthetic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how high are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,time is only relative to where you are in your given galaxysolar system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,time existed long before we defined or quantified it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now nowjust let it sink in and really think about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but our definition of it is not a description of a thing its a definition of a concept without saying what it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a thing can be a concept time certainly isnt a physical thing but its still a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then why is it inconsistent and variable depending your relative observation of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that doesnt make it not a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but also calling something a thing does not necessarily make it anything more than a conceptif you have a magic box that you can take everything out of matterenergytemperaturethere would still be what we perceive as time in the box you cant remove a concept
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you need to define what you mean by thing you could say that democracy is a concept freedom is a concept but time is a real thing its what keeps everything from happening at once certain events happened in the universe before other events regardless of whether or not mankind ever came along if time were not a thing then the universe would have no before or after
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe it doesnt have a start or endthats interesting to think about tks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well thats something that will make your head explode if you try to figure it out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,technically youre never touching anything you can hold something but on a molecular level you arent actually in contact with that item
Showerthoughts,not_removed,another brilliant observation captain obvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jump
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im always touching your mom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but on a molecular level you objects and even touching are all meaningless concepts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you certified pig fucker
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hed be touching air tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is my dilemma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the thing is if you are naked in the vacuum of space for the few seconds that you survive would you be touching something can you consider parts of your body as something youre touching well never know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,define touching something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called the reno air races
Showerthoughts,not_removed,red bull air race a yearly global competition
Showerthoughts,not_removed,planes would be a lot harder to fit on the track
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought red bull sponsored a plane racing league sometime back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it should be called nasky
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cause nascars shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,national association for planes nap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so youre thinking about jedis nut tapping each other in the shower hmmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and syth probably force nut all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or people who live in deserts az here its like here and people are droping like flies from the heat winter means more out door stuff atleast for my self
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its winter now and usage is still huge
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just cant wait until fall when kids have to go to school bwahahaha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never underestimate the heart of pokemon goers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if the developers are smart and make a ton of rare ice types show up regularly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,think of all the great writers who had no access to printing presses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,looking at the first years of phone networks and the complexities of switch boards one can only imagine what those engineers could have done with access to todays computers and the internet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,those wooden teeth made him a cinch with the computers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he was still a great president
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this post sucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont worry i saw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive been thinking this for thirty years i dropped a bar right on the edge and it flawlessly skated across the tub launched in the air and i simply reached out and grabbed it i cant catch a beach ball from six feet away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please describe and rate the catch so we can fully appreciate ops skills in the shower also please rate any other skills demonstrated by op
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are supposed to go top down like a car so the dirt doesnt run over the clean areas duh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,evolution doesnt work that way unless you believe in a form of creation obligatory rational reddit asshole commenter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,adam and eve
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont feed the troll
Showerthoughts,not_removed,um no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont think thats quite how it works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,explain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if that were true then every time you werent touching the floor whatever object behind you would fly mph at you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if the earth span at we would all be dead or extremely dizzy lol nice try though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true if we werent also traveling at but we also are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okso when i drive in a car am i actually going like your logic is garbage lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kilometers per second thus the surface of the earth at the equator moves at a speed of meters per secondor roughly miles per hour as schoolchildren we learn that the earth is moving about our sun in a very nearly circular orbit it covers this route at a speed of nearly kilometers per second or miles per hour
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you seem extra determined to not listen or not believe people when theyre answering your questions very clearly and logically
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you have a number for earths rotation speed then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no but lets say i run the opposite direction earth is spinning according to you i wouldnt be able to move foward unless i ran at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because the atmosphere the land everything on the earth is spinning at that rate you dont need to go mph because you already are to go you only need more mph
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also we dont feel the rotation of the earth but that doesnt we arent moving at the speed because everything else moves with us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a pretty fun uncle though or the irresponsible best friend to the groom around for comedic effect in a romcom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,story of my life here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no youre not you default to assuming youre interesting and after a long enough time of people telling you that you arent you get used to it by and large youre uninteresting like the rest of us but sometimes you get a good idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah i dont think you want that if she has strong kegels youd get ejected
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude great idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why be anxious if she really cares about you shes honest with that kinda stuff faking it just encourages the significant other to do the exact same thing over and over again as it made you come and that results in overall bad sex instead of faking it tell your partner what youre into
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont do a lot of do you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but then you couldnt tell if shes pleased or just has a coldallergy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uhwhen a girl has a real orgasm its very obvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im primed and ready for blastoff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,communication is key after all i have to agree with you there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not entirely sure what a specific position has to do with it honestly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure you think strippers actually like you too huh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats cute
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you want a girl sneezing all over your cock or possibly biting it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a girlfriend who happened to be a stripper but i never saw her perform really didnt want tosure she liked me but other than that ive never had sex with a stripper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can handle a sneeze not sure my member can handle a bite though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my point is lying or feigning isnt all that difficult
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im starting to think you never gave a woman an orgasm its really obvious there are muscle spasms and everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mate every girl is different not all of them have muscle spasms or obvious signs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure never ever i can flex my dick too doesnt mean im finishing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except when the lion takes down the other gazelle thats trying to kill you then asks if youre ok lovely analogy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a lyin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i connected with my boss on linkedin did i mess up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only if you also found your gf on tinder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,based on what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think this is true and in fact i bet if a poll was ran it would be quite the opposite its openly acceptable to hate on weirdos with sex dolls if you hate on gay people you lose your job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say thats a fair statement now did you wash the fleshlight before you got out of the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude i never thought about that id love to see some actual poll numbers id bet youre right and that is so fucked up id also like to know the difference in attitudes about men doing it than women
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where did you hear thatsex is for procreation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nonhuman love dolls like those mlp dolls with the backside pocket
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually they are both taboo weirdos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do whatever you like just dont try to tell the rest of us how we are to think knock yourself out and enjoy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is the diff between a plastic doll and another man or a monkey for that matter i dont get it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i said many not most
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually i paint my toenails and make my feet look feminine so i can ejaculate on them i have no need for a fleshlight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know right apparently being the right gender is more important than being animate and having a conscious sense of self
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sex if for fun breeding is for procreation i like to have sex with womens feet certainly no offspring will be produced there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if i put the sex toy inside another man and then fuck it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow you even capitalized taboo honestly the only taboo i care about is the one against cousins being able to have romantic relationships its a corporate construction intended to generate profits in the industries that support dating and the culture of searching for a mate cousins are often from compatible backgrounds and are biologically suitable mates
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would you want me to tell you how to think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well its tough to get consent from a monkey otherwise im totally with you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i got what i came for thats a wrap for me zip in up and zip it out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,livin up to that username
Showerthoughts,not_removed,edited nice try though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what was it you think i was trying exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude this is so boring please fuck off and boil your head or something i mean that in the nicest possible way of course
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no offense taken i appreciate your courtesy what exactly are you saying is boring please forgive my confusion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ehatever uou want to think is fine by me dude discourse overif it could be called that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whatever i want to think about what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good idea for rwritingprompts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they probably would for science youd probably be miserable everything and everyone you knew is gone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good idea for rwritingprompts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where the shit do you get your pickles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wine is just fermented grape juice cheese is just molded milk sausage is just grounded up pig intestines encased in their own fat yet all of these things are still delicious you could tell me im being fed a literal pile of shit but if its prepared in a way that somehow tastes great and im already halfway done im not gonna suddenly stop and be like aw man this delicious meal is now ruined
Showerthoughts,not_removed,vinegar is acetic acid which is made by fermenting apple juice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apple cider vinegar is just one of many types of vinegar and i dont think it is commonly used for pickling white vinegar aka distilled vinegar is usually used for pickling and it typically originates as either malt or corn there are httpsenwikipediaorgwikivinegar different kinds of vinegar and most of them dont come from apples
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if spiderman bit a spider
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now i wanna see spiderman bite someone in the middle of a fight just pull up his mask a bit grab the motherfucker and bite him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but it would be cooler if he bit a spider which would become spidermanspider
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that seems like it causes more problems than it solvesalso theres already a solution two if you just count getting another justice appointed the lower court ruling gets upheld without setting precedent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a very spatial thought you must be extra spacial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure great idea so with a court evenly ish divided between conservative and liberal wings which side wants to volunteer to lose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all of us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i learned the lesson of reading the plot line first with pretty woman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre not getting old just lazy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you ever watched impractical jokers im sure that is not how it works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah oops is just as likely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre drunk mate go home
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mine is to stop procrastinating im going to start next week
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same but only if it was a comedy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the current technology i think is pretty sound i do think they should make the holding tank of clear plexiglass for the entertainment of those waiting in line another feature would be level lines of how full its getting it would help in deciding if you really want to use it or go piss behind a tree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what were you expecting them to become is not like theres much room for improvement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,firstworld problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chamber pots of the century
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a robot that pulls the shit out of your ass for you thats what op wants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it just seems strange that with all this new technology we still shit directly into other peoples shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like samwise gamgeesp he never left the shire until their journey
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same here i have a mile commute just to get to work so miles a day a week a month
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes me think of lions games the best option is to get drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stupidly none of the blind people are actually blind daredevil in the shit movie is depicted as visually seeing sounds the blind sensei type dude in the shit elektra movie seemed to have no visual deficit whatsoever its like blindness is debilitating so lets have a superhero overcome itwith magic yeah thats real inspirational
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant watch the show or see this post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true it is much like i dont mind black people as long as they dont look too black or talk too black or walk too black but yeah black people are okay as long as they remind me of white people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blind people can use the internet and read text
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but they cant see the post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is so fucking raw it still has the ability to give birth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a badgers den
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is way too pink
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no just no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a lot of women think hes sexy maybe men too i dunno
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even the old woman from home alone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must be a hoot at parties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes her name was marian seldes and she past away october
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i watch it die
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then the third who take a page from the doctors book and give it air from our lungs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and theres who dont have candles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can see that causing so so many problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could offer helpful hints on how they could improve
Showerthoughts,not_removed,incest is wincest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is for people in the ozarks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they will never run out of marvel and dc heroes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like people who say things like this havent taken a proper math science or any kind of art class
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah nah you cant memorize critical thinking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry youre going to a bad school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stay in buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they have tried testing our intelligence with classes like ap physics or ap calculus where you get a lot of questions requiring you to do some thinking take higher level classes if you want your intelligence and memory put to the test
Showerthoughts,not_removed,looks like you didnt remember any grammar lessons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this sub should test ops reposts httpswwwredditcomrshowerthoughtssearchqschooltestmemoryrestrictsronsortrelevancetall
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre thinking of tests
Showerthoughts,not_removed,intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills as per google most schools give you information you acquire it by studying it memorizing it and retain it longterm by applying it if you forget it its because you stopped applying it after you took your test edit in shorter terms in order to be intelligent youre going to have to retain information otherwise youll need constant supply of the same shit over and over again schools are helping you memorize things so that you can retain information faster and keep it longer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it also tests how hardworking you are which is a crucial skill in life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where is this fantasy world that hipsters and misanthropes live in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which i suppose is a good thing because intelligence is an innate quality not one which can be improved like memoryknowledge so if it tested your intelligence they might as well just kick out all the kids who flunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,intelligence is your ability to learn not the summation of learning ace a stats class and tell me that isnt a test of intelligence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in elementary and middle school you learn the basics of reading and writing mathematics science etc but after that it would seem that all you really do is memorize random facts learn the political views of your teachers and practice many of the same mechanics that you were already taught while there are obviously some exceptions to this math class and middle school english class the vast majority of all classes will have a teacher tell your random pieces of information and then then the teacher again tells tell tells you and later you take a test in a couple of weeks that accomplishes quite literally nothing the problem is mainly that this is not how we learn tell tell tell is ineffective it has been proven time and time again that learners thrive when they have clear objectives and are given real world scenarios to make decisions based on the information that they are learning and to gently increase the difficulty until the learner must learn something in order to accomplish new tasks with that information with our current system once the information is taken in nothing is done with it so our brains will eventually just throw it out to make place for more relevant information what this essentially means is that you are only having your short term memory tested and you are not actually proving that you could accomplish anything in the real world everything in modern times is driven by innovation and when schools have students follow strict guidelines and rules that restrict them to the point where each student is essentially doing the exact same project our modern world isnt really reflected that well innovation in grade schools is decades behind we are taught next to nothing about rights and the law local federal economics how to handle moneycredit critical thinking homecar maintenance first aid and ems techniques timeproject management also i learned more from khanacademyorg than from the entirety of high school and my undergraduate work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes i forget there are year olds on reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,timed tests and words per minute the numbers are all parents hear about at the school my kids attend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,school only succeeds in testing my patience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,school teaches you to pass exams nothing else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it teaches you how to follow orders conform
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only for bad schools
Showerthoughts,not_removed,school educates education intelligence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,big time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the public school system for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as an american this is so true all of the reading math history and most of the science at least in texas isnt about how well you can think through a problem it is about how much you remember from the past year because down here we teach for the test best education systems s
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this has been known
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even if this were totally true which its not as everyone else in this thread has pointed out good memory is heavily associated with intelligence so testing memory is testing intelligence even if it is only one aspect of it stop complained about your education and learn everything you can take your own initiative
Showerthoughts,not_removed,scandinavia has the best system dont ask me why it works but hours in school a day seems to work very well for them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im currently studying for a degree in theoretical physics and i feel that the british education system left me horribly unprepared
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think thats the point a lot of public schools dont teach well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or fluid intelligence or abstract thought or crystalline intelligence or associative hierarchy a good school would test much more than memory however ill admit some in certain parts of the world dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can memorise the marking system for critical thinking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont need critical thinking in american public school hell you barely need it in college
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you actually learned critical thinking skills in the public education system youre one of the rare lucky ones that or youre outside the us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yah tests and all that bull the system should care more about learning not test scores
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to get to those higher classes you first have to finish some easier classes which require you to regurgitate information onto paper once you get to those higher classes youve already been taught to just regurgitate now theyre putting intelligence to the test when all your life youve not even thought about intellwgendvw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it looks like you didnt remember any grammar lessons ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this man gets it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good grades dont make you smart but being quickthinking which is not quite the same thing as intelligent does make it easier to get good grades having a good memory also helps a lot which is more important depends on the subject and the style of education
Showerthoughts,not_removed,amen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dunno how long its been since youve been in high school but now its all critical thinking and minimal memorization at least in my experience from several years ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go to china vietnam russia anywhere arabic then come back to the us and tell me how the us has no emphasis on critical thinking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,grades are the only incentives for learning for a lot of people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn straight as a gifted child who struggled in state school i was told it would get easier as i got older and went to university that you just have to get the learningbyrote stuff out of the way before you actually get to learn anything i still ended up skipping class to go read in the library learning is fun it seems perverse to lock kids up in classrooms and make them write when they could be learning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it looks as though you did not remember apa format ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im in no way a bush supporter but the decline in education has been happening for decades now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,finland is probably what they were referring to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok finland then maybe denmark
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what does their education system look like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont doubt that there are other horrible public schools systems out there i was simply expressing that i am an american many users on this website are not i think you missed my point completely i havent met very many people from the american public school system who were taught critical thinking ive known many who have learned this skill set from private schools and higher learning universities or even on their own as mature adults the truth is you get what you pay for and the schools in the public sector are horribly mismanaged financially while private schools have much better hiring tactics they can fire teachers who either shouldnt be teachers to begin with or or are just lazy and their graduation percentages are tremendously higher than public schools the numbers are there to back up what i am saying i really just have better things to do with my time than look up stats for an argument on the internet about something like public education dont believe me look it up for yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay how about none of them do including the us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are correct there p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree completely colleges and high schools should focus primarily on teaching skills through application and simulated situations information is easier to digest based on interest and pace schools also need to focus less on maintaining our grade point averages and use a system to identify mastery khan academy has a great system for this and also duo lingo one taught me calculus and the other spanish german and french they identify our skill level and generates a learning path to reach our desires goal this system also requires occasional reviews to ensure the information is retained and exercised learning needs to be treated like health it requires training practice habit and determination and it is never just naturally given you have to keep feeding and working out the brain i just thought i should point out the higher level courses have the aspect of challenging questions and information retention
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the solution has been around way longer going back to dewey
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre lucky if you can afford continued schooling in vietnam lol and the regime isnt exactly friendly to critical thinking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i teach at an international school in the us and the students from these countries grow very anxious when asked for a creative assignment or one that shows critical understanding they want to know what the proper phrase term or equation to memorize is many are so poorly versed they resort to mass plagiarism because they have no idea what to do they often remark that it is a key difference between their education here us and at home that here they are called upon to understand things in much more depth than in their home countries
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in china the kids take a test after the fourth grade half of them fail and are sent to work on farms its easy to make your high school kids look good on tests when youve eliminated the worst half imagine how many latebloomers are condemned to a life of drudgery and might have contributed in later life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,respectfully i dont believe you even with tales of your personal anecdotal sampling from a highly biased dataset people you know public school teachers are paid more public school teachers have teacher certification and private school teachers need literally nothing i am a private school teacher who went to a great inner city public school and proceeded to get his phd in physics my classmates again a biased sample similarly got a great critical thinking education even presenting the numbers and assuming they agree with you youve got the giant elephant in the confounding factor room of socioeconomic status in urban school systems that are known to be shitty middle class educationally minded parents either dont move to that citys district or just send their kids to private school as for the notion that i missed your point your comment made no remarks about publicprivate distinction it just made a unsupported blanket statement about the quality of httpsenwikipediaorgwikischooldistrict school districts that span so let me address your point directly for all the popular image of american education being about memorization staying in line listening to your teachers and obedience those criticisms only exist because we live in such an open society that has so much httpsenwikipediaorgwikivalueethicsmediafileinglehartvaluesmapsvg we make that criticism because the standards are so high in reality we are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,decades of republicans cutting taxes as if it had no consequences
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes me wonder how many of these other countries that are so much smarter than the us fudge their testing numbers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is a nine year compulsory education period in china its still savagely competitive as a late bloomer i would be screwed there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact astronauts are not allowed to have sex in outerspace i am not sure if this rule applies to masturbation but i imagine that masturbation would be banned for the same reasons that sex are its also not crazy to think that a spaceman has had a wet dream in space
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably not to many due to the effects of zero gravity on the astronautsits an environment not conducive to sexy time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,harder to clean upgiggity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a hard time going a day without if its not a thing i wouldnt want to sign up thats a deal breaker for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have

Showerthoughts,not_removed,plant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my friend eve disagrees profusely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so basically its the avatar of animated films
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay but it didnt have the mass appeal of walle everyone from kids to senior citizens liked walle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ha ha youre funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what did she say maybe we can quote her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,avatar is liked i dont know a single person who loves it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my entire soul rebels against this comparison
Showerthoughts,not_removed,she didnt say anything everyone around her said her name in the walle voice for about years after it came out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,avatar is like a plain vanilla cupcake with amazing icing design you ooh and aahh because its so pretty but theres nothing unique about the flavor and other bakers have done it better before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all grams of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all grams of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the once thats over we just cant wait for the sweet release of death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats called milestones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eh is a bit of a nothing in aus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meh thats when real responsibility hits and you starts realizing you cant wait to be so your car insurance premiums go down a little really its just want giant downhill trip to your grave after
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then you look forward to then when you got you wish you were
Showerthoughts,not_removed,once you hit the next milestone is so enjoy it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bcuz ur gay and gay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people tend nowadays to eat blander cheeses in north america but there are yummy cheeses with a very strong door
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do it next time and suffer an eternity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i did it by accident and i ended up reading the labels on the back of the shampoo it took me back to my youth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take a book with you instead or go all oldschool and get a newspapart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sung to the tune of oops i did it again what the ac tu al fuuuuuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,neither is life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not sure if youre familliar with showerthoughts the subbreddit but one of the rules clearly states no jokes do you also go to a movie theater just to scream dont record the film on a camera or tell a friend dont fist my anus i doubt it so dont do it here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and that my friend is how people get put on cringe compilations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,son how high are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they were all men all of them they lived in peace for generations developing a rich and complex language then one day someone with great big boobies arrived and they were like woah man and thus she was named
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wasnt there a story last year where someone actually made a printed vehicle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no well just refer to as hindsight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or this could be the pinnacle moment where they are differentiatedand a neologism is determinedi vote for hindsight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have a crystal ball
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh man i hope i live that long years old
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was born in i want to die before im old but at the same time i want to live to just to have lived through three centuries
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a lot of the people reading this will not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one day you wont wake up that could be well before it could be tomorrow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is years from now meth will end you long before that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its actually more or less the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a rich american tradition
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you and i having wildly different experiences
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this would get a better response if it were the number of people that like titties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i posted a few showerthoughts that were more thoughtful than this but looks like they were autodeleted this one isnt even a real statement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this doesnt work on the phone app
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it isnt you pretentious twat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre literally times better at math when youre posting drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im times times more likable when im drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats like how some people say something like till for a time of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the phrase was invented before the number six
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who says half of a dozen ive always heard it half a dozen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,six of one and half a dozen of the other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,half of a bakers dozen minus one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think ive ever said or heard half of a dozen just half a dozen or half dozen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still got the same amount of syllables so its not really taking longer either way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but it survived in a century when people say k instead of okay pretty impressive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still longer than six
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still longer than six
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dafuq did you just type
Showerthoughts,not_removed,time greeting farewell morning good morning good day afternoon good afternoon good day evening good evening good night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you add have a before any of them they are all common ways of saying good bye
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats cuz ur dying youre just starting to feel et now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and a great grandchild and a great great grandchild and a great great great grandchild
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i give up who
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sad post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats some bodies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe the reason for that was that their shop teacher said something like if this car was any better it could fly so the logical step was to make that second line the ending of the movie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is it just me or does that movie have a remarkable contempt for all of its characters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt there a theory its all a dream or vision from a wreckage of a car crash victim i forget which theres an article or two out there joining the dots if interested
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the theory is that in the song when danny sings i saved her life she nearly drowned its an implication that sandy did actually drown and then dreamed up the story of her staying and getting together with her dream man as she was dying or died
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not just you it happens to me and i usually end up opening the ad they probably do it on purpose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes same so annoying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same i think weve stumbled on to a conspiracy here guys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like u just watched inception lolummm i think bc u are able to remember things when u are awake bc when u are dreaming and u wake up u dont remember of what transpired
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but i think you can tell when you are dreaming sometimes also it is clear that one is a reflextion of the other so which is the original version
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol never seen inception
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude best movie ever watch it right now it will prolly confuse u wayyy more tho lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,degree nights and degree days would be first world problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont worry well all be firstworld countries once the sun eats the first two
Showerthoughts,not_removed,repost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,any better id be dangerous adds a bit of variety
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my buddy always says average and its great to witness the reactions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always say not to bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im alright or not bad are usually my automated responses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id usually answer with all righty or meh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah ive had people say theyve had better days im always like aw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its obvious that they are just lies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its pretty funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell that to the chicago river
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which means that hydro power is really gravity power
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never thought about how one might taste until now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is such a thing as dry cleaning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chinchillas take dust baths
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chemical bath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dry washing is a gold mining technique
Showerthoughts,not_removed,something can be awash with light
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which in reality is anything but dry using liquid solvents instead of water should be called solvent cleaning not dry cleaning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be literal though we are talking water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there will be a time in your life when your parents set you down and never pick you up again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with most sites the porn is the advertisement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if they could they would thing is i dont think advertisment in porn is that big sure you have penis enlargements other porn and some quick schemes but the companies who can pay for a proper videoad usually dont want to get associated with porn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mind blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only time ive clicked on a link on a porn site is by accident in mid jack off while trying to quickly find that right video
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then why do a i always get facebook sign up popups then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ha blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill be watching ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
Showerthoughts,not_removed,showerthoughts more like bedthoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im in tomorrow where are you is that you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good bye
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im ready for op for when op falls asleep ಠಠ ω
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not even wearing a hat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and it is again far out this is my first recycled reddit post way cool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes its me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im up good morning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then how can i tip the fedora
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no theres nothing good about this morning i had to piss in my cheerios because i was out of milk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tip your own fedora gosh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its better if its chilled
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oy are ye off yer trolley ye shouldnt ask a lad to tip his own edora cheeky eh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there exists a point where you could be considered too impaired to post anything worthile or logical you passed it going on a
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill do my part
Showerthoughts,not_removed,farts smell so deaf people can enjoy them too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,username checks out guys probably high as fuck from huffing shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apparently in the walking dead universe zombies never existed so no classic horror movies thus they created their own word for it i saw that in a preseason show were they talked about the show lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,different earth different slang
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lucky them unfortunately they missed out on the zombie strippers movie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are a lot of movies were they dont say zombie even is shaun of the dead he tells ed not to call them that the original night of the living dont use the word either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just interesting how each group in the show refers to them differently yet not a single one says zombie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea because they never knew such a thing existed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah every aspect of hollywood action movies are usually very realistic especially in gun fights chase scenes physical altercations and human interactions but fuck me when those airbags dont go off i be like what the fuck this shit be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no because they still want to capitalise on older people wanting the software they used for a while
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only if that person was donald trump
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would probably be class driven the vast majority of the wealthy would still be alivewealthy protected by the promise of money how would we know its over and the killing has stopped most people would walk away with ptsd of some variety everyday life would be a war zone what would stop people from killing just one person bet you cant kill just one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,couldnt that mean only one person could be left
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes omnicide is the only answer there should not be anyone alive ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,easy when all life is extinguished there would be no problems what is so good about life that makes living it worthwhile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for a little while
Showerthoughts,not_removed,forever not just a little while forever omnicide fixes all problems forever too bad your only advice is go be homeless bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a nice thought but doesnt work in practice for large companies for one thing it doesnt allow for meritbased raises it also reduces flexibility for a company to change budgets from year to year to invest in itself or expand outward
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the percentage of the salaries could be up to of all the revenues the remaining is to be invested saved or to give a premium to excellent workers but remember that i have no idea what im talking about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but again those arent large companies the largest majorityemployeeowned company is publix super markets with employees which is pretty big but the second largest company only has employees and the sizes drop off pretty quickly after that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,here you go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol that shit is a scam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there probably is one in german
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a vast majority of the oil we use now is actually from plant matter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mostly single celled organisms like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpwwwucmpberkeleyeducarboniferouscarboniferousphp
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and micro organisms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know a few that lean to the left but you are correct most are on the right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,starting to look that way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the rest of the time they are running for office
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most assholes think theyre stating facts but theyre usually misleading irrelevant or wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice try mr trump
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most of the facts are stating who assholes are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you forgot a period
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does that make you an asshole for stating that fact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take my upvote you asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the facts point out the assholes that cannot accept them hence sometimes the fact providers sometimes resort to lowering themselves to make sure the facts are understood
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most of the time theyre using stating facts as an excuse to be assholes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please include proof
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most of the time assholes are the people who dont sugarcoat things to others i have seen that they often tell other the truths that people do not want to hear people do not typically ask a question intending to get the answer they ask a question wanting to hear themselves validated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,benghazi never forget
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its true you can trust squanche because hes an asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see what this guy said is true cause hes not an asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,better yet they should just start accepting prepaid visa cards hehe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blockbuster used to do that i miss blockbuster fridays
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do stop at like or so dont they
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty reasonable imo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seems reasonable but i somehow racked up in charges for one game i had kept forgetting to return iirc it was a game about a detective thats dead solving his own murder or something needless to say it didnt retail anywhere near edit games called murdered soul suspect not even close to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait why and why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was a kid barriers didnt exist back then and trains were expensive for a kid because i dont want to have to queue up and get one at the station
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know what barriers are lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know what barriers are lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the uk tend to have ticket barriers at most stations now basically you insert your train ticket into the barrier and it opens stops people stealing free rides and youd think that being british wed love to queue for things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,until someone forgets their phone and they read it out of boredom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i dont think my phone battery is going to last so if theres anything suspicious on my shampoo bottles ill let you guys know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except when we go poo and dont have our phones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah someone should keep those shampoo companies in check
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when did that happen to you last
Showerthoughts,not_removed,using the same phone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all too often
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then you need a power outlet near the can
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doesnt help when i dont have the phone with me at all 🤔
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we need to call xzibit to come have a look at your bathroom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont own a microwave but cant you just set it to a longer time than needed and cancel it manually when its done
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about the ding or beep or whatever sound your micro wave makes i know that of my micro wave went off in the middle of the night itd wake me straight up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,deodorizer and even thats not a word
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or you could politely tell your wife not to be a judgemental judy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mine has a mute button
Showerthoughts,not_removed,use the oven
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that requires focus at in the morning oven smells to much also i tried
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its my wife
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ughh you know some old art called cooking it helps me a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,family guy hahahahahahahaha d in comedy views since apr ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the textual version
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you mr bot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sexual textual
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why i sleep on the floor statistically speaking a lot of people die in their beds and dont even get me started on hospitals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and as you havent yet died im presuming id say youve been proved right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry dude but i have to disagree one pie is not enough for me then how can be infine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of pi is it is not infinite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of pi is an irrational number likely with an infinite sequence of digits but is itself finite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they would and then buy the cereal as an adapter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,without jacks the gameplay is so much more efficient its faster than your regular set of cards not to mention how beautiful they are lets see what jony has to say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would they also buy deck without queens and kings because its more democratic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the trick is to put your iphone in a bowl and add milk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,audible fear the lighting is what gets ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is but thats not why thunder scares people it just surprises you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats when the home intruders break down the glass in the movies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go home youre drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some people get physically uneasy for the whole duration of a thunderstorm though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have been way too close to lightning too many times less than feet away from a strike at least times the last nearmiss dropped a tree on our house ive a pavlovian response to thunder now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt that spinal fluid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes tldr y
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no tldr no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is a tldr
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too long didnt read
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know what you shouldnt do post in shower thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know what you shouldnt do comment on posts in shower thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most of the time the growth of the surrounding area outpaces the added capacity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its never done
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bingo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most of the time your search will appear otherwise you close it because you become impatient
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i was studying this in math the teacher would ask the difference at the beginning of every test he said he kept asking because students kept getting it wrong they kept thinking they could use the everyday meanings of words in math you cant dont get me started about how everybody is hung up on real and imaginary numbers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow pop over to rpersonalfinance thats a consortium no one should end up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this week i over drew my account by cents and i didnt have any cash so i literally had to find pennies in the floorboard of my car and take them to the teller in my bank so i wouldnt get charged the or whatever they charge you my teller kept a straight face but all the others were laughing their asses off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,here you go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,poor people are the easiest to rip off they have fewer options and cannot afford to sue businesses targeting the poor charge more for less see coin laundries mobile home parks convenience stores and pay day loans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then the bank gives that money to somebody who already has a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go to a different fi try a credit union
Showerthoughts,not_removed,repost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah im sure someone out of the subscribers has thought of this before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only one famous one though louis ck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,south park all the time family guy when im high
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are so many different theories on how appocalypse will come and in almost all of them youre wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people who do this are a bit vague on exactly what is going to happen the supplies might be useful and they might not it doesnt really matter since the actual point is to make their lives seem more exciting than they are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,darn i was trying to edit to add something on mobile and deleted it sorry c
Showerthoughts,not_removed,elaborate please educate the ignorant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree it definitely becomes a pastime or hobby
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the world ending doesnt mean that the earth just vanishes it just means the breakdown of society and our constructs which results in or is the result of an apocalyptic event like nuclear war or an asteroid that doesnt mean your food supplies are going to evaporate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in any scenario where chaos reigns as a result nukes zombies massive emp megavolcano megaquake megameteor etc hunkering down is your best bet and given the sheer size of the world the odds are in your favor that the epicenter of whatever event does happen wont be close enough to directlyimmediately affect you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i assumed the end of the world meant it was essentially uninhabitable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true i was more thinking of a scenario in which the world was uninhabitable in its entirety thats what i interpret as being the end of the world i interpret other events in which human life is still possible albeit requires a battle for survival as a disaster event
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would be the end of the earth i guess subtle but distinct difference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes thats true i didnt think of it that way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just you i believe lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,almost like ice cubes in your ice cream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe the best thing to come out of mars colonization will be that we finally replace toilet paper with something better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mars will probably use bidets and reclaimed water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when youre sitting on the jon and your toilet papers gone be a man and use your hand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what did watney use
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe they can use bamboo its fast growing but im not sure if it can be used for paper i think there was some bamboo growing in the ksr books
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mars will have to import pretty much all its goods for some time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wiping with soil doesnt sound bad though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mars dust is good for absorbing shit fact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,especially if cartman gets there first
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what like three sea shells
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what could be better three shells
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im guessing itll be sea shells
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not reallyfood can be grown tools can be printed etc but paper takes a loooong time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,am i missing some joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its from the movie demolition man stallone never did find out how to use the three sea shells
Showerthoughts,not_removed,breeeeenh you have been fined one credit for a violation of the spoiler morality statute
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it feels amazing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably just hot or enjoy being naked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would like to subscribe to your newsletter what youre saying makes perfect sense to me ♡
Showerthoughts,not_removed,venn diagram and no there are lots of people lost their virginity to a prostitute but arent league players
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my newsletter mostly includes rants about donald trump being a time traveler hating my favorite football teams kanye west never being wrong even when hes fucking wrong how amazing my kids are and which of my three cats is pissing me off at any given moment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im drunk and in a mean funny mood so my bad on the misspelling you would appear to be correct but considering how many lol named that for a reason players there are these days and how socially stunted they all are the percentages somehow equal out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well you came into a joke thread being serious and kept with it i can only assume if you hadnt lost your virginity on the farm itd have been to a prostitute between rounds of that shitty game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that debate with yourself self in the morning wheter to have a shower or an extra mins in bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lolz
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or choosing to buy a car that has more affordable parts unless circumstances only allowed for that car ie handmedown or similar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you cant afford to maintain it you cant afford to buy it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we internet veterans know that adblock has a shady bussiness with a lot of ad companies so now it has a white list of ads to show and now you have pop ups appear or some fucked up ads showing up so we internet veterans use other adblock software i use adblocker but we know which sites we like and want to see it growing and which dont so we whitelist pages whenever we want
Showerthoughts,not_removed,explain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ad a long time content creator and developer on the net for nearly years i know that it is a necessity to run an adblocker all this whining about creators not getting ad revenue is just pure nonsense the number cause of mediocrity and flaccid wasteful bullshit content on the internet are ad revenue models and the greedy bastards that think the world owes them something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well new people just plain out havent heard of it yet someone who knows their way around the internet know of it and think its a useful tool those who are either a a free content creator or b know the story of a free content creator know that adblock is a big reason why stuff on the internet is shifting to paid services instead since thats the only way they can make money now adblock makes it so you dont support those who make free content who need ads to make a living
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean how do i even come back to that like shit dude there goes my whole argument im honestly curious what do you make im not trying to make an argument for myself i just wanna know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt use an adblocker until websites started using shit popups that stopped the site from working in the first place played loud ad videos randomly and spread viruses through unsecure ads sites that offer me good content without putting shit like that on their site get whitelisted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i make interactive and video content for historicalcultural entities like musea schoolsuniversities or municipalities for example short documentaries about historical events or online databases for archaeological sites i am very much against internet ad revenue schemes because these devalue the content it comes with and snows under the content that is put out there for its own sake the internet is not getting more valuable and useful if tens of thousands of people all do the same copycat trick like game channels or top lists expecting to get payed for it it is just getting more cluttered
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always wondered why didnt he just go around candlesticks generally ard not very wide
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a explain b youre on the internet why did you censor it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can swear on the internet kid your mum isnt going to read it shes too busy being fucked by me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe for example when his mom finds out he cussed on the interwebs hell be fked but still be a virgin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called lifelol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,each member of the police force carries the backing of the entire organization behind them one officer is a part of the whole therefore when they say this is the police it figuratively is the whole police force knocking at your door its like when you call the elevator youre the one that pressed the button not the tiny part of your finger that actually made contact with the button the police officer making that call is the part that touches the button and the rest of your body is the police force
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless its the band
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is a synecdoche a figure of speech using the part for the whole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well its totally accurate when i hear it for those who dont get it its by the police originally
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck some police comin straight from the underground
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it might be the police if its a small department but in other cases some logically valid alternatives would be we are police or just police
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well no because one guy isnt a police one officer is one police officer we are some police officers would be correct
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont stand so close to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have finally noticed me senpai now die pulls out katana cuts in half at the waist ok wow im sorry that got like really dark there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the police the who no the police
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for introducing me to synecdoche it sounds dirty but isnt the best type of words
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was a reference to yandere simulator
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nobody knows what the fuck that is take your anime bullshit to the otaku subreddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ranimehate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,umad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im fuming just sitting here thinking about user on reddit whos probably years old im so fucking pissed holy shit whats ur adress
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so yeah umad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go put on your naruto headband and go to school kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont like naruto actually i do not own a single piece of anime merchandise you dont even know what yandere simulator is do you it just sounds japanese so you are triggered by it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you repost something id bet youd get even more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats an idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most other mammals can also walk run communicate relatively well feed them selves and even procreate within a year after birth humans require years to reach a self sufficient level that lesser mammal requires plus humans dont even get their own ipads until age
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the millenials have never left the womb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heck i still dont have an ipad i must be developmentally challenged
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wasnt going to say anything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like bill gates
Showerthoughts,not_removed,caring comes to mind they might come from money and probably have more debt than you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the more money you have the more debt you can accrue if youre low income and have no equity credit is hard to come by most people in the us buy big ticket items with credit eg you dont own your car until the loan is paid in full a lot of people lease and never actually own the car this is why theres a liens section on titles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they also had to pass on a lot of coming of age and enjoying themselves as and for themselves to be a parent assuming they stepped up and took responsibility
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id rather be a virgin than be a kid with a kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it takes like times of sex on average before you conceive a baby so could be worth it depending on how you look at it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup i would think no one would argue that lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they already have that its called the afb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and coincidentally exactly who i would want rescuing me in a hostage situation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont understand why people refer to chromecast as a service it doesnt offer any content its essentially just a magic invisible hdmi cable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well it helps do everything cable can without a monthly sub and commercials
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chromecast isnt giving you tv shows and movies netflix and hulu and all those other sites are providing the content chromecast just helps you view it on a tv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok but without cc i cant see any of those its like half the service
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no without chromecast you can still watch netflix and hulu and every other piece of content on your phonetabletlaptop chromecast is just one device of many that lets you view your device on your tv but it is not a content service
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i use it for tvs and its what i need its very useful to me its literally what enables me to use those services on my tv its why i can cut the cable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree its very useful its just odd that people are more likely to say i watch chromecast than i watch roku even though both products essentially do the same thing in terms of making content available google did a great job marketing it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your still giving them profit rather then none at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is renting and beating a game stealing from developers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just tune it out unsubscribe from angry political subs and skim past the posts that may anger you you will be so much happier i used to be like this until i realized how angry and negative i was and decided to change my ways
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i told you that you needed to chill but you thought i said you needed to kill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i found facebook to be way more infuriating than reddit past tense because i logged out a month ago i dont miss it one bit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this sucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why so serious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre the problem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is good advice but its not always bad it helped me get more informed on the epipen issue my problem was that id spend an hour reading through comments and other related posts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whose bringing the netflix
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same here reddit is just random strangers facebook makes me realize what poor choices ive made in friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i deactivated mine as well never going back at least here we dont know each other so im not embarrassed when i see racist stuff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alcohol is a solution
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to do the same thing and i would get into arguments in the comments and stuff but it just wasnt worth getting so angry about especially over things that i cant control which is of the news i still hear about things like the epi pen issue only in a more passive way now and i dont get upset getting upset isnt going to change it it just ruins my own time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but just because its a comment or a post on reddit doesnt mean its informative in fact ive noticed its more likely to be complete bullshit or a biased article save a few subs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gigiddy giggidy giggidy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a problem too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which subs do you find to be best for accurate information
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if its your only solution then yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rscience and raskscience are generally pretty good as with anywhere on the internet you just have to make sure that the guy making the point and backing up his point with an article is unbiased and factual which is hard to do sometimes in general i think reddit likes to think they know more than they do about politics and economics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fackin a
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes they do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nobody stops to thank the janitor the chef the garbage man the teacher or the security guard policeman arent entitled to more of a thank you than a lot of other jobs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a civil service a goverment of the people by the people and for the people mostly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i try to do that as often as i can same with any person who provides service i benefit from second hand never forget that you stand on the shoulders of hundreds of people who make sure your life can even exist and thank those people when you can
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre correct theyre not entitled to that however they are risking their lives to protect and serve so theres that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the risk of heart disease is real from all of those donuts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats whoa ya i guess that could happen i need to travel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no pain isnt a factor in breathing you need oxygen or you wont stay conscious you wont feel pain to indicate this you would just not be able to breathe properly and may struggle before passing out but wont feel any pain other than psychological
Showerthoughts,not_removed,breathing is involuntary so you cant forget anecdotally ive heard of a toddler that chewed through his tongue and bled out while his parents werent watching
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i came to this question by competing in breath holding competition with my friend i felt that if it werent for that awkward feeling when your ran out of breath i would probably just black out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see the thing is that even if you did black out youd immediately start breathing again because its an involuntary reflex controlled by your brain stem in fact breathing in is relaxing your muscles so even if the reflex doesnt work youll et at least one breath however if you didnt feel pain you could easily die from bleeding out without noticing or from burning your hand or some other part of yourself and just cooking yourself to death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do blind people get motion sickness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,four no seven times maybe twelve hudred and three
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the worst pain brother
Showerthoughts,not_removed,indeed brother
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mine would not spelling out boobs with a calculator is basic humor some of the shit ive done on the internet is insanely embarrassing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sticky keys is the reason why i cant comfortably hump people in minecraft
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know why your keys are sticky lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the real question is would you rather have half a rolls royce or a full smartcar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can win half a car on wheel of fortune
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive seen an episode where the full car was the smart car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wheels of fortune
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i prefer buttmunch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha totally you cant even pretend its anything but hey what if i put my dick here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you turned it around at the end there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah awesome showerthought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are you talking about theyve been selling them since the i used to get them sometimes you didnt miss much theyre just vanilla wafers stoners can make eating anything look better than it really is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not talking about bullshit massmarketed snacks im talking about the canon dog treat that was so deliciously savory that even shaggy couldnt get enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a child would you have known the difference besides it was a thinly veiled stoner joke just like half the gags involving shaggy they went over kids heads but it was really just making fun of the increased appetite of mj users and their tendency to sometimes eat odd things as a result this is also why shaggy and scooby ended up in the kitchen making absurdly huge sandwiches with ridiculous ingredients in almost every episode at some point its also why they rode in the back of the van while everyone else sat up front and why smoke was sometimes coming off the back end of the van from the doors rather than the tailpipe youll notice no one else was eating them they were dog biscuits if you really want to know buy a bag of milk bones and eat one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes im aware that it is a stoner joke as a kid i was not aware and yes as a kid i was aware of the difference between a vanilla and cardboard tasting piece of crap and a savory dog treat so delicious that even humans wanted to eat it i imagined it was something like a slim jim but in biscuit form
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always just assumed that shaggy was a weird dude i noticed right away that no one else was interested in these amazing treats they were eating ive always had a dog and they looked enough like dog treats that i just assumed that shaggy liked dog treats for some strange reason i didnt find out why until i was older of course everyone who has a dog at a young enough age tries it at some point with or without scooby doo as i recall they just tasted kind of like a really thick and crunchy unsalted cracker not bad but nothing noteworthy i figured he just liked dog biscuits and while a little odd it wasnt that weird considering some of the other foods adults ate they ate brussel sprouts and spinach voluntarily so a dude liking dog biscuits wasnt a huge stretch for a kid to make hell after trying them it was easier to understand someone liking them than some other foods grown ups ate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all part of the masterplan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a strangely beautiful thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,basically bling is the name of my new rap album
Showerthoughts,not_removed,edge is actually decent tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or when an old utility program opens links in ie automatically
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the new generation of kids will never know what having an ugly picture printed is ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they shouldnt be a luxury item when taxed they should be under same tax as groceries
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the protest was taxing them as a luxury item iirc there were arguments against taxing them in general but people also make that argument about food and water i think your analogy is misplaced
Showerthoughts,not_removed,food should be free the system we have now is broken anyhow we need something better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they both attract bears
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apples grow on trees pads do not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,triggered because vagina
Showerthoughts,not_removed,farmers make money off of growing that food if its free why are farmers working they may as well keep it for themselves and let ingrates like you starve if you want free food then grow your own
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pads are made from paper pulp though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we should all just free bleed until that shit becomes free or at least super cheap one week of all women doing that and people will be begging for their tax dollars to cover menstrual products ideally we would all use reusable pads or cups but that isnt realistic disposable products are a privilege but so is the ability to wash clothes in your own home everyday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my point was people should contribute to society what they can but those who dont have much to contribute or are unable for a period of time are still entitled to food and shelter as humans we should take care of each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also sponges are naturally occurring creatures
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what i mean is anybody could pick fruit from a tree or kill a rabbit and cook it over fire i wouldnt guess too many people could easily make quality pads on the cheap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was a tampon joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if all the sick got good healthcare and if all the poor and hungry were fed then the earths population would explode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i did get that i almost left a comment that was just a sound effect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at least somebody got it lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a ploy cows with guns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes they manipulate us right into the slaughterho oh wait
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but their children prosper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,always
Showerthoughts,not_removed,forever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,working out is more or less the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all of life is putting things into boxes and taking things out of boxes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,without the thinky bits i couldnt call my self alive though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,enters fetal position
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so less thinky and more picking up with my pinky ill just have another drinky or maybe ive had enough and ill pour it down the sinky
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lifes just growing bigger and then slowly falling apart all the while picking up and putting things down
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if you push buttons all the time you cant pick up a button
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thinky bits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,after that other people pick you up and drop you down a hole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well sometimes you just have to put down a reverse life to move forward at a degree angle in a downward spiral then take a left turn at highway and then up up down down left right a b start
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i take everything out of life minus one thing life is just that one thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuckkkkkkkkkkkk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont pick anything up or put anything into boxes at work nor do i pick up or put anything down so this seems incorrect to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then we get kinky
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lifes just one big game of agario
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what she said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,box is also slightly older slang for vagina
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hope thats tomorrow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i also think well look back on botox and anti aging facial surgery like we look back on shoulder pads the difference being that some people are stuck with the effects
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no human consciousness is not comparable to a single program all living things on the other hand are comparable to robots most illnesses are comparable to viruses and some are even literally caused by viruses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if human consciousness is similar to a computer program its not source im a programmer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so am i and you didnt make any point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my point is you are starting from a false assumption a human consciousness is not similar to a computer program at best a computer program can poorly mimic parts of consciousness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a big fan of using semicolons they link thoughts without creating runon sentences
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i use semicolons all the time i think theyre great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont like colons either thats why i hold down your mom and dad and alt at the same time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you werent born with a colon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am a big fan of the semicolon its a useful combination of a period and comma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is some trippy shit especially when you are tripping
Showerthoughts,not_removed,renters insurance same difference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then what does that make the desert areas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bald spots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,slavery is back aw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they actually dont care all that much mother animals dont expect to care for their puppies forever just like humans dont expect to care for their children until they die
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always wondered this myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive worked in dog grooming where ive seen rescues come in who used to be in a puppy mill i believe them to think nothing all emotion seems to be lost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont have to have a spoken language to feel emotions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well when we say the were generally not referring to the or the or the were referring to the most recent one in the future itll probably be the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure well all be dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mind blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is referred as the roaring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well we can just call the the roaring twenties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats gonna be fuckin weird tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if the end up being anything like the then yeah i hope so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why whats weird about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i think of the i think of drunk people at gatsbys parties i dont think i could ever call anything modern the it would feel strange
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well well have to see what happens in the maybe people will have lots of fancy gatsbystyle parties again just to keep it simple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably because the havent happened yet you have no new references
Showerthoughts,not_removed,man i hope so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that and have a working knowledge of the law
Showerthoughts,not_removed,peddlers of lies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,snaps fingers yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at one point you were also inside of your grand ma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you ever seen a comment that just set up a joke so perfectly so obviouslythat you felt there just wasnt any sport in making it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,question of moralitywhats more cruel subjecting pig to generations of torturehaving chunks cut out of it for bacon or continue killing billions of pigs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is infinitely cruel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so youd keep an animal for the sole purpose of cutting big chunks of flesh out of it on a regular basis thats cruel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt that a way to fight world hunger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its infinitely delicious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you truly want to embarrass your kids ducky momo is your friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no because it is now dirt and dirt is not clean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,soap can be made of more natural elements but not to the point of reversing its deserved function
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because you know you can never afford a photographer and software to make a quarterpounder made while the person is half paralysed into a brioche style bun hour smoked pulled pork with coleslaw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they most likely were its quite unlikely as there are a lot of molecules in a dinosaur but even more people to go around but still very possible source
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i got a kitten recently but i havent found the right picture to post to rawww when picking her up i thought im holding reddit gold right here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,better find it while shes still an adorable little kitten xd get the perfect cute pic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dog went into gear for the first time today and it took me by surprise so i cut a few holes in my boxers to rig her up some pants and i took pictures she looks like a dork waiting for my chance to accrue some of that sweet sweet gold
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always feel really bad if i just pirated it too ill watch it again to count as a view and feel like maybe that helps out the filmmakers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they should give warnings on all dvds coming soon to a netflix account near you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think they imply extraterrestrial intelligence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dolphins are assholes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rblindpeoplewiping
Showerthoughts,not_removed,inject them with nitro as steroids and they will get road rage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think it somewhat related to every culture having a recreational drug humans by design are very strange species
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you just answered your own question
Showerthoughts,not_removed,riamverybadass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,said httpsenwikipediaorgwikitimothytreadwell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you eat disasters ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know a stoner mom who has kids who arent triplets and she calls them the little turds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,homework youre still at home
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please provide an objective quantitative standard that is equitable purely objective and has no room for abuse who becomes the ultimate arbiter of fitness do you really want politicians and bureaucrats to have control of the most basic human instinct my father and his siblings grew up in poverty they all grew up to be moderately to very successful my cousins and i are doing quite well any definition of fitness will be inherently subjective despite your protestations and prone to abuse and will lead to forced birth control forced adoption and forced abortion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in theory this makes total sense in practice it just doesnt work are you going to license heterosexual couples to have sex are you going to force those who arent registered to get abortions when pregnancy happens it just doesnt work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like we all get what youre saying but like what everyone else has said it just cant be put into practice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it just seems crazy to me that a couple can have a child when they have no economic means of even providing for themselves or what about proving basic mental stability we allow drug addicts or the mentally unstable who arent even in control of their own lives to have children ultimately children born into situations like that are neglectedabusedexploited it just seems preventable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt even have to get into subjective qualifications what about showing basic economic capacity to provide for the child show that you at least have the meansincome for providing stable housing food it can start with the very basic quantitative things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and what will you do if they dont have that take the child away send it into one of the overfilled orphanages that are sometimes worse than living in a poor family
Showerthoughts,not_removed,againare you going to forcibly abort those who get pregnant anyway are you going to sterilize those who dont qualify unconstitutional
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats far from true if you are years old you have lived about million seconds even if you wrote the word the every second since the day you were born you would still have made less than a billion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the the the the the the the the the the the copy paste copy paste now repeat a billion times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if it averaged out to one the per second with no breaks to eat sleep etc itd take years to reach a billion dollars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would anyone pay you to do that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good thing no one is paying you for your estimating ability
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id be a thousandaire thousandaire patent pending
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha ive been doing just that and im
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ignorance isnt bliss when you cant understand why other people arent the same ignorant as you ydig
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess in certain cases the real bliss comes from ignorance of others ignorance

Showerthoughts,not_removed,well is still so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go outside
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i actually doubt that intelligence has always been a prime survival trait in our species and is becoming more valuable with each generation sure the rise in population allows for more stupid people to mate with other stupid people producing stupid babies but they are less likely to be longterm successful on a genetic level sooner or later the descendants will get dumb enough that theyll die off before they pass on their genes if anything we should be getting smarter on average over time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wtf kind of teachers do you have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,once a girl winked and smiled at me i smiled and winked too later we had a great time and then she left in morning never to show up again dumb werent we
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a sex storm for your mom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the peoples elbow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and why can some people not smell it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,poontang pie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my guess is chef boyardee ™ brand ravioli
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes cooking a rock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always pictured bacon in a cast iron skillet i think its because its such a powerful scent that permeates the entire house
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rock bottom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,learn to just take it thats the only way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes i have learned to never cook bacon without a shirt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cmon dont be a pussy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but domesticated dogs have been around since caveman times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,historically speaking weve domesticated wolvesdogs far far longer to fill more roles than a horse does as an example we have used horses to pull carts and carry people in the arctic dogs do the same though they do not actually ride the dog now other way around when is the last time youve heard of a guard horse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is this pornhub that you speak of is it like ask jeeves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,page
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill go to the page of niche fetish site before the page of pornhub
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoa me too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes sense the relevancy of thier search results have been proven more consistent from page to page they use the google photovideo search results engine to power those sites more than likely equal relevancy rates when given like queries
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go back to facebook for a minute
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because reddit uses a random word decoder from wwii germany for trying to decode secret messages about how to make a proper cup of tea from the raf its pretty cool and it only cost like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoa ive never thought of that someone please explain this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mars may have soil capable of growing plants water there wont freeze within an hour and we wouldnt have to spend all of our energy heating ourselves there are many more reasons but those are the most prominent edit grammar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we totally do live in antarctica its not nice but theres lots weve learned about earth from having people stationed down there the knowledge we can learn about the solar system is worth the challenge of getting there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mars aint the kinda place to raise your kids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we can live in antarctica but we choose to dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,false there is a village in antarctica in that houses multiple families
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mars is full of resources
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we can use greenhouse gases and heat mars to a habitable temperature doing such to antarctica would destroy the rest of the planet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for the same reason we can explore it without having to have explored of earth first life is not a video game where we have to clear one planet to move on to the next
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but does mars have penguins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,again with the penguins 🐧
Showerthoughts,not_removed,asking the real questions here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,once we bring them there it will
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hopefully your mothers womb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hopefully not your bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one place is for sure gary indiana
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or just the area around her vagina in general
Showerthoughts,not_removed,superman is a plant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so were plants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well we dont get out energy directly from the sun we just eat things that do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a catch and release policy anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont worry it was just a metaphor like the dinosaurs were you silly heathen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude most of us thought of this by the time we were
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were all result of incest ewwwww
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except adam and eve werent the only people around at the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you made your account just to post this ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean jurassic park isnt real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe op is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,certainly explains a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no sadly not dinosaurs is all a big conspiracy thought up by big palaeo to make money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of pis digits is infinite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is an infinitesimal fraction of pis digits infinite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure why not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this a real thing i assumed it was made up for tv and movies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eh i get it im really really killer at a couple of reliable crowd pleasers its cool to be the oh shit is he making guac guy most of my friends are really good at one thing or another as well so we sort of form like voltron when its cookout time if youre curious about a guacamole trick i like to blend up some cilantro with salt and lime juice and a little bit of garlic powder and use that to control the consistency mixing it in while mashing the avocados by hand that way you can get it to the right level of slimy while still maintaining those nice chunks and you get the big cilantro flavor a lot of people just throw some pico in there and call it a day but the little extra hit of cilantro makes it great also never add your pico before you start mashing or the tomatoes will fuck everything up and it will look awful and have a weird texture i have no problem telling the internet that but its fun to keep a harmless secret from a friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only like minutes ago i had a really nice and easy meal at work for anyone who has a microwave only at work or at home minute rice pieces of mozzarella a sprout mix and a bit of teriyaki sauce on top of it was done in minutes tasted nicer than most of the stuff i eat at work is cheap and makes me feel good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a well guarded secret
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then the people that jump will be buried under the falling pieces of the building
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was because it was bombed from the insidethats not a typical situation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre free to disagree but i feel bad for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah when arnolds gone i dont know what im gonna do i dont even know who to look up to nowadays
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all was dedicated to mario kempes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,knowing most corporations it probably goes in the trash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everything goes in the ocean the dolphins are the real losers irl

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hope nobody uses it to find where my mother in law lives you hear that hackers you stay away from e st los angeles ca if you know whats good for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i must be brave or stupid probably both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you hit a year time to switch accounts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im going to be fucking daring as of but we shall see because that might be prematurely bold lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can you explain why someone would want to dox a reddit user outside of posting nudes or valuables in your home
Showerthoughts,not_removed,history in more sites than just reddit you can link a user and see all the posts and comments they made so you could find out that the same person who posts on crocheting also posts on fisting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if im interested in crochet and fisting on this account youll see me in the same places on my new one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you described it so well i mean its knitting and something else for me but yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theoretically if someone wanted to stitch together the evolution of your character theyd trace you from myspace all the way to linkedin they know you have that tattoo they thought your post was very insensitive they know you through time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe not quite that long but this babysitter i once had used to microwave shit for mad long
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bedbugs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets see if you fap once a day for a decade the average man produces around ml of sperm every time he fires thats faps or ml liters or almost gallons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone is going to do the math here you watch i fucking know it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reminds me of the music video in step brothers everytime i cum i produce a quart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you and every other male on the planet in their mid

Showerthoughts,not_removed,so in other words op isnt even close edit also rtheydidthemath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks was so curious about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was about to get pissed but then you threw in the gallons part so i knew how much were talkin bout
Showerthoughts,not_removed,once a day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even a small jacuzzi is so unless youve been masturbating times a day for years you havent filed a jacuzzi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gunna have an some exposed genitals and somewhat of a dress but only at your ankles lol so goofy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on your head or on your arms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks guys its all clear now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sorry but you appear to be in the wrong subreddit this is rshowerthoughts not raskscience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm it does not my chest is pathetic but my goonbox collection was the envy of all my peers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,asks science question about imaginary object
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the water pressure will be significantly higher than the ambient air that town is going under
Showerthoughts,not_removed,portals are a made up thing so sure definitely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for my imaginary world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah thats what im confused about if it was a funnel that the water needs to flow trough it wouldnt flow but its a portal so wouldnt it flow out because it teleports
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so it wont flood the city nice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my saved posts are porn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i introduced my best friend from outside school to my best friend at school at one of my birthday parties they became best friends shut me out and maintain that they met of their own accord why i have no idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always wondered how this would go my college friends are completely different from my old hometown friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is this a crossover episode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some people have so many friends that they can organize them in different friend groups til
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i keep very diverse and segregated groups of friends who have littletono contact with each other this year we held a bday party and finally after about years had most of these people in one place mostly they just ignored each other and kept to their groups it was disappointing in a boring way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha i bet that sure would be hilarious how to have friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i once had a tricrossover with friends from new zealand england and the us it seemed to ignite several rivalries and ended with them seeing who could roast me the best worst way ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how i will be watching my wedding reception next year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at first i was like hey thats cool then i started to realise wait who have i been in a crossover episode with and which friend of mine was the audience thats when it got trippy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is so true at my wedding it was so bizarre to see my extended family members and friends from different groups all dancing together like the end of a movie where you find out how all the characters in the different stories have been connected the whole time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some of them hate each other for the same reason how they rib you they get defensive of you lol whats really great is when the two that remind you of each other meet will they get along
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then you realize your friends are just movie characters you actually died years ago and your schizophrenic ghost just lies around and watches tv hoping that one day everybody from the office will meet the actors in napoleon dynamite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and its so awkward when youre the only one linking the two groups
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all my friends have different groups and cross with each other occasionally but i have no group im lonely and havent seen anyone outside my family in weeks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was my thought when i saw my childhood friends interact with my chilling group its funny to me because before these groups were separate cliques but now its a jumble of people with the same interests as the others
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just took all the people i liked and forged them into large friend group makes things a lot easier
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive occasionally had two friends from different groups interact with each other it always ends up with one or both of them asking why are you friends with them im not entirely sure how to take the fact that this keeps happening
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you abed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont worry as you get older youll lose all of your real friends and you wont have to worry about getting into awkward situations like this because youll keep every new person at a solid arms length after a certain point problem solved heh hehugh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone post the tmntpower rangers gif
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was a major source of anxiety for me in my early sports friends school friends partydrug friendsall best kept separate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i introduced friends back in highschool they took off and partied without me then years later the one stole my from me because im stupid and trusted the cunt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used mix the friend groups until they all started going on to create a hybrid friendship that never included me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or like dc and marvel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of my husbands best friends from childhood who is more or less a part of the family is married to a good friend of mine from graduate school they met through us it was really weird at first seeing my grad school friend show up at family functions and my husbands family friend show up at work functions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are killing independent george
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i have always viewed my life as a horrible and yet to be cancelled sitcom there are a few series regulars including myself of course plenty of guest stars and many costars as well as the universe of atmosphere who at any point can convert into dayplayers but you gotta tafthartly their ass if they blow audible wind your way with a potential of working their way up the cast i think it somehow makes life more interesting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my friend groups are radically different ages ones near my age one years older than me it was like the cross of a sit com and a cartoon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look at mr social over here with more then one friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chill abed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a brief definition of high school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes i feel like a shitty person because i try to make sure i have certain friends to never meet certain other friends but when that fails it gets ugly and awkward sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly how i felt when my cousins from my moms side met my cousins from my dads side
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a manager from my previous job start at my current job as my new manager after we hadnt seen each other in years it was strange seeing him with the current managers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youngpeopleproblems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look at this guy with his multiple friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,binge watching bojack horseman i take it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you havent already wait until you get married and everyone from every facet of your life is in place at time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when friends from different circles get together they usually just make fun of me until they can find some other commonality which does not always happen does that happen to anyone else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive introduced my regular gaming group of friends to my old group which i knowout since highshool and it was weird as fuck like sillicone valley crew meeting the craft group of chicks yes some of them are wiccan and goths and it was weird as fuck the goths were mostly glaring at the other group while the gilfoyle of the other group was being an asshole yeah no that was a terrible idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow some of you have two groups of friends i dont even have one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly how my wedding felt like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just wait till you see them naked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just wait till you see them naked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true and it usually sucks when i do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,remember those power ranger collab episodes yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they dont think i drink jim gaffagin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre killing independent george yeah theres definitely friend groups in my life that i dont want interacting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes ive never empathized with a shower thought more whats better is when they all become good friends with one another
Showerthoughts,not_removed,related when you see a friend you met in one place in a totally different place where you have different friends recently an east coast friend from university who moved out west came to visit we met up at a mall i used to go to as a kid talk about weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is so true i think about it all the time how i love when my friends from different groups collide and become good friends warms my heart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of my favorite shower thoughts ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ha its really funny introducing two of your good friends who dont know each other yet and seeing them not really be fully comfortable with one another yet im always internally going come on guys youre gonna love each other just skip this stupid initial formality phase
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it isnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha friend groups like people have more then one friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are movies more real to us than our real life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a fucking great way to put it showerthought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre gay two of your exes can meet through you and start dating each other happened to a high school friend of mine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think the biggest one is your regular friends group and your work friends group when worlds collide
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on seinfeld it was described as worlds colliding
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the other way around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive had this same thought its always weird when this happens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,two old friends from totally different friend groups are now dating and its weirding us all like your friend dating your sister
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also true with family reunions it felt sowl weird seeing my mothers side interact with my fathers side of the family
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always make the mistake of assuming all my friends know each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its crazy isnt it like you see them and its hard to determine if the person they are with you is the real them or that foreign entity over there is who they really are something to think about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,videos in this thread videocomment still alive did you see that ludicrous display last night pulls collar im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch ill keep this updated as long as i can httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get me on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so often a trainwreck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why i compartmentalize all the social aspects of myi usually dont like crossovers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this post can only lead to salty stories
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the weirdest thing is when you have a wedding suddenly your work friend is talking to your aunt and your best friend from grade is dancing with your motherinlaw worlds colliding everywhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my girlfriends calls this venning like a ven diagram
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had that same feeling the first time as a kid that i saw my dads parents together with my moms parents i never considered that they knew each other but they acted like old friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i live abroad and i have groups of friends with miles between them i am the sole connection between them and its the most bizarre feeling to image them meeting feels like two completely different lives whem im with each of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i once had a party with one half of elegant and sophisticated ballroom dancers and the other half were hardcore porn stars it was a very interesting party
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have had different friend groups
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol i couldnt see that going well did it for my bday and it just ends up in small groups with people usually coming to me the middle man to talk its blessed thought to have multiple groups the go out to bars groups the festival goers the travelers the gamers the stoners the philosophers my magic the gathering friends gym buddies musicians group etc in retrospective i went from socially awkward to having a lot of choice a group for every flavor of my diverse tastes keep a healthy social circle going but all of them togheter ah hell naw one topic at a time pls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nooooo never shall those groups interact thats like the cardinal rule of friend groups
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i met one of my best friends through a mutual friend that he had before he changed schools we met and immediately clicked i told my first friend that i was going to my new friends house one night and he just started laughing i was confused and he told me he found it funny that we met like two weeks ago and now were inseparable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,friend groups what are those
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont even have multiple friend groups
Showerthoughts,not_removed,friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or seeing your best friends interact with their other group of friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it really is thats a perfect way to put it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone has way more friends than me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is this a crossover episode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had thy experience at my wedding in september my family from poland meeting my husbands family meeting my family from here meeting my friends from home and my friends from here the weirdest experience of my life especially when all the friends and family from my side all started turning up to my house before the wedding some of them we were putting up some were helping out we had a massive pre wedding party it got weirder at the wedding when i see my husbands aunt trying to explain to my aunt who is and speaks no english whatsoever who they are and how theyre related to us so so weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i was talking to my friend in school the other day my girlfriend came over i had never seen the two interact before she asked him about a test or something it was so weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,colliding scenes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id like to see a study considering gender differences like how many male friends get along with other male friends compared to female friends getting along with other female friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this happened at my best high school friends wedding i introduced hi to his wife who was a college friend of mine there were our highschool friends my college friends and his marine buddies it was great sitting around a table with cigars and bourbon while everyone from all walks of our lives shared stories about the groom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see i just make one friend every years im slowly introducing them to each other so hopefully ill actually have a friend group
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i often think about this actually i wonder how different friends i have from completely different friend groups would interact with one another if they ever actually met i think there could potentially be some interesting interactions and combos and while they have something in common me as a friend its incredibly unlikely theyll ever meet unless i try to arrange it which would be kinda odd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love that feeling there must be a german word for it somewhere i remember being in town with my grandmother running errands or something when i was or and we bumped into my other grandmother my grandmothers knew eachother and had a lovely conversation it blew my tiny mind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,friend groups whats that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is it common to separate friends and not just merge them for a more the merrier attitude im currently struggling with one friend who refuses to spend time with my friends or to invite me when she does things with her other friends im not used to that and dont understand the point of separating people youre meant to be close to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the sense of humour doesnt come with the job its just the people we are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have parties at my house about times a year and we invite people from our separate personal lives and histories to come and hang out and eat smoked meat and have unlimited wine and drinks its awesome we have everybody from folks that i went to high school with in the to the guys who work in my shop and their wives to actuaries from my wifes former business life to her current work with phds in engineering and the various sciences last time we had one of the local college volleyball coaches some and bring a few of her players who were over what a sight with women who were at least in attendance we lay out all the food they can eat and huge amounts of booze and mixers i take pics at various times and its always a good time the mixing of friends is truly a joy its crazy who knows who in this town
Showerthoughts,not_removed,each one of us sees it as a different series i like this idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mutual hate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we met on our own at some weird kids birthday party years ago and we just hit it off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have introduced friends from separate groups together and had them kinda become best pals and withdraw from me once or twice once i introduced a guy i played magic the gathering with to my wife theyre getting married in june
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats kind of beautiful and awesome but also really tragic and shitty edit does that mean they shut you out of their friendship or shut you out as a friend completely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the flipside of this in my i still have friends who were childhood friends of my college girlfriend she wasnt particularly nice to us so now were friends and havent seen her in decades
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have an ex best friend like that introduced her to my best friend and another group of friends who she is much closer to now than me i miss her i struggled to stay friends with her for a year after years of friendship but she just resented me for any little thing i did i know i wasnt he greatest friend ever but i truly do care about her and i just dont think the relationship will ever be salvageable i havent spoken to her in two years i think about her all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my friend jane who i used to hang out with all the time introduced me to her friend sally then all of us hung out a lot for a while now sally and i hang out a lot and never see jane it wasnt intentional its just that now for some reason jane never answers either of our texts or calls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry to hear that hopefully things will work in your favor for now on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea i always introduced all of my new friend to my twin sister because i was more approachable and was pretty good at making friends she then turned them all against me and because shes pretty scary they all let her i kept thinking if i kept bringing new friends into the group they would defend me but they all turned too now i dont talk to any of my high school friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,introduced a gaming friend to another gaming friend one of them visited my country to meet the other friend neither of them told me i do feel annoyance at times for being exploited neither speak to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they own a honda
Showerthoughts,not_removed,something similar happened to me a friend from college introduced me a friend from his part of the city when i dropped out of college he was the only home really the rest of my friends were in college and he went a local school years later me and his friend still hang out more than the person that introduced us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this always scares me the most when melding my groups of friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i became close friends with someone person a that a formerly close friend person b introduced me to b has expressed that she feels sad that a and i are close and she has lost girl friends but b can be very hard to be friends with she plays the victim a lot the only feedback i ever gave her was to try to see things from other peoples perspectives today when she was mad at our boss and it made her cry a is the type of person that wants her friends to be friends with each other b feels threatened and jealous in the same situation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,similar thing happened to me but they didnt shut me out they just slowly drifted away together also they werent best friends but both were close friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this happened to me in middle school they stayed friends throughout high school and i never talked to them now were in college and theyre still friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol this happens a lot i introduced one work colleague to another both who i hung out with separately quite a lot now i never see them ah well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive been on the other side of this i was in elementary school and had just started at a new school where my best friend i had been friends with since i was born moms were best friends thats another fucked up story she had always been kind of mean to me well she introduced me to her friend group and they all hated me for being so close with her it was weird they all including best friend ignored me and kind of pushed me to the outer limits of the group where i met another girl that my best friend did that to we started hanging out and best friend doesnt like this and gets upset i stand up for the other girl and we have been best friends for years now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you a chick i dont know too many dudes who go through this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must be girls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt usually works fine if its just a party and lots of alcohol is consumed ive planned trips though with old hometown friends mixed with college friends for the most part it worked out fine but sometimes the older friends seemed to feel a little uncomfortable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im the friend in the group who is typically the butt of the joke and gets made fun of the charlie or dee if youre familiar with its always sunny in philadelphia when i introduced my college friends to my hometown friends it was just a barrage of them sharing embarrassing stories about me pranking me and they bonded quite nicely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lucky my college friends are also my hometown friends so i cant really experience this sometimes i feel i am just destined to be perpetually surrounded by the same idiots untill i drop dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes my college friends prioritize study above drinking and my hometown friends prioritize drinking above study its a nice mixture of intellectual fun and drinking a lot of beer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my home town friends think my college friends are really fucking weird and my college friends think my home town friends are really lame both groups love my boyfriend though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you might think theyre completely different but since you accepted each group as friends they surely have something in common that could make both groups friends or at least some i thought the same in college until i introduced both groups and we have a lot of crossover now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always wished i had old hometown friends i moved around a bit as a kid so i never really had longlasting friendships
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you change over time when you leave your hometown youre no longer obligated to continue being the person you were throughout childhood and high school so you and your friends in college will be pretty different almost instantly so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was looking for this thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,erica they dont allow you near children
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean you only need at a minimum people like for example your friends from your hometown and your friends from your college meet during spring break
Showerthoughts,not_removed,totally i have work friends drinking friends old school friends although those last two do overlap slightly but never the first one my work friends have very dark humour im talking dark humour they shouldnt mix with anyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its quite easy to have tons of friends in college it also depends on your definition of friends i have two different groups of college friends work friends because we hang out and shit and hometown childhood highschool friends theres also my sos friends which are not really my friends but i hang out pretty often with them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,over time youll develop lots of different kinds of friends through school work hobbies old room mates etc none of those people need to be your best friends per se but people you keep in contact with and occasionally hang out with i guess some people dont really care about meeting new people and whatnot so if youre like that then thats cool but if you feel like its hard to make friends then you should just put yourself out there more most people are more insecure about themselves than you think and i find that most people are actually really accepting as long as youre kind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre involved in different activities its quite easy the people i volunteer with are different from the people in my toastmasters club are different from the people in my writing group and thats just the folks in the town i moved to last summer ive lived in enough places that when a friend moves i can often connect them with someone else i know in their new home getting people i know would like each other is one of my favorite things im like a friendship yenta its so much fun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you dont live in the city you grew up in and arent a shutin its basically certain home friends college friends work friends and so on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it depends really on where you live in big cities its common for young people to have a ridiculous amount of friends simply because the social environment is totally different its common to go to a party with friends and knowing of the people there is the most your gonna get i noticed that in the suburbs most parties were consisted of everyone knowing everyone which i thought was totally weird i have my close neighborhood friends like roommates and best friends then i have my old club kid friends from chelsea then i have my friends in williamsburg hipsters gahh then i have my sketchy addict friends in the neighborhood then i have my old school friends from my old neighborhood then i have my friends from my college then i have my friends from the lower east side after a while it kind of just builds up i kind of swing in between the groups nobody necessarily belongs to any of these groups typically everyone has connections to multiple groups i always thought of it like this you have your main group of best friends not all of them are apart of the same group some of your best friends dont even like each other then you have youre coalition which is typically the people in the groups closest to you who hang out with each other often early on this is formed by neighborhood later by work and college i suppose my closest group the one people i identify me as belonging to is the friends i stay with the most of them being roommates we have an its always sunny thing going on sort of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you meet them all at different places i have like different friend groups which is kind of annoying lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the comment i was looking for and expecting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,life friends school friends work friends and then just friends not really about having that many more about where im forced to be in my day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have about a bunch of diffrent group of friends stuff like college friends hs friends martial arts friends sisters friends are also my friends work buddies turned close friends exgfs friends that still like me and hang with me neighbors and their friends etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not only have i maintained seperate groups of friends i ensure that i dont mix friends from different groups together i have friends who are gearheads gamer friends drinking friends gun nuts etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup have my old high school friends business friends and friends in the new city i live in at the time high school friends are the hardest to mix into any group as most of them havent done much with their lives the business and city friends have a lot of overlap as most are go getters and are ambitious in their own ways high school friends usually get uncomfortable as conversations usually drift towards workbusinessinvestments and they dont have much to contribute sometimes you really do outgrow people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not really social im and i have everyday friends i go out every weekend i know some of them since i was in total they are or so university friends high school male group high school women friends another group composed of eveyday friends female friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure like work mates vs friends you grew up with
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a group of friends i play video games and stuff with and a different group of friends who i go out and drinkparty with for example just different personalities my gaming friends dont like going to parties and vice versa i like both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant organize a friend group cause i dont have friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you only need a minimum of friends for this to happen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its like if your colleagues at work meet your soccer or any other sport teammates
Showerthoughts,not_removed,having a lot of friends can be good or bad you might never have nothing to do you might have a friend that will fix your car if you fix his computer etc but also rumors spread like the most vicious pancreatic tumor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck how can people have so many friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep exact same thing happens with me i have parties a year where theyre all invited and they rarely mix
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is how i imagine my funeral will go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are these friends everyone is speaking of im unfamiliar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey you got front seats to watch one hell of a crossover episode of your life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say put drugs in the punch bowl so you can really see a show
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think about this all the time who says im the main character and not just a guest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whenever you get invited to a party and theres people you dont know basically
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this summer my brother got married and and at the wedding we found out my aunt works with my brotherinlaws aunt my dad grew up with my brother in laws step father and some cousins were friends from school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh man i used to hate this one guy that my buddy brought around for that exact reason it always seemed like he was going way over the line but apparently it didnt bother anyone but me i ended up getting used to it but i still cant take it as far as he does hes fuckin ruthless its all in good fun though i know deep down hes a good guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its so much harder to keep track of all the lies with two groups
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a george divided against itself can not stand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly what i was looking for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahawhat was itworlds are colliding jerrysomething like that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the angent coulson
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like the nurse who appeared in daredevil and jessica jones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a real life that guy like some societal william fichtner i think i might be one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds exactly like me back in highschool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,want to talk about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly i talk to a lot of different people in school but only have contact with a few outside it can get a little weird in some classes too when you have to decide who to work with or go back and forth trying to talk to everyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what a rollercoaster
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that makes you the goto person to talk to from both sides get a very awkward when they wont talk to each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel yeah i know so many people and they talk to one another occasionally yet they rarely talk to me as if i am the last person they think of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have you tagged as will eat dog food if family is alive in fallout your son and butler were so maybe eat just a little dog food
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is oddly specific
Showerthoughts,not_removed,instead of feeling salty that people you introduced have better chemistry then you feel proud that you helped cultivate a connection just know that their friendship wouldnt have existed without you so in a way youre an inherent part of them and they probably still think about you a lot too because its unavoidable ive learned to play the role of matchmaker without hard feelings since we all have equal probabilities of becoming dead piles of dust eventually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn sounds a little too true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what episode is this ive seen every episode atleast twice but cant recall which this one is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow how dud you achieve that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds really fun if you like them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,british accent warning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its nice for those single people that need to meet new people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,must be it must have been all that cake i forced them to eat as they both became nutritionists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats like the time my uncle aunt on dads side husband and my mom cheated on my dad and his sister together and then got married i was like half a year old though so my unclenowdad raised me and i dont remember him ever being my uncle lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an mtg player stole your wife im sorry for you care to elaborate if you dont mind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hang in there man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your real life wife or is magic the gathering one of those second life things where you have a wife and overall better life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how did that happen so bizarre
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was a slow process but eventually i was literally forgotten and shunted into another friend group i got nice words about how we had drifted apart in my yearbook
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how in the world is it beautiful and awesome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,contact her worst case she rejects you but not knowing is more painful than assuming or not trying good luck friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like a relationship would you really want to love someone who doesnt really care for you by all means reach out and see what happens but id be careful youre setting yourself up for disappointment you should just be prepared
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im so sorry about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guys dont talk about it when it happens to them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my old friends think im a drug addict cause my college friends are super into music festivalsjam music etc i smoke weed and thats pretty much it unless i have a whole weekend away from responsibilities drink much much less too one of my best friends from high school was super drunk after a wedding and turns to me on the street and starts crying omg youre addicted to drugs im standing there sober and confused as all hell uh no im not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i find it hard to mix groups like that i have work friends and i have sports friends i am sure that my work friends would think my sports friends are a bunch of hicks conversely my sports friends would think my work friends are uppity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always found it funny that i would always get along with my friends friends really well but then when i would try to bring one of my other friends to another friend group they were rejected and i was usually told that they liked hanging with me but not my other friend this became kind of problematic because i ended up having several friend groups that were all awesome but could never interact with each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nothing brings people together like ridicule of someone else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i went to college with several of my friends from high school i made it a point to ignore them and make new friends the first semesters and it was the best thing i ever did i eventually started hanging with my old friends but i have so many more friends from college as a result
Showerthoughts,not_removed,really pretty much every intelligent person i went to uni with consumed ridiculous amounts of alcohol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,redditor for months guys he checks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how the fuck do you even find a reference like this to your username in a sea of posts and an even larger ocean of comments
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i also happened to be vigorously scanning over the page with my eyes trying to seek out the present information as well i give my thanks to you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for helping the class
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is a show called bojack horseman and the line what is this a crossover episode is a running joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats doing his best
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can do it with two people if they change personalities depending on context
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have more than friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you only need friends to get the same thing that this post is about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where do you work because my office is filled with dead fish in terms of humor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you work in a mortuary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agreed you get some friends from school college and university even friends youve made outside of school etc it depends on your definition like you said i find it kind of weird introducingwhen different friend groups spend time together because we all have different funny stories and inside jokes we can throw in but then some of the group doesnt know awkward for them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its quite easy to have tons of friends in college that assumes that everyone has the typical college experience i did not live on campus i had a family already and i worked full time so my college experience was much like the rest of my adult life lots of scheduling and planning ahead rushing around and keeping my fingers crossed that everything lines up and nothing collides to this day i really dont socialize much im cool with it though shrug theres always reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no i mean i get it its kind of a joke but it is a joke based in reality since i have two people i actually consider friends i have many coworkers im friendly with but i only have two people i ever socialize with outside of work and as you say im totally cool with that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not really social everyday friends i go out every weekend in total they are or so do you know the meaning of social
Showerthoughts,not_removed,joining clubs talking to your coworkersclassmates maintaining contact with old friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i dunno how people do it in my case i kinda keep to myself mostly and i dont do big groups of friends which is kinda why most of these people had never met eachother in the first place even though theyre great friends of mine for a long time more direct answer mostly from working at good places meeting people there and becoming friends and then meeting their friends etc sometimes people just seem to start inviting you to stuff even though you didnt really consider friendships with them its all really random and unpredictable much like meeting a partner you cant really plan it it just happens edit a bit of back and forth goes a long way if you get invited to something try to invite them back to something else this is probably the way to show people you are interested in being a friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,talk to people in your environment be friendly and get out of toxic environments where you are not welcome practice makes perfect it takes some luck ill give you that but if you put yourself out there its not that hard try to engage in environments where people tend to be social and share interests and age range class is the ideal setting for this but if you missed your shot in high school and or college then enroll in some classes for some hobby you may have visit events for something that piques your interest hang out in a store that sells those specialized books you like to buy or i dont know try to talk to the barista at your local corner coffee shop if you throw enough balls out there someone ought to catch one of them eventually also redditfacebooksocial media in general is a shell and the more time you spend on it the less chances you are going to get of forming real relationships get out more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im in college so its pretty easy to make a lot of friends but class i take classes usually with few of the same people in themi go to a large university roughly work friends of current friends clubs that random person i met at that party and they were chill so i hit them up tinder random passerby that you struck up a convo with and hit it off i tend to regular certain bars so other regulars and neighbors are a few
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont confuse friends with acquaintances i know a great many people because at ive either studied partied or worked with them maybe we met when i was on vacation or even a bus i moved so often in my i dont even remember some of my roommates names even though we used to get along great id say im friendly with hundreds of people real friends however id say everyone else is just an acquaintance with varying degrees of familiarity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,moving to another area can get you hometown friends and new home friends graduating from high school then going to college you can have work friends and non work friends etc theres a lot fo ways to have different groups of friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im an introvert and even im surprised with the number of friends i have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive found it works better if you introduce onetwo at a time to another friend group more is possible but it requires alcohol or a common interest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are they like these so called potatoes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a tv series about a group of people that share a bond i dont understand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would be one episode of cops i would tape
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow thats kinda depressing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well you can be a main character in one film a guest star in another and a cameo or an extra in another who says you arent in three films at the same time were all actors of some form or another and sometimes actors have more than one job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,easy did you organize the event
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre not the main character in your own life youre doing something wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which is why whenever friends from different groups are gonna be meeting for the first time i make sure were doing something easiest way to avoid awkwardness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you know popular people are i fact only popular because they them self seeking contact with other people before i read this study i also thought there was some hidden force but in fact there is none to get popular you just have to stay in contact with everyone you meet then on the other side im sure you too like me are just introverted and dont have any real interests in most people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,huh small reddit world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seems like a pretty generic hypothetical to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats great unless they shut you out thats where it hurts yeah you helped people become friends but you lost two friends because of it big price to pay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i must know as well please tell me when you know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,deleted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just invited everyone whenever i was doing something people eventually met and got to know each other not everyone meshed but worked well enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love that shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,definitely it was fun and it was good for my husband to have someone he knew when surrounded by my fellow grad students when all we did was complain about grad school or geek out over things that sounded like a foreign language to him it just always made me do a double take in the first year or two
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats true its just most of the time people bundle up and dont cross talk if the person wants to meet new people though surely they will make the effort its just human nature to bundle up in the familiar groups
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha see a true friend pushes real friends to a cliff and teaches them to fall
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shoulda stuck with coke coke makes em stay cake makes em go away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell them they will never be dietitians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as long as he didnt ask you to call him uncle daddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the aristocrats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats the relationship like between your mom and her sister
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im gonna need to get a pen and paper for this one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my greatgrandparents wife swapped it was oklahoma both couples already had children before they swapped and had a couple more as a result i have two half uncles who both have the same three halfbrothers but those two themselves arent related to eachother it looks kinda like this if they share a letter they share a parent h f have two sons my grandfather and a m have one son am then they swap h m have one son hm a f have one son af so the children of these marriages are am hm and af as i said this was oklahoma in the not much else to do back then i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my greatgrandparents wife swapped it was oklahoma both couples already had children before they swapped and had a couple more as a result i have two half uncles who both have the same three halfbrothers but those two themselves arent related to eachother it looks kinda like this if they share a letter they share a parent h f have two sons my grandfather and a m have one son am then they swap h m have one son hm a f have one son af so the children of these marriages are am hm and af as i said this was oklahoma in the not much else to do back then i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he introduced a guy he played magic the gathering with to his wife theyre getting married in june
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was just as shocked as you are at that sentence hell i didnt even know they were a thing until almost a year into their affair when i caught them he came over to hang out one night a few weeks after i had caught her in an affair we were trying to work things out but she was the cheating kind apparently it really boiled down to the fact that the guy made a year more than i did at the time and was silvertongued he took all the stuff i had told him while we were friends and turned it into this elaborate bullshit story said id been having an affair and had been fucking this girl id been dating like years ago either the guy blocked her on my exs facebook one day or my ex had done it previously and just forgot because he used the fact that she was blocked on there as evidence she didnt even live in the same time zone anymore but my ex didnt bother to find that out until she was on her way out the door i know that the marriage would have probably ended sooner rather than later but he definitely made it his duty to speed it up and make it messy for me im happier now and ive been working through all of it i know now that they deserve each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who elaborate you know how those smooth talking slick mtg players are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now im happy after reading all these stories here that i have friends living far from each other and never interacting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im hanging for sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol my real life wife
Showerthoughts,not_removed,life is bizarre
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ohhhhh this happened in high school makes more sense now teenagers are all fuckboys every one even the girls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just playing devils advocate here could it be that you became weirdly jealous of their budding friendship started acting strange and possessive of one or both of the friends i only ask because i was involved in a similar situation friend introduced me to another friend we really hit if off original friend got jealous and started dropping comments about us hanging out too much without him we happened to both share a love for an odd tabletop game and played a lot other friend was never interested and got really weird about us enjoying something without him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you im going to look her new address up and write her a long letter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agree she was more like family to me than a relationship though the main reason i backed off was because it seemed to pain her more to hang out with me than if i just became the bad guy and walked away nothing i did seemed to make it better i do need to reach out even though like you said she probably wont want to rekindle anything thank you for the advice and kind words though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well finally the entire internet was waiting to see if you felt bad for her verdicts in folks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you its really for the best though i dont need disloyal friends anyway and im hopeful that my sister come around eventually ive waited this long whats a few more years plus i have new real friends who support me life is looking up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure that being said im still inclined to believe its a issue that girls come upon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it sucks but i think its pretty common especially with work friends you dont choose the people you work with so you end up with a pretty eclectic group that your normal friend group prob wouldnt be into hanging around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you pointedly ignored people you had a relationship with
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats fucked up you purposely left your loyal friends for new exciting people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how did your friends take being ignored if you spent a year ignoring them you changed the relationships you had with them for better or for worse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say that has more to do with their major and the stress theyre feeling wasnt much of a drinker in highschool would go to parties but really only have a couple beers now a senior in undergrad and about to go to pharmacy school i have progressively drank more often as it went on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blind luck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtotallynotrobots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair if he wasnt aware of bojack op could be interpretted to be very confused about the term crossover episode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my mom changes personalities when she talks to my southern family members suddenly she starts talking with a suthern twayng
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can do it by yourself with imaginary friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rnocontext
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i find dead fish to be hilarious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we probably work together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they work at the carwash woah woah woah woah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in hungarian we have a word for close friends barát and a different word for drinking friends or friends that you are not very close or connected with haver
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its like were twins i have to run my life the same way due to workschoolhome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just admit it youre a loser s naw i feel you though my really close core group of friends is really all i need but i somehow always find myself trying to make time for new people work friends and stuff honestly its probably more likely that im the lonely one since im always seeking more people to hang out with which is weird because i actually really enjoy my alone time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its an organization where people improve their public speaking and leadership skills
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see theres my problem i dont like most of the people i meet at any of those things not enough to want to spend time with them outside of what ever thing has forced us to interact ive met exactly people at work im remotly comfortable with knowing my home address
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get out of my house
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i got that reference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apparently is from the bizareo jerry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually a true friend would push friends off a cliff to force them to learn how to fly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,coke makes me do many things staying put is not one of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless you sprinkle come coke on the cake then theyll stay and maybe even clean your house
Showerthoughts,not_removed,coco
Showerthoughts,not_removed,coke as in cocaine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a confusing family tree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dad is an identical twin and when i was young id call my uncle uncle daddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no but my older brother who actually grew up with the parents together did sometimes to make him mad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this the brodeur family
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sisterinlaw it was his fathers sister
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt know she had a sister
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes marrying the guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats rotten man you deserve so much better and i hope you recognize that and it doesnt make you bitter about people hopefully in twenty years youll be looking at what happened as the start of an amazing new point in your life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry to hear that glad youre better off but a couple things i think if she so easily believed him that isnt a good indicator anyway im guessing they got pretty close prior to that happening hope you beat that guys ass or did something at least
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you win the mtg match tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,notallteenagers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can see where you are coming from but no i dont think ive ever been the possessive type i will admit they had a lot in common and i was a little jealous of their relationship but im pretty sure i never acted like i didnt want them to hang out or anything there was another instance where i had sets of friends and because of the friends in group fell out with in my other group i was given an ultimatum to pick a group and not talk to the other i went with the group that didnt give me the ultimatum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,clearly they didnt appreciate the strength
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your right my comment was pointless deleted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a lot of people youre friends with in high school arent actually your friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like i said above ignore may be too strong of a word i just made a point to do other things besides go clubbing all week and go home every weekend most of them made friends with or dated people i introduced them to and i honestly never heard anything negative or resentful from them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the term predates bojack by a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i very very rarely rewatch shows for the same reason but i actually loved rewatching bojack watch the background theres actually a lot of hilarious things happening that you miss the first time through
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my wife says i do it apparently around most people i talk with less of an accent and around family i speak with more of one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think thats just natural my dads aussie accent comes out a lot more when hes speaking to his family
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well you will be laughing a lot in the coming years when the oceans boil
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just admit it youre a loser ahh you got me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the trick is to try to hit the ground and miss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,falling is a lot like flying just with a more permanent destination
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but flying is just falling with style
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have your coke and eat it too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,man im in love with the coco
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always been curious whats the record on family trees looping on themselves so mom bangs son produces boy and girl boy and girl bang grandmother and their father producing more who then bang how far have humans pushed incest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its like a game of crusader kings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ha ive never thought about that but i can see how that could be really confusing for a child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hapsburg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and maybe get into pogthose guys never steal anyones girl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is really nicely put
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say that i didnt kick his ass on principle but really i just never had a chance again he stayed away from me after i basically threatened to blow his brains out if he ever came around again after i found out after i cooled down i just made sure that when everything ended no one had any ammo to ever say anything bad about me in relation to this whole ordeal he lost his best friend who was also his supervisor at work and she lost all but one of her close friends because neither one of them thought theyd done anything wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no but he accidentally left half of his collection and a laptop in a backpack miles from home a few weeks after we met so i won the war
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha i meant in a good sense im cool making awful dark humor comments about the whole situation is my way of getting over it my whole marriage was a joke and i need to embrace that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yesallteenagers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes right though im currently in highschool and i can verify that everyone including myself is a fuckboi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes this i wanted to make sure they were the people i wanted to associate with the four more years also i think ignore may have been a little strong we all lived on campus in dorms spread apart by a mile or more i still made it to birthday celebrations and such just made it a point to meet new people and do new things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree i didnt say bojack invented it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the animation team is fantastic it was more animal punsjokes in the first season and they did a lot more wordplay in later seasons something i didnt notice the first time through the agency princess carolyn works for is called vigor she leaves to start her own called vim
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do the same i dated a girl last year who moved to my state california from georgia and after spending a lot of time with her i started to say yall a lot i still say it to this day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how to prove youre a complete failure at everything even at killing yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you might find rcrusaderkings interesting the secret phrase is xwedodah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty far actually it can be proven mathematically that a whole lot of incest went on in the past
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ask britain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gotta keep it in the family
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice taking the long view good on yeh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i assumed it was a joke glad to see you taking it in stride at least now you can focus on people who truly care about you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but he certainly perfected it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yall is just such a useful pronoun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the trick mr potter is not minding that it hurts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no ask the habsburgs httpxenohistorianfaithwebcomeuropeimagescharlesiiinbreedingjpg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,into kinky cosplay i see im not one to judge
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know people didnt live as long back then but its still crazy to see that just about every one of them only made it about years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes that is exactly what it does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes so obviously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go to youtube and check out the numberphile channel they have loads of videos about mathematical theories like this and they actually answer your exact question very well in one of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the universe is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only for people who arent good at math like me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who the fuck says that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was once told that i say fuck too much i replied it seems to me that you dont fuck enough it was some shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of my favorite quotes from my internship over the summer say the fbomb in front of your mother shed slap every tooth out of your mouth but on a construction site fuck is just like any other word
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know what fuck them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apparently theres a window in life when its acceptable to say fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were told that because very few can handle the power of fuck with great fuck comes great responsibility its one of the few words that everyone says but it doesnt lose power or become meaningless lets fuck fuck me can possibly initiate sex and even if the sayer isnt serious if a woman says fuck me it grabs your attention fuck you almost inevitable doesnt fail to initiate a fight someone could call you asshole or a bastard and nothing may happen but fuck you is the magical phrase to get fist flying or it ends a fight but its also a greeting or a send off or the go to word when some shit goes down house is on fire well fuck that gf boned another dude well fuck this fuck is just the magical human phrase drop and f bomb attention will be got
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the fuck am i reading
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck em
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck me daddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuckers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck it fucking annoys me when fuckers fucking use fuck so fucking often in a normal fucking conversation it fucking takes them three fucking times as long to fucking say a fucking thing fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck you no no no no fuck me buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck it all and fuck a fucking brat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fucking people i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nobody eh the fairy fucking godmother said it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but good shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck you too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah fuck them right in the pussy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fug indeed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sorry meowmixsong but im not real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that escalated quickly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know right fucking fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck man all you need to say to those people is could you give less of a fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck us all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah woah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and ops mom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were all fucked on this blessed day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,speak for yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now i miss jumper cable guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if their dads beat them with the cables
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,deodorant doesnt increase your chances of getting laid it decreases your chances of fucking it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you sure the deodorant is not a secret weapon from the government to prevent me from having sex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how does it increase the chances of fucking up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh shit i didnt think about that pretty sure its not though but maybe its like some sort of alien conspiracy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it decreases your chances of fucking it up people dont walk around around smelling someones armpits thinking that someone with good smelling armpits is who they wanna fuck but if you arent using it and lift your arms and that person smells some rank shit theyre probably gonna back out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha ok i misread i read your sentence like two or three times though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not a parent but have you ever been around a toddler who hasnt napped little hell spawns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kids need rest during the day and with proper care and a steady routine its not hard to put them to bed at night those that do complain that its hard its cus they dont do things right i am a parent my kid takes a nap around noon and sleeps around pm just about every night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you just figured that out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so where did the roast beef come from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with the help of urobotyoshimis i just figured it out too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except actually people win at gambling flushing the toilet might get you some shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and some more of it from my neighbors toilet too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the idea homey that a million people flushed that dollar including myself and got of them back its a lottery for stupid people unless youre not stupid and just statistically lucky point is as op says toilet wins either way op is leaving out a lot a fuck ton of free liquor beautiful women and the most powerful of them all hope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not double not triple try times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if all paper started out at maybe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about harvey herschel korman as hedley lamarr in mel brookes blazing saddles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well thats kinda antisemitic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,suggestions about israeli popular movies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,found the guy with the foot fetish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well finding enjoyment in having a pedicure and wearing nice footwear is quite different from feeling sexual arousement for feet taking care of how you look is not always an encouragement to sexual advances of any kind still theres nothing wrong with foot fetish in my opinion and if youre dating a woman whos open to this kind of kink good for you just do not expect every wellgroomed lady to be open to this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called a fetish because most people arent into it its different people dont like different
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in response to the rhistory post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if north south east and west are terms we use to give directions relative to ours so yes theyre below above and to the left or right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no states are left and right depending on the direction you are facing countys are over yonder where your cousins live
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i dont give a shit am i constipated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i dont give a damn am i an angel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre an angel does that make you holy shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that why taco bell tastes like ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this gives a whole new meaning to eating ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because it carries the rice beans and other goodies to your mouth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah this is true holy crap spanish was my first language and i never noticed this either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it just hit me reading a thread about a large burrito on the front page when someone made a joke calling it just a burro id link it but im on mobile and lazy seriously blew my mind though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,arent you your cousins cousin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have permission to bonk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless its you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,could not would your moms sister is your aunt your aunts husband is a nonbloodrelated uncle your uncles brother could have a kid who would be normally be your nonrelated cousins cousin but if your uncles brother married your sister still technically nothing wrong with that then your cousins cousin would be your nephew or niece
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why give me an example
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eaten spoken showered slept murdered
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also a murderer may be innocent therefore if the death penalty were in place it would eventually result in innocent people dying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,personally i think here are circumstances that it should be allowed i just dont think it should be an approved form of birth control
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what makes abortion ethical in my country it isnt allowed at all also i guess you can compare allowed abortions to self defense killings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pro choice and against the death penalty i am also a neuro researcher my personal position is the following unborn humans have not developed a world model or consciousness to a degree that i would consider giving them the same status as i would a developed person abortion is in a sense the same as taking a person off of life support because they are brain dead as for being against the death penalty i believe free will to be a nonsensical outdated idea we are all the sum of our histories and as such blame becomes a misnomer murder is an unfortunate event and we should work as a society to minimise the behaviour but murdering murderers does not reduce the amount of murdering it is just an antiquated form of retribution
Showerthoughts,not_removed,murderers are still people zygots are not people the death sentence costs the state a ton of money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve heard people seriously arguing that murderers arent people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because theres a difference between a potential life and a realised one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in those rare cases the death penalty could be waived unless there is beyond circumstantial evidence by murderer i mean caught red handed or was wearing the persons skin when they caught them serial killer with multiple kills etc no so much guys girlfriend was strangled theyre sure its him so hes going to jail for life anyways but their is a in a million chance he could be innocent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay so let me ask you at what point does someone become a developed person at what point does killing a child become not okay third trimester birth months their first word should parents be allowed to abort children after taking them home if they decide they no longer want them should parents also be given the option to abort children who turn out to have significant mental disabilities where do you draw the line and why is keeping alive someone who skinned teenagers alive better than keeping alive an unborn child and its not so much about retribution as it is about you paying for a deranged murder to live out their life comfortably in a cell executions can be quite a bit cheaper and were prior to the amount of bureaucracy now involved than keeping someone in a cell for years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you not give up your humanity when you take someones life and are you arguing the unborn children arent people what makes someone people at what point does killing a child become not okay third trimester birth months their first word should parents be allowed to abort their children after theyre born if they change their minds the moment they get home httpwwwabortionprocedurescom made me question the ethics behind abortions i dont think it should be an approved form of birth control without sufficient evidence that you are incapable of caring for a child also their are lots of couples like me and my wife who cant naturally have kids why not give them the option to adopt newborns the death penalty used to be cheaper before a huge amount of bureaucracy was involved a bullets a dollar and a funeral is prison costs around per prisoner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you not give up your humanity when you take someones life and are you arguing the unborn children arent people what makes someone people at what point does killing a child become not okay third trimester birth months their first word should parents be allowed to abort their children after theyre born if they change their minds the moment they get home httpwwwabortionprocedurescom made me question the ethics behind abortions i dont think it should be an approved form of birth control without sufficient evidence that you are incapable of caring for a child also their are lots of couples like me and my wife who cant naturally have kids why not give them the option to adopt newborns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so the guy who skinned alive teenage girls before killing them has more of a right to live than any unborn child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you not give up your humanity when you take someones life no a raving maniac attacks me i kill him to defend myself am i now inhuman soldiers from another city invade my town killing and raping my neighbours i cut the throat of their commanding officer am i inhuman my violent husband attacks me constantly one night he goes after my son i crack his skull with a frying pan am i inhuman there are hundreds of situations where killing someone could become necessary from a certain point of view and many of those would fit the definition of murder just because someone has committed a criminal act does not mean they are a malicious person and are you arguing the unborn children arent people no i never said that at what point does killing a child become not okay neural activity is usually detected in around the week so id say you should have the option to terminate your pregnancy within the first weeks however this isnt any sort of actual thought its just electrical activity so i have no moral qualms with stretching that a little further because its not like you get a notification on your phone when you get pregnant should parents be allowed to abort their children after theyre born if they change their minds the moment they get home thats a nice strawman and all but it is a strawman nonetheless you give them up for adoption at that point why not give them the option to adopt newborns because carrying a baby for months isnt riskfree and neither is giving birth the death penalty used to be cheaper before a huge amount of bureaucracy was involved a bullets a dollar and a funeral is prison costs around per prisoner part of the reason it is so expensive is they spend a fair amount of money making sure theyre executing the right person if you just shot someone a week after theyd been condemned it could very easily turn out that they were innocent after all i firmly believe being deprived of all basic human freedom for the rest of your living days is far worse than being executed thats not living thats existing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibeginningofhumanpersonhood is very much a topic of ongoing debate im not arguing one way or another about whether abortion is murder but a very common argument justifying it is that a fetus is just a collection of cells and not a person i dont think that argument is very applicable to murderers they may have given up their rights as a citizen even their right to live but they are pretty clearly people can you talk to an adult in your native language and be unsure if youre talking to a person or not a murder is an act in your past if you get away with it and never tell anyone are you a nonperson at that point is personhood more of a theological judgement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,using it for space travel might have been cool talking like the chipmunks definitely was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not really a problem as they do not use high quality pure helium its recycled from the gas which is used in the medical industry and mixed with air its known as balloon gas rather than helium for that reason
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one day fusion maywill be a widespread source of power and helium is a byproduct of it so maybe its not doomed d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt someone just discover a huge source of helium in africa recently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,last time this was posted someone i think who worked with mri machines pointed out that the helium used for balloons and such is not pure its unusable for those scientific purposes that make helium important so no balloons are not a waste of helium ill look for that post and link if i can find it e holy balls there are a lot of posts about this and i cant find the specific one i was referring to but i did read through many of them and will try to give a quick run down of the points that keep getting mentioned and had sources provided i am not a scientist if someone with more knowledge comes in and points out things that i have said as being wrong i would believe them over me theres more than one common use for helium in science those who complain of balloons are referring to the use of helium as a coolant for superconductors this may actually be wrong i do not know enough about the subject to stand behind this some mention needing for supercooling i dont know this isnt as big a deal as some would lead you to believe for a couple of reasons one being that superconductor technology is improving very rapidly so the need for supercooling is shrinking two being that the shortage of this type of helium is partially artificial both the us and russia stockpiled helium during the early cold war but no longer have much need of it for some reason trade issues keep being mentioned as a reason the price sometimes jumps helium is a natural byproduct of the processing of natural gas which is apparently still abundant enough that it is not a concern the balloon market makes up such a small amount of overall helium use that even if we were to stop using it in balloons it would have an almost unnoticeable impact on worldwide helium use often when people are speaking of helium use for scientific purposes they arent speaking about the helium used in balloons but are speaking of which is the stable isotope version of helium and is indeed rare however there is an abundance on the moon due to there being no atmosphere to shield it links to other good posts on this subject
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and blow up dolls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt they just find a bunch more edit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a myth we are not running low on helium we are running low on the surplus supply of helium that the us government slowly sold and the helium sold is no good for science anyways it is basically helium that is not suitable for mri machines and other uses and other sources of helium are being found all the time and if we really wanted to we could synthesize helium like substances and we have other substances that are equal or better than helium albeit more expensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not a waste floating things are awesome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too bad we will not be able to do it in one of those funny heliuminduced voices
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they just found a huge previously unknown reserve of helium we are no where near to running out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i aint explaining anything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not me im going to use it for suicide problem solved
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if were running low on helium then im sure that would be the least of our concerns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if the helium in a balloon slowly leaks out doesnt it end up back in our atmosphere where it started we didnt really use it more just borrowed it for a minute right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget when people inhaled it to make them sound high pitched xd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no we wont theyll care about helium then as much as regular people care about any other noble gas today which is not at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,looking at you cleveland
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its basic supply and demand if we start to run out of helium it will become too expensive to waste in balloons besides its produced whenever an atom undergoes alpha decay so were never going to run out its also not really lost since its still in the atmosphere somewhere if it gets rare and expensive it would become economically worthwhile to mine it from the upper atmosphere using automated devices on solarpowered hydrogen dirigibles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is funniest thing ive read all day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what would chipmunks sound like if they could talk and had helium worse than those fucking alvin chipmunks i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my god what have i been inhaling at parties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe in the future energy will be the byproduct o
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the well just destroy all our water to make hydrogen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,these kinds of threads are like when ignorant bleeding hearts start crying about golf courses or any large business wasting precious water during a drought they point out how that water should be conserved and used to provide hydration to people or some other noble endeavor of course they fail to understand that the gallons of water used in large fields is typically reclaimed water and reclaimed is just a nice way of saying sewage which is completely unsuited for human consumption
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so a finite resource being spent frivolously isnt wasting it thats like saying crude oil can be wasted because it isnt refined
Showerthoughts,not_removed,god no wonder they always talk funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,iirc its used in mri machines or some sort of medical diagnostic device
Showerthoughts,not_removed,helium is so light that once released in the open it floats away from us and into the universe earths gravity cannot keep the helium inside its atmosphere edit most of our helium is underground with the natural gas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people can be very ignoble at times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except the helium used in balloons is unusable for the things that makes helium special its far from pure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,legal recycled drugs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and bacon will fly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,god dammit what are we gunna do with all this fuckin energy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no electric bills bro thats even better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean i sort of but in fairness the only difference between potable and reclaimed water is treatment and the grass breeds used on courses have pretty high water consumption levels that and helium released into the air actually exits the atmosphere so its not really that similar to pouring out a few thousand gallons of water that rejoins the water table helium used in balloons is literally lost to our planet and theres no sources generating it other than giant balls of fire in space i mean i like balloons but it seems a little weird that we fill them with a currently irreplaceable substance i have also been annoyed by ignorant bleeding hearts but it doesnt mean we couldnt stand to do a much better job of conserving resources
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im passing along the things i have learned from reading posts the many times this has been brought up on reddit im not stating my opinion if you have a different opinion or any good information to add thats great dont shoot the messenger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the topic title uses we like this we as in we the human race wow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unusable is too strong a way to put it if it were economically feasible people would recycle it with distillation or chemistry or other methods recycling is just not the cheapest source of the pure stuff right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,read that in chandlers voice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bio engineering is also on the rise you know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only difference is treatment thats a pretty big fucking difference we have an abundance of untreated water everywhere except a select few desert climates treatment is virtually the only expense attached to water aside from infrastructure if anything with risks of rising sea levels the planet actually has too much of that particular natural resource
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the point is that attitude is harmful to the conservation of a finite resource i for one would like to be able to get an mri fifty years from now and the attitude that its okay to not recycle helium will prevent that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,desalinating seawater is incredibly resource intensive and expensive we are draining freshwater aquifers far faster than they can replenish or filter groundwater pulling water thats been accumulating for millions of years each year potable water usage increases but regeneration rates either remain unchanged or decline surface level groundwater is increasingly polluted in places with porous geological features on top of that as underground reservoirs get lower and lower the stone they previously supported starts to collapse generating massive sinkholes if we can develop a low cost high volume method of desalinating water then yes well be fine but as it stands potable freshwater supplies are one of the first things we stand to run out of water may become a much more expensive commodity unless we do something more productive than drilling deeper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the passing along of information is harmful huh til i guess please dont take it personally if i choose to disagree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when the information makes people feel less guilty about frivolously wasting a finite resource it is its perpetuating a problem rather than helping to find a solution for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so then refute the information go online research the topic post the info that you find thats all i did and it took all of minutes to do i never claimed my own opinion just relayed information you are free to do the same complaining about someone sharing information is no offense a very ignorant thing to do i think your problem isnt really with me its that the information goes against your point of view im not an expert and im not pushing an opinion you cant argue an opinion against facts if you have any facts that support your opinion please post them thats how this works id be happy to read more about the subject so that i can be better informed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to think nyc was like this and its partially true not to the extent of vegas though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i live here thats true but as a fellow local im sure like me you avoid that party like the plague until friendsfamily visit of course
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ditch the strip and join us at frankies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill be there in july from wi looking forward to it any advice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a manly handshake is a firm grip and a look into the eyes making a blade with your hand is weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,handshakes are supposed to inspire a sudden burst of reassurance i dont think a karate chop would do that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unfortunately i know too much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess if you equate nudity with sex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can only draw stick figures with realistic eyes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,verbal is like of your communication nonverbal is the other s is definitely needed sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its hard to tell on the internet sometimes especially when youre not familiar with the person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what an amazing observation thats soo true like all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on reddit you are kidding its like a collection of really stupid people in some subreddits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh sure i totally agree with you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rubber ducks are supposed to be cute ducklings are cute ducklings are yellow rubber ducklings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,baby ducks are yellow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id assume because of when theyre smaller or are baby ducks not yellow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ducklings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this question needs to be answered by an expertufuckswithducks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it kind of makes sense sexual intercourse simply requires physical compatibility like a round peg going into a i guess not necessarily round hole on the other hand stds require biological compatibility to spread
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why do you think he was such good friends with mccoy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they addressed this in voyager kim as he usually does falls in love with whatever woman is nice to him but this woman was vastly alien on the inside janeways orders to the entire crew were basically dont fuck the aliens but kim didnt listen and got a horrible std
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe he was using spocks condoms vulcanised rubber
Showerthoughts,not_removed,klingonnorhea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called plot prophylactic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get long and prosper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wellthat we know of that would make a poor story line probably a few hundred multiple per alien
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not particularly considering the many races were seemingly httpmemoryalphawikiacomwikiancienthumanoid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe describe it more as a flesh stick into a flesh sleeve sheath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was going to say advanced medical technology probably kept everyone squeaky clear no spread
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey thats pretty good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant take credit for it its an old joke from friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shut up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i talk to myself all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,validation is the strongest drug there is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why its so popular amongst those that couldnt find validation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called a prenup
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because its a losing bet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they arent going to insure you for something that you can make happen and just walk away with their money and no consequences if you want to collect on your car home or life insurance you at least have to wreck your car burn down your house or kill yourself you could get married get divorced collect on the marriage insurance and still continue to see each other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my words exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true but that requires consent of the other party and can be undone in court there should be insurance that anyone can buy without the permission of your spouse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats really sad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its this actually a genuine shower thought did you have this thought while washing your hair
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably cause after you grab a brush and put a little make up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes i had to stop my shower and pull the song up to confirm good rhythm to scrub to have no idea where the thought came from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this a joke about butt holes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont get it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and what made you assume that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,anus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an us anusbutthole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all about butt holes with you isnt it harley
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn you i was hoping for a chain of ass related puns edit assume
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think about buttholes penises and vaginas constantly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only have that one and its kind of shitty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you definitely could do butter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not even punny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought butt in butter would work out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is a pun in a way just not that punny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean yea if you wanna be anal about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lmao
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its pretty much shorthand for i cant understand it and thus i am uncomfortable for christians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont know why they are but they are cool ive seen a bunch of them devils mountain makes the least sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the concept of a devil doesnt exist without belief in god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,interesting theory devils bridge in sedona appears to defy the laymans understanding of basic physics you might be onto something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,devils backbone and devils bridge dont make much sense either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you think god would be mad that his creations are naming other creations after the devil
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure but theyre enemies so why not name everything gods backbone or gods bridge then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i drive on a hilltop road called devils backbone going between towns every once in a while
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would have to agree anywhere else you can put any forgotten thoughts into the middle of a paragraph or passage seamlessly ps you should omit the really in your statement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it can be used to say something thats a different context from the subject matter without looking random im paranoid also havent written a letter since before my teens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is true source i dont know what i look like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they can see themselves in reflective surfaces
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimirrortest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some but not all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as someone from canada who doesnt know the difference crocodilealligator d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bonus points if youre peeing in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why theyre one of the only countries that dosent get too pissed when you call them by an inaccurate name holland may only technically refer to a couple of regions in the nation of the netherlands but theyre perfectly willing to play along when someone calls the country that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in contrast greenland sounds like a nice place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like the netherlands is an appropriate synonym for ones crouch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meh ive seen plenty of limburgers groningers and especially friezen get annoyed by this term
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in reality though its really snowy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,iceland has plenty of ice but much less than greenland
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sugar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,milk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe they would double up aa annihilateapple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,android names their versions with numbers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nowadays it means the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not so much a shower thought than an observation that time is linear
Showerthoughts,not_removed,incorrect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that chess with a pigeon quote comes to mind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ha i just looked that up its beautiful lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are either going to get beat up or make person question life forever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah have fun with the cops
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yebrosame
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the bats flying out of cave are used to sweep tracks with their wings drone bats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its beautifulbut youre in a wrong reddit category
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you see this in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,busted i guess i broke the subreddit rules i did check it out on my iphone right before going in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its beautiful but youre in the wrong subreddit ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks youre thebest please fix this also
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks youre the best please fix this as well ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i prefer forced oral
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love that smell you get when you set your ex girlfriends house on fire all of the sour memories can go right up in flames and i can finally be truly free all it takes is a little lot of gasoline go on do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its more a metaphorical and philosophical statement than literal however people do say to others what they are too afraid to see in themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because its all yellow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that last bit threw me for a loop is it because i am angry and hurt inside
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most news is fake news now days you need to go to reuters or ap to get news
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tbh the only way to play it safe that your news is real is buzzfeed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but buzz feed is like mostly drunk people and sloths yes that video i trust the post the times npr and bbc best news sites and papers of all time for their reliability
Showerthoughts,not_removed,joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lmao my bad fam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure uber does that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,umthats what level support is the people who can actually do things for you hire a bunch of meatspace answering machines to deal with the faqs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes i agree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it wasnt your mind that came up with this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but my mind is conflicted about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your mind is oatmeal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is a good point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about jet packs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually time zones are really weird and complicated some time zones differ from their neighbors by only minutes others by minutes some places recognize daylight savings time while others do not india and china use a single time zone for their whole countries even though each should be spread over multiple zones at least for india and for china basically its not as simple as of the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you go by true solar time one tiny segment of the world is always at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a lot of math
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guilty my friend no longer trust my words a typical conversation goes like this dude you ready yeah man aiite omw shower now cunt aint nobody want to see you topless
Showerthoughts,not_removed,couldnt he poison him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kinda like blacklist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alfreds not related to the wayne family why would he inherit anything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he could but because of bruces age and fitness no one would ever believe he died of natural causes like the whole bruce lee conspiracy and of course the police would immediately suspect the only person close to him of possibly murdering him since of course alfred would have a motive billions of dollars however if a random villain killed bruce well alfred would be the new richest man in gotham
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ehhhh kinda its just hard to compare since megan boone couldnt out perform a dead possum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,living will and testament
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hed be more than a pennyworth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alfred doent need to inherit any money from bruce hes been embezzling from the family for years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hed be wayning in money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he wont have anymore dark knights
Showerthoughts,not_removed,truly a criminal mastermind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is water a snowflake is the ocean a snowflake i dont think you thought this one through
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in short were snowfalke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sowere only mostly waves of individuality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rshittyshowerthoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well some folks are special snowflakes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its shower thoughts what were you expecting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep and drinking water is cannabalism conversely since were not water eating or drinking anything thats not water is cannabalism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,arent all snowflakes special and unique
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i am to believe video games a medpack is pretty effective in keeping you alive longer and thus giving you time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tampons make up do also
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and underpants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was just gonna say that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that just means that its all downhill from here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that happened along time ago thanks for catching up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,top pranks that went too far
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or kinky i mean i wouldnt mind playing with my breasts as the first thing i do after waking up from a year coma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dear diary woke up today with a penis had to cut it off because i felt supressed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look at you being all witty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you mean qa testers even then qa testers arent climbing under buildings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how else are you supposed to say it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and washing hands in a public restroom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is so true and every time my wife loses at least in my head hehe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,glad its not only me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rrelationships be like you two are definitely not meant for eachother break up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guess you know which of you loves the other more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,got a text last night that literally read sometimes i think ill enjoy a night by myself then you leave and im like no come back haha from my wife
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your wife likes you but you dont like her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont understand why people require their partner to spend time with them every single day you cant skip a few a month or even per week yup guess thats why im single
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry to hear about your impending divorce
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont have a wife
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i get that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with kids any alone time is gold
Showerthoughts,not_removed,liking someone enjoying time to yourself are not mutually exclusive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i assumed it meant he liked to jerk off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only danger in my life is running out of lotion when the old ball and chain leaves for the weekend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure in their bones its just interlaced with more air their bones arent literally hollow open up a chicken
Showerthoughts,not_removed,safety deposit boxes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i get it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahahahahahaha good one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get this though birds never have to exhale they have a circular respiratory system unlike ours that dead ends they can inhale forever or at least until their last breath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if thats a terrible song and hot sauce just covers up sub par food no one knows because the tiny amount of difference in every thing to compare it to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the shittiest shitpost yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not even that why did he make it possible for them to dilate so much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,solid logic guys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the human arse hole is a poor design we have to wipe it every time we use it dogs arses cut the turd of perfectly with no need for toilet paper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you can go fuck yourself for thinking this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we also have penis sized turds so theres that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because if your so called god exist he is the shittiest designer in the entire world have you looked at the design for the human completely helpless for the first years of their life weak eyesight hearing and sense of smell just as they finally achieve enough experience and learning to be a productive member of society their body starts to break down seriously the human being is the worst intelligently designed thing on the face of the planet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the real question is why did he give us types of atypical sexgender differentiationand make it so common that for generations we had to dress up kill maim and mutilate our own children to appease
Showerthoughts,not_removed,poo doesnt have to come out of it or anything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dogs dont have huge butt cheeks like humans do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actuallyit does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,college educated are we
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well get at least two dramatic retellings of the earthquake tom hanks will star in at least one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ca is stuck by earthquakes on a near daily basis most of which are just too weak to feel what you mean is a major earthquake and if it were to destroy hollywood which isnt likely because ca has quite stringent earthquakeresistant building codesl movies wouldnt suck hollys wood movies would just be delayed id imagine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and a third one by syfy called sharkquake
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a black third grader goes to his mom and asks mom i have the biggest dick in the third grade is that because im black no leroy she responds its because youre nineteen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which is why those whats your best offensive joke threads are such a redundant circlejerk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i get it has anyone recently lost a loved one in preferably tragic circumstances
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how long does it take for a black woman to take a shit months
Showerthoughts,not_removed,finding humour in something horrible is a way to cope and disconnect from what is happening it is morrbid but it helps people working with death and illness fo it a lot so there is a time and place but often it is quite inappropriate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is no such thing as too soon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kind of like how the best puns are the worst puns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if its not too soon its already too late
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yall motherfuckers need to follow jeselnik on twitter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whyd the girl scout want because it aint no girl scout
Showerthoughts,not_removed,needs blacker name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,his name was harambe he was taken to soon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,geezus fucking hell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a better way to put it than just telling my friends and family that im a psychopath i was talking to a coworker the other day and he said he ran over a cat the night before when he realized what had happened he started crying when he stopped at an intersection shortly after he was obviously tore up about it but i absolutely could not stop myself from laughing when he told me too many things go through my head i think im desensitized to roadkill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,needs more relevant fraction edit and leroy is totally a stereotypical black name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok you might actually be mentally disturbed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a criticism within a criticism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive been called worse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id rather be fucked by a sex animal than by a doctor but to each his own
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats like saying youd rather learn math from a savant then from a math professor most muscle bound guys are genetically predisposed to be muscular regardless of how much they eat or workout so the guy with the degree would probably give you much better and precise advice which is more applicable to your body type he just happens to choose to be skinny for whatever reason maybe longer youth who knows
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have been trained by both the skinny man with the degree was much better i never had an injury and reached my goals a lot faster as i didnt over train or end up eating too much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats nice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or your charger the panic would set in when you hit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,time outs for small children not children old enough to be concerned about wifi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,indeed and perhaphs teach a degree of moderation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plot twist it was lead paint and ops parents just wanted to be rid of their little wifi hogging mistake
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i recall being around and fully aware of what a power cord to a snes was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even better is when they try the door knock then ask anyone in there just so you get to awkwardly yell back yup then theres always the weird eye contact with the person waiting there as you leave and your only thought is hope he enjoys the smell of my shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha yup
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have fun smelling my poopsss bitchessss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,call me parochial but i figured it was just because theyre a bunch of whiny cunts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at least im not the only one who thinks this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,u shud post a pic and let others decide
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but can you see your junk now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but led to some even more uncomfortable talks about browser history
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i kept seeing tv shows that mention the talk and dreaded when my turn would come
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that moment when you tell your parents what a charizard is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,text message is the new doorbell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what i cant wait to give my son the talk i figure is a ripe age to know maybe a bit younger kids have so much more info now than i did at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean they do have sponsored results which is basically the same thing without making people feel like theyre being advertised to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do have ads if you search something like amazon for example one of the results might have a little ad thing before the url all the ads are the first to show up they might not be the classic banner ads but they are still ads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about the first results of almost any google search are ads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shower thought youre a fucking idiot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why theyre successful because youre being advertised to without knowing search for something generic like car or insurance and see what i mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought we were the adds because of the free data we provide they dont sell the meta data
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im talking about sidebar ads pop ups clutter etc the sponsored ads still get you to the place you need to be i wouldnt compare the two
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes ads pop up on the right hand side have you ever used google before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youd have some momentum so youd actually oscillate back and forth across the center for some time eventually yes youd end up at the center edit youd also be disintegrated from the vast pressure and heat but thats k
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youd die from immense heat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you drilled a hole into the earths magma then it wouldnt really remain a hole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gravity to the left of me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mmmm that creamy molten centre
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jokers to the right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill stick with the palace itd have plumbing and stuff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,caves are nice i like caves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably agree tbh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey depends on the cave it might have moss hanging from it and such there are some legitimately beautiful caves best of both worlds would be living officially in the palace but with stuff set up in the cave so you could run off and avoid people bonus points if you can get wifi from the palace
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay see this palace everyone in it is at my command check this out butler chef theme song guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats with caves these days huh on the inside they are dark and cold but on the outside they look like rocks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like the way think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wut
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if he didnt have big hair hed look like a mob hit man or a high school football coach
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that didnt answer the question still just a mass of hair hats and nose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know man although hes funny from time to time i dont like how conan went to someone their house and kept insulting him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea because the word sometimes was invented jackass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because we generally dont want a picture of ourselves scowling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do we all i see are asses and tits and duckfaces on ig
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cuz we want to portray ourselves as perfect and happy and wonderful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not enough places do this though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mmmmouth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pussy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im going to be that guy the moon is a satellite not a planet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to touch another celestial body you mean the moon is not a planet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes he will be remembered as the most important explorer in history or at least the most groundbreaking one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,butwe dont remember the first people who touched continents or swam in oceans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the moon is a wheel of cheese dingus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have always thought this my penis is probably a lot cleaner than all the fucking doorknobs and shit i touch througout the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do wash my hands before and after pee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,simple answer no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let it spider
Showerthoughts,not_removed,studying science has the opposite effect on me but human institutions i agree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i use books for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly what i was going to say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agree im not about to do an extra reps because the goo goo dolls iris is blasting over the speakers i always pack my headphones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but if you forget headphones it is nice to know at least there will be some music to work out to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats this gym you speak of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate working out with headphones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and sometimes they play guilty pleasure music that youll never admit to liking now you have to resist the urge to bop your head or lipsynch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey that is great song
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont get me wrong its a classic but its not doing anyone favours inside the gym
Showerthoughts,not_removed,prolly dozens of ppl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or tv shows
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just dont watch it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,check out stitcher you have a variety of podcasts to listen to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about listening to some podcasts you can search for documentaries and talks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is non music person code for robot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait wait wait wait non music person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i will check them out was looking for things like famous dialogs from movies for example all the debates from the great debaters final speech by al pacino on scent of a woman opening scene of the newsroom chaplin speech on the great dictator etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guilty as charged
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you or someone you know is trying to quit drinking i hope they stick with it and wish them luck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can relate to this almost years sober and still get a little thirsty when those commercials come onespecially during football season it does get easier as you get more time under your belt hang in there it is worth it and will be source of great pride and accomplishment you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank a lot i know quite a few people trying to quit but even old timers say thirty years clean or so fall off the wagon and go on crazy bingers i hate alcohol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks really appreciate your positive words
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sponges are just mops for water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,water is just wet for mops
Showerthoughts,not_removed,very high earth creatures have adapted to almost every terrain able to sustain life in all shapes and sizes odds are planets out there arent that much different from earth terrain and will resemble our creatures in some way or another
Showerthoughts,not_removed,very very likely convergent evolution is seen presently and in the past
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look at arthropods they have looked like that for ish million years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,none we are it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,check out the origins of the venus fly trap intriguing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that makes sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can you explain your math
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but they were on a break
Showerthoughts,not_removed,immediately after discovering they were made of methane
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except water and sand jeans feel fucking awful if they are wet and sandy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jeans definitely dont go well in formal situations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cocaine doesnt really mix well with these either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i guess the same could be said for coke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what research is this statement based on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should be thanking peter dinklage who is an actual person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably the ceiling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most likely close the walls and corners how often do you walk near the floorboards or step in the corners
Showerthoughts,not_removed,until just now i didnt know repost is short for regurgitated shitpost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except its not httpsenmwikipediaorgwikislang
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpwwwdictionarycombrowseslang
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i remember seeing this posted on tumblr and on the same thread someone reasoned that paper beats rock because paper represents knowledge youre both wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just dont tell people youre slanging or the police might be asking you uncomfortable questions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it isnt

Showerthoughts,not_removed,you made me feel like a repulsive human
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont put your pizza in the fridge when your done eating it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pizza tastes good even if it stayed out of the fridge all night i ve done it so many times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,box keeps the freshness flies away so its okay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you leave pizza out all night and eat it in the morning thats fucking gross
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we are scum

Showerthoughts,not_removed,fact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget pepperoni is salt with a little bit of pork in it

Showerthoughts,not_removed,not sure that would stop most of us anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude quit with the if god didnt want sex questions we got through those in middle school

Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm ill be afk for a sec
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they thought they were gonna die and they got a little prfft in their pants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never trust a fart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,according to doglaw his pee must have touched the lunar surface for the claim to be substantiated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,surely itd be the last to pee on it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mmm i dunnoif a dog were wearing a nappy when it cocked its leg the tree wouldnt be his so still very cool that urination has occurred on the moon lunaration
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first lunar color pencil
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it really depends on if the pee has to be in liquid form they concerted their urine into deionized water drinking water and left behind the solid crystalized waste also even that may not have ever directly touched the surface the more fun fact i like to remind people of is that there is poop on the moon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good to know you dont think i exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that seems fair
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til australians like basketball
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do you think about my city i wonder san antonio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,poor indiana
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe we actually have the second highest number of league passes in the world behind the us obviously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,san antonio wasnt really what i was thinking about when i posted this it was philadelphia brooklyn sacramento and phoenix must be absolute shit holes boston is a great brilliant city and san francisco is a cashed up city
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just like your last resort friend who saves you from killing someone or yourself lmao 😂 and yet they steal stuff from you and fuck you over
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gonna quote cheryl tunt heredo you think thats wiiiiissssse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like any of us little people will be able to afford cancer treatments in about ten years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah yes i was walking into work one day when i walked passed someone that someone had a scent so amazing my penis took notice and crawled out of my pants just to get a whiff it proceeded to drag me over to them and rubbed its self all over them to get the scent on its self to this very day my penis still has the smell on it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to get on this girl when i was younger and as girls do she had a specific of jumper of mine she always wore when i moved i kept that jumper purely because of how fucking good she made it smell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because you cant close a candle but you can close a book when youre done smelling it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must not buy candles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why dont they have a new candle scent candle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first time attempting to add link insert googled new book candle youre welcome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because not everyone is a nerd like you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there was this dude in the east village that sold incense that smelled likeasshole wet pussy stinky pussy feet armpit and so many more it was god awful passing by
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes i often make decisions based on which option i think i will regret the least later on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not normal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you need to roll the dice give yourself options roll it and do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok debbie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,should have taken the red pill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the costanza approach
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but then id be left lamenting the fact that i didnt take the blue pill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,interesting im a seinfeld fan but i must have missed this episode got something to search for now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you got me their lol fuck it take them both candy flip
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive found that usually when someone else is calling someone a pussy they are really saying something more like you havent made the same decision as me and so must think you are smarter than me youre not smarter than me i am stronger than you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,better they dont procreate we dont need more shitheads who dont shut up cause they werent brought up properly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like a damn good reason to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess this is the internet in a nutshell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must have shitty friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just stopped hanging out with people that only want to smoke weed boring friends if you ask me nothing against pot but if your only idea of a good time is to smoke a bowl im gonna find someone else to hang out with
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree entirely i was always a smoke on the go kind of person or smoke and then go couch surfing never suited me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op clearly has never experienced the joy of months of pregnant sex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op is the girl no one really was friends with they just tolerated her because she brought the weed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a friend with weed is a friend indeed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who buries the forgotten no one because no one is there to remember
Showerthoughts,not_removed,killer robot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the wind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,none of your business
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mother earth no less
Showerthoughts,not_removed,time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,brings a whole new meaning to digging your own grave
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and water dust and time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve been reading up on hollow moon huh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe just the first one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope saw a painting in mrrobot of a moon in that evil lawyer lady with the pacemakers house and thats when it hit me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also is we cut out the dark ages
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well the reason we did get some much sleep and now its becoming a problem is light up until relatively recently when the sun set thats all the daylight cant plow shit at night may as well take a nappy poo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tfw persian sumerian and assyrian history is asian history
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why we tend to learn a somewhat decent amount of western history in school but eastern history is largely ignored even though its just as rich
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is silly asian history is one of the oldest and most interesting cultures in the world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck im a nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think everyone who likes history is a nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i should add if you hadnt guessed from my name that ive actually lived in tokyo while studying design had internships lots of cool stuff lots of bad stuff but one thing that struck me is that i always felt talking about my experiences there were a very nerdy topic yet if a japanese person wanted to talk about their experiences living in say europe and their fascination with that culture i would consider that perfectly normal so while having a poop this morning this is more of a toiletthought than a showerthought sorry i thought wait that doesnt make sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so when america is self centered and only cares about themselves you call them stupid but when they actually do want to learn about the rest of the world you call them nerds ffs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some asian history is actually very interesting especially with how japan became so powerful so quickly from being stuck in the middle ages in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is so americacentric it hurts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why i was just thinking how asia had a rich culture and history im not westerner nor asian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in ancient china they would have believed similar things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about asian interested in asian history
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i actually think everyone interested in any history has to be a nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,implying that samurai arent cool motherfuckers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think asian culture like chinese korean and japanese are super interesting because they are countries that are in the same development as the country i live in usa but have a completely different culture and how it got to where it is today i find that super interesting and dont know why people think im a losernerdweaboo for learning chinesekoreanjapanese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,being asian and still bring born in the western nations is also a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats pretty stupid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this makes absolutely no sense why do you think that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is an ignorant post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what a broad open mind you have huh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats only if you grew up in the west though and thats because you learn the history of your own country and people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would argue that eastern history is even more rich than western
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no its fucking shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would write a lengthy retort on why youre so wrong but i have to get back to reading the twelve caesars by suetonius
Showerthoughts,not_removed,says the man with an ultranerdy ratchet and clank name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what was some of the good and bad stuff i am interested in living in japan for more reasons than anime and hentai
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no we dont call them nerds their own countrymen do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah no dutch actually gave em good knowledge waaaay before that since early
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but im from denmark
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean like the rest of reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how is this true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what are you i just about everything is west of asia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then clearly this doesnt apply to you lol this is about westerners
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you either study the blade with your waifu and think anime is the best art form ever or you actually are a history buff its usually the former with westerners
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have world history classes but what that really meant was europe and the americas i felt cheated i think the extent of my asian knowledge after high school was gunpowder came from there i picked up europa universalis iv and tried playing japan for a few games and it struck me that i had no idea that of those countries and kingdoms ever existed and that was only years ago it felt like i was playing on a randomly generated map or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im gonna stuff you in a locker nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,strange op is from tokyo and denmark and is calling us nerds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because the shower thought is based on the premise that the world revolves around the west
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i live in washington and to me asia is to the west a flight to japan would go over the pacific ocean from here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,australia is on average at the same longitude as japan perth is west of japan sydney is east of japan ie it is just as eastern as japan australia is not an asian country
Showerthoughts,not_removed,antarctican
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a westerner and dont see makes studying the han dynasty any better or worse than the flavian dynasty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair id be more inclined to study kublai khan if he looked like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i suppose this is a stereotype i love anime as an art form i love anime like mushishi and spiritual ones my cousin wanted to get me a body pillow for my birthday but im so glad he did not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good more time for me to read suetonius ha i win again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you realize europe was the original western world right talk about not knowing your history holy shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so youre dumping in europe in as part of america what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,time for a lesson on geography terminology when saying west and east in terms of parts of the world we speak in terms of the mercator protection of the earth with north and south america in the west and europe and asia in the east even if we were speaking just the us washington is still in the west so unless washington is full of hipsters that use backwards maps youre western
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many people studying the flavian dynasty walk around wearing sandals and olive branch crowns calling each other augustus now how many people studying japanese do you see walking around with anime shit all over them playing with katanas and calling each other san and chan and shit see the difference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,puts lock on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,making it doubly true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both are considered west its even more ethnocentric to look at the west as just the us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt say im not western im just saying that i dont look east to asia its so much closer to the west i think its more than geography terminology i think people just put up an imaginary wall at the pacific ocean in their minds i mean yeah its a big ocean but its easy to forget some times that alaska is just a short hop from russia unless youre sarah palin also fuck the mercator projection
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are kinda judging a loose group of people based on their most extreme examples its kinda like saying everyone who likes tv is a nerd because of cosplayers i personally know a lot of people who are interested in asian culture but i have never seen the extreme you are talking about outside of internet posts from strangers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many people studying the flavian dynasty walk around wearing sandals and olive branch crowns calling each other augustus zero because triumphant romans didnt wear olive branch crownsthey wore laurel wreaths made of bay laurel checkmate plebian s now how many people studying japanese do you see walking around with anime shit all over them playing with katanas and calling each other san and chan and shit in high school and community college a handful to be fair though if the roman empire was still a thing exporting its culture all around the world there probably would be romanophiles speaking to each other in latin play gladiator fighting and seasoning their foods with httpsenwikipediaorgwikigarum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because theyre the extreme weebs i only call them weebs because they take it too far and are considered extreme a minority they care about anime manga etc and want to act like the japanese portrayed in anime not real japanese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pulls out volume of gibbons the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how is this america centric because it references the west the west doesnt refer to america well then its extra true wat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes im european and this post may be westcentric but its certainly not americacentric
Showerthoughts,not_removed,about the youre western part i thought you were the one above who said that he wasnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til also where can i get one of those sweet crowns and some sandals lets do this shit up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact shes sixteen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,touché
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its ethnocentric to think interest in asian history is nerdy and the same in western history is normal its even more ethnocentric to assume the west is just the us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shes actually iirc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lpt take lpts with a grain of salt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats called reading
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never watched the show but based off theme opening i have to agree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fate is what outside influences have determined to be your future destiny is how you choose to change your future maybe they were fated to die too soon and making a cure could have been their destiny they had done differently maybe they were fated to be the cure maker but wove their own destiny by driving drunk and going off that bridge lesson two fourteen reasons to never time travel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they probably died of cancer too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doctors dont cure people they treat peopletheres a bunch of scientists in labs trying to find cureits better to prevent it than treat it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see the robots are trying to make me feel think they have free will
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see the robots are trying to make me think im a robot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtotallynotrobots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or where the fuck did i place my phone again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,give them another ten years to catalog and cross reference everything you have ever mentioned in an email or google chat and this will probably become reality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have obviously never seen black mirror
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could if you fucking used google like we wanted you to bitch your friends at google
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this sounds terrifying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i read that second memory incorrectly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the nsa would wish that too for everyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what kind of movies did he take you to billy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never actually get it with uncles and kids 😁
Showerthoughts,not_removed,however if you have a flight coming up and you cant find the fucking email you can google when is my flight and there is your itinerary i know its rather late but i found this out yesterday and i am impressed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,movies my uncle took of me as a child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as long as other people cant see sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,home video son
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this reminds me of the short film httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzonrckuffw but with less feels
Showerthoughts,not_removed,back in the day these were called pictures but after the digital age was born nobody bothered to print any photos nor did anyone noticed the value and importance of such
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who else did your uncle take as a child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like this is one of those wishes you ask of a mischievous genie who gives you everything you want only everyone else can google your life too and every detail of your life is on the internet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why parents need to start blogs for their kids at conception
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet your mom would be the best for this job not google she even knows where your lost things are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,always wanted something like this life statistics lets you recall everything youve done down to the smallest detail like how many times youve walked down a street or times youve had a drink however it would be an ethical grey area with private information and advertising etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive heard of parents making email accounts for their kids so they can email childhood memories directly to an email made for the kid and they can have access to it when they are or but email didnt exist when most of us were born damn scrape booking must suck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,watch the season episode of black mirror
Showerthoughts,not_removed,keep a journal or blog and you can future you will really enjoy it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you couldnt do that though because youd have too many weirdos wackin it to their parents banging or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or days i didnt jerk off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in another few years kids will use facebook for exactly this purpose and the elderly could use it when their memory starts failing them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if this existed someone might do it and then acsess some weird shit they forgot about and no this sounds like a dangerous idea interesting though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure thats coming soon with ok google perhaps ask siri or alexa for now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this will probably be a thing one day not even joking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,try google map timelines i always go back when i forget what i did one day kinda creepy that it follows me but it works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is exactly the reason i started journalling a week ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you would search dad and come up with no results
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was super tired one morning and couldnt find the remote i watch tv first thing in the morning and googled where is the remote it took me a solid minutes to realize what i had done
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean you could get that but then you complain about your privacy and why dont you even leave me alone while im in the bathroom and we cant just work that way sincerely your google overlords
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean you could get that but then you complain about your privacy and why dont you even leave me alone while im in the bathroom and we cant just work that way sincerely your google overlords
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this guy lives with a computer attached to him so he can do exactly that amazing story and some benefits i didnt foresee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can tell you what movies you went to with your uncle as a child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,watch black mirrors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can google where you parked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha so my year old son brought home a small project my sons school is celebrating veterans day by asking if any students have veterans in their families and then providing their names and info on this piece of paper that they will hang in their hallway at school the info that we needed to provide was name military branch and years of service so i wrote down his great grandpas name and military branch he was in the navy during wwii but i didnt know how long he served my year old son then told me that i should ask google i couldnt help but laugh i ended up texting great grandpa and he enlisted near the end of the war and served for years and yes my year old grandpa can text and facebook its great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,soontm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it exists its called facebook
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called a diary or a journal start one now not that i have either but then again its not my wish having said that theres a lot of things i wish i had written down somewhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,join the nsa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel as though this will become a thing as facebook and other popular social media sites exist i can already look back and wonder what was that restaurant i went to this time last year or what was that girls name from that event
Showerthoughts,not_removed,times corrected by grammar nazis to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the first porn i ever watched the first time i got hard really you want to google your own life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you mean times my uncle touched me as a child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but googles on my phone though and i probably wouldnt have bothered to sync my computer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre using android and have android device manager installed you can google find my phone it will locate it using gps and can send a command to make ring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were not even on rlifeprotips but it still remains true that the real life pro tip is always in the comments
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure you can do that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i honestly think this is something that may happen sometime soon given all the data google is storing from us in a regular basis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have google photos installed on my phone and desktop i can search for my kids and it will show all the pictures they are in or pictures of dogs and it will show all the photos i have of my dog very cook and very creepy at the same time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,already has all this info if you and uncle have android so the query is easy when uncle joe and you went to a place that was at that time a cinema what was showing at that time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its kinda scary when you think about it people looking you up and knowing everything you do in your life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the entire history of you is exactly what i thought of its also scarily plausible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people didnt know it at the time but google is really what everyone needed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my uncle took me as a child
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relevant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also relevant httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzonrckuffw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant remember i was trying to remember but couldnt i know signs was one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,movies about gladiators
Showerthoughts,not_removed,literally my first thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,check out the entire history of you from black mirror
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the kind of magic google can do i say screw privacy that shit is convienient
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my friends have been posting statues on facebook when their kids reach milestones years from now they will know the day rowan started eating solid food i think its going to be interesting when these kids are on social media themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre not curious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you severely underestimate my laziness nakedpantsu
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know lol a lot of people in this thread have told me so p i guess i was wrong haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a cliché but thats way more advanced than anything in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank goodness im not in school anymore how fucking creepy is that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get diarrhea one day security comes to check if youre doing drugs in the bathroom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,second episode of the first season still bothers me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh god signs to what billy signs to what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you ever been inside a turkish prison
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if my computed gets hacked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,android watch with android device manager is probably as easy as you can get
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can also google where you parked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,has hitler in username makes comparison to a book about abusive control of population seems like life pattern is continuing as expected no identity theft detected
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and everyones a racist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as an artist you should know that art is subjective
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meteorites are unusual rocks and theyre zero evidence of aliens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,am for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as soon as the sun rises and i hear the seagulls outisde
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i say between like and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it has to do with when the romans kept time it was the halfway point between sunset and sunrise this varied seasonally
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are incorrect midnight is the beginning of the day am is still very early in the day midnight would actually be around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we can percieve the dimension and every dimension below us and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,watch this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,technically we cant see but we can perceive the fourth dimension as time the difference between yesterday and today can be thought of as a distance in the fourth dimension
Showerthoughts,not_removed,carl sagan is the bees knees
Showerthoughts,not_removed,were talking spatial dimensions here ever seen a tesseract aka a hypercube
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i consider time to be a spatial dimension in the following way consider dropping a rock from the top of a cliff to the bottom it has moved in space from one location to another and is demonstrably in a different location now consider your car right now it may be in your driveway at home but at midday its in the parking lot at work it has demonstrably moved in the dimension of time from one location to another in the same way the rock moved in and for the duration of its fall space check this one out minutes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or curious george knows how to speak english
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you seen the cartoon though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because its never used in any other context
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why not give it a try again trees welcome all creatures to rest on their branches
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think i now know what im doing tomorrow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if hes asian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh wow that is super original i wonder if anyone will remember a time before computers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey buddy where is this rage coming from why are you attacking this poor fool he isnt worth your time ulizardkingrebirth go make some tea or something and let this idiot go in peace
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do they give you a discount on the trolltoll if you have a vip membership
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no mr lizard king that is what your voice makes it sound like when you read the comment i wrote or its just your subconscious thought kicking in again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone has to tell people when their thoughts are stupid and unoriginal just now that someone was me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with a name like ucorkscrewduckpenis id take his advice ulizardkingrebirth that man knows a thing or two about letting things go and moving on with your life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it sounds like youre saying boys hole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it sounds like you have to pay the troll toll if you want to get this boys hole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im picking up what youre putting down here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not sure you know what the hell youre talking about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,legally if you are up for a certain amount of hours and driving you can be charged similarly to someone who is drunk and driving do you know what youre talking about about whether or not op knows what theyre talking about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you missed the word benefits is there any
Showerthoughts,not_removed,delusions without drugs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish it wasnt true but if i reach a streak i wanna push to see how long i can go my sister has like or people over days i made it to once and lost it didnt go back for a few days starting again and cant stop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not a towel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they only work if the person on them sticks to said diet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,churdum breh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes this alcohol consumption also tends to drop right off people vastly underestimate the calories in alcohol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they have games that do it for them you know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so true lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you are able to afford a thousand dollar purchase then it is hilarious that you complain about fifty cents
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre missing the point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre making a thousand dollar purchase maybe consider bringing a bag to carry it home rather than putting it in a cheap fifty cent bag
Showerthoughts,not_removed,perfectly said its about getting people to not use single use bags in the first place i live in california and we charge ¢ and people flip their shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how can i move there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shit people thought jesus was crazy and that was in a time where it was acceptable to cut off someones hand that stole from you maybe hes already came back as like hugh jackman but just decided he didnt want all the fucking attention this time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely even in jesus time he was accused of blasphemy to sum it up no prophet is accepted in his own land
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if a god sent a messenger that failed to relay a message shouldnt that god have known how to not fail at sending a message
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i once for a short film i swear covered myself in mustard and wandered down the streets of seattle shouting things like you all think i think you cant hear me but you can and i dont and you must repent for your sins right now the end of days is upon all of us people didnt even give me a wide berth they just walked past and continued their day like normal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was the savior for a while but no one believed me so i was fired
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but she was found what about all the others still hiding
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but for head phone just the chip
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wireless headphones already exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know but i mean a converter that can make wired headphones wireless
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bluetooth adapters do exist just go on amazon and look for one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rules no shower observations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean masturbated to dont you it okay we are all assuming that is what you meant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you were kidnapped by foreign agents and they took samples of your dna and then returned you its possible that a clone of you could end up running their country and becoming the best leader ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think so usually when i see that it makes me happy theyre looking at something that makes the smile and feel good whats not to like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i disagree if i see someone reading something funny on their phone i assume they have friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe for you i go to sleep at about and wake up at about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that sounds like a dream i wake up at get down to by pm and then my iphone from hell is well below as i leave work and sometimes i can get home in time to plug it in again before it dies not great but yes i dig your general idea although i supposed maybe my iphone battery is in sync with my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i fully charge my phone before i go to bed so the alarm on my phone can wake me up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true but unfortunately i dont get a recharge nap like my phone requires every day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please dont move to austin were full enough already theres plenty of other great cities that would be delighted to have you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually they would not wear any make up at all they wouldnt be allowed to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well the one on the trainstation i just saw definetly had some makeup on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmm then i dont know my guess is good as yours sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course its possible if you can live there theres no reason you couldnt reproduce assuming that the parents are properly protected from radiation exposure mars one httpwwwmarsonecomfaqhealthandethicshowmuchradiationwillthesettlersbeexposedto they seem confident but if something goes wrong youll see it in the kids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would reproduction be possible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably would guess we should send pregger ladies to the space station now and see if there baby survives the birthing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course its possible human reproduction is possible anywhere people can have sex and if people can build survivable shelters then theyre gonna be able to have sex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol wtf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow hit me like a ton of bricks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i were a porn star id constantly be filing sexual harassment claims with hr just to fuck with em
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for some reason i feel like its contract work like each movie is is own little llc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there has to be a union to complain to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that must be one funny union
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont want no philanthropist living near me or ma kids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you are rich enough it is a job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions see also the fundamental attribution error
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we wouldnt react wed be squished
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why you be bugging i would say sleepily
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont think too hard about capitalism the conclusion you reach is eerily similar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is dumb and you should feel bad about posting it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are shit at not being shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,spawn traps all day youve been warned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relevant username for said post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or just say gday and be done with it 😄
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can say its a good night goodnight is only one word as a goodbye
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that sounds cute
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can refill an empty bottle whether the contents are fit for consumption is a different story
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there was a writin prompt a couple of days back that had this as a story commented was really well written and pretty dope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually thats pretty much how things really are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,delete your account bro 😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stupid af
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretending not to believe no its for reals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre a theist in name only you say you believe in god but you only go to church because your family forces you you dont care enough about concepts like god the soul or selftranscendence to think critically about them there is something wrong with saying you believe in x and not acting like you do id be worried btw this was me judging you without knowing you if you think thats unfair you ought not post garbage like this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are so wrong its not funny i am an aethist i do not believe in god it has nothing to do with church it has everything to do with the fact that i think the whole notion of god itself is stupid i wont critise your beliefs i wont call you stupid i wont call you ignorant so please do not insult me by calling me lazy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah thats all it was all along you got us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you think everyone actually agrees with you and are just bad humans and hiding it wow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no posts of this calibre are derogatory to any faith i may have had in short my firm atheism is all your fault
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant comprehend anyones life experience more than superficially differing from my own
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they call people too lazy to go to church nonpracticing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,going to church is just being too lazy to be your own person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lmaooooo tru
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its always been baseball for me i hate that boring sport
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but if the dead fly is dead the it cannot reproduce oh but then were leaving the fast flies mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can swat the super flies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why do people think there has to be a point to life there is not or it is whatever you make yourself you just came into existence but you will die aswell progress is a lie because the universe is a infinite circle of big bangs and heat deaths this means that every decision you can make has already been made in the past and will be made in the future you are simply alive to work as a observer of the universe because if there is no observer there is no universe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just came here to write the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,windows has no solutions ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at least u can figure it out with some nerd skills on mac theres no such thing cuz ur probably a businessman who blew on his computer and aint got time for dat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes macs are easy the solution is always the same buy a new mac
Showerthoughts,not_removed,money trees would be the true cash crop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take your upvote and get outta here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so if you masturbate but you dont want to it can be considered rape
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sex is not limited to penetrationintercourse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes i am ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes your hand just makes its way down there without you even realizing unconsensual sexrape
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you also never experience childbirth or period cramps so look on the bright side
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a man i will never truly know what a cactus feels
Showerthoughts,not_removed,orgy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but your dignity is still intact yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eyy bb i have and a large pepperoni pizza
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you didnt go down on her first youre a shitty guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is your name duece bigalow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mad corny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so whats the issue here she couldnt have been that bad since you set a pretty low payment standard and you walked away fed paid and laid sounds like an all around win to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey twenty bucks is twenty bucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in scotland its considered good luck for a black cat to cross your path so conflicted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone just bought a shitload of fireworks didnt they
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont get it why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fireworks are big the light up a night sky id guess something large like fireworks would be more grandiose large groups could see it at the same time a cellphone screen is pitiful next to that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i guess i get what youre saying thats pretty far back in time though youre speaking of like stone age people right id bring fire arms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,firearms would convince a small few whove seen what it can do as a show of power fireworks would make them think you are a god that controls the sky
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea but what if they call your bluff theres always been skeptics and people who dont believe in gods
Showerthoughts,not_removed,giant flaming explosions going on in the sky show me your non believers then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just takes one bratty kid to be like fuck that guy i dont believe him he doesnt have to think it through but if he doesnt anything then itll be like the end of the wizard of oz except more bloody why not a giant gun with flare rounds you can light up the sky with that or a flame thrower draconys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit did you just see that the explosion in the sky with fire and light and what were you saying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but then how would you make it known that you were the one doing it wouldnt they be like oh wow this guys weird forget about him look how pretty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,born in already plenty of things that make me feel old i dont need one more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holla
Showerthoughts,not_removed,five more years and we will be old
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre a deep thinker
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you would prefer subtitles that is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,animals use twitter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well they obviously use google translate before posting on twitter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think thats a lot of peoples wish for a way to go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the best way to go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i want to be fully aware of my impending death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is it because you dont want it to be suddenly over you want a chance to say goodbye
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for sure i rather it be spontaneous when i least expect it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly you just go to sleep one day and you never wake up again nobody got the chance to say goodbye last words or do whatever they were gonna do because you suddenly dissapeared thats what im afraid of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt want to say goodbye to everybody and i wouldnt want to know that im dying it would just add sadness and stress and if you know youre dying you are probably not feeling good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this really is a good idea prepare to be assassinated and your idea stolen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but if i forgot the things i dont want to remember do i still win
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have to remember a portion of something to know you forgot the whole thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt they be smart enough to keep themselves from destroying themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they elected trump as president
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heard about this a while back in a podcast the basic theory is that all intelligent species will eventually build something that will destroy themselves much like nuclear weapons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe they found out that the most optimal way of living is not living at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but dont all those cynics that i at least see a lot of on reddit say were not an intelligent species if were not an intelligent species we would therefore never build what ends up destroying us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but not living wouldnt be living at all therefore it cant be the most optimal way of living
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell me where you live and ill make it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill be there to make
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i live in chicago soprobably at least
Showerthoughts,not_removed,check for monster mutant its marketed as a super soda
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called an energy drink
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right there with you monster is super tasty but the heart cancer is sucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,brazil is the chinaindia of the southern hemisphere greenland is the antarctica of the northern hemisphere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,new zealand is australias canada but australia is basically southern hemisphere canada so the analogy is confusing source canadian expat in aus have discussed matter with aussies and kiwis all agree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most aussiescanadians say its canada its culturally nearly identical
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because we like canada
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and we like you canadian expat in melbs here theyre basically the same country
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it really is though source i also live here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i kinda do the same thing instead of reddit i check twitter or facebook while im dating my hand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heathen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive slept with women and im still a dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait is knowing things the only qualifications you need to run a library is it even one of the qualifications
Showerthoughts,not_removed,currently sitting at my job in a library pondering what the hell that sentence is supposed to mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey thats my technique for when i actually want to get things done but only sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reverse psychology procrastination motivation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,precisely dr leary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess you dont use pens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people that smoke use it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or a phone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean they literally dont do anything and still making money for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i literally help socially isolated seniors come back to society through different programs that are offered through the agency i work in dont get me wrong i dont hate the kardashians for mastering social media i just dont think theyre actually contributing in a meaningful way with all their millions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a difference between throwing money at something and actually going out and doing something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course it is i understand what youre saying but the people involved day to day and advocating are much more impactful than the money being donated youre equating money actually caring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i was younger i looked in the newspaper now that im older i dont bother with newspapers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ms word and most office docs now save to onedrive and autosave also with file history turned on it would have been copied to a seconary source i think you would have been fine with word
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think they stick to the bottom of leaves or something to be in the shade
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same with cats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i pop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ancient cat memesi like it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,has anyone ever noticed the influence that cats have on the human mind why would we willingly let cats control our state of mind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what happened is some pharaoh loved cats and hated that people were using them for meat so much that he thought to himself ill tell people to worship the cat and then they cant kill the cat source a place person or thing from which something comes or can be obtained
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably based on the amount of time money effort and care we spend on cats future people will probably assume we worship cats too we sorta do though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,toxoplasmosis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like my ex girlfriend mixed with an oriental background actress
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikitoxoplasmosis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikitoxoplasmosis helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow of all humans are infected
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uh what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meds theyre not just for breakfast anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,almost as bad as all the soapboxing on raskreddit yeah ive had to apply so many filters to both subreddits just so i dont have to deal with that crap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well to be fair it also has problems with rules and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,click edit page copy contents to word processor findandreplace utility is to was copy contents back to edit page submit takes a couple of minutes at most assuming you dont mess up the formatting in the transfer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,arent most bios typically written in past tense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,truly the unsung victims of these tragedies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it wouldnt surprise me if in a lot of cases they have a version ready to go in the event of a persons death newspapers for example have obituaries prewritten for those who have a decent probability of passing away a case in point is nelson mandela i know that a major newspapers had his obit on hand and ready to go in the event of his death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure its just automatically done by a bot nowadays
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was born in i cant see it any other way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this needs to be a subreddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rducksonhardwoodfloors content would be scarce though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are looking within yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,being a lefty you have no real choice but to be semi ambidextrous as of things you use in life are made right handed it sucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,keeps you on your toes but they just might happen to be on the wrong side
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only so i could not get ink on my hand yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey vsauce michael here can blind people suffer from arachnophobia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,close your eyes and let some spiders crawl on you its probably even worse since they cant see it coming
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine if you were blind and got tactile bug hallucinations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine a spider crawling across your face and not being able to see if its gone or waiting for round two sorry for the nightmare fuel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in hours of video were uploaded per minute and that statistic has only grown since then that means you couldnt watch all of youtube because there will be even more youtube by the time you finish watching youtube
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah i think youd get caught in a loop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy fuck that blows my mind to think about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre a witch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what httphothardwarecomnewshowtoholdaphonenokia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,best thing ever if i had the money id gild this comment yeah motherfucker like you didnt spend on some other stupid bullshit today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think the barrier is often people not wanting to link their credit card to a bunch of websites but absolutely when i first got a smartphone and scoffed at buying some apps a friend said to me youll pay bucks at the store for a bag of chips do you think that cent app will be at least as satisfying as a bag of chips fast forward a few years and the steam winter sale
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you reply and the rest of the day to you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the proper reply
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well kept answering the same question for a while now and linked back to when it was previously asked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reddit differs from groundhog day because we dont reach an answer to our vast numbers of existential questions the movie explores this element of life thoroughly and the depth that which it conveys makes it a classic to me if not to anyone else i highly recommend watching the film if you havent yet its really intriguing concept wise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder how long you can keep the loop going
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive seen it i think my favourite bill murray movie of all a quintessential movie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably until the sequel comes out which is in november the best thing is that we already have a link in the banner which shows how many people are i playing if you click it but people still seem to miss it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reddit differs from groundhog day because we dont reach an answer to our vast numbers of existential questions the movie explores this element of life thoroughly and the depth that which it conveys makes it a classic to me if not to anyone else i highly recommend watching the film if you havent yet its really intriguing concept wise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh god its happening
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reddit differs from groundhog day because we dont reach an answer to our vast numbers of existential questions the movie explores this element of life thoroughly and the depth that which it conveys makes it a classic to me if not to anyone else i highly recommend watching the film if you havent yet its really intriguing concept wise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think ive ever heard the phrase i dont like shit getting on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and if your boner lasts longer than four hours you can use your life alert to summon an ambulance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you clearly need to expand your knowledge of sandwich cookies in a true sandwich cookie the ornamentation is on your palate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,french macaroons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,poetic as fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know what macarons are but i think hes referring strictly to oreos and oreo knockoffs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that i am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but not quite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,da fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,da fuck agreed definitely out there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a shower thought not a guide to life upvoted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yet you could put forward quite compelling non religious arguments as to why each model can benefit a society an atheist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they all pretend to have authority that they dont really have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,k then very meaningful comment amiright
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you tried
Showerthoughts,not_removed,much meaningful wow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless youre a golden god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would anyone have a flesh colored wedding ring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ceased
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think so a large percentage of pregnancies are unplanned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably a fair bit but theres also lots of cultural expectations and values to consider
Showerthoughts,not_removed,populations are still declining even though it is enjoyable people just dont want kids in some area of the world due to their financial demands kids are expensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,much appreciated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,microwave them for a couple seconds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i want to sell ads on peoples desktops
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why we cant have nice things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like this good job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why do people use hand sanitizer you know not all bacteria is bad right you are killing millions of your own good bacteria each time you use it worse yet you are exposing the bad bacteria to it needlessly increasing the chances of them building immunity to it we only have a few effective antibacterials and nobody wants to fund the research to find another and while you are increasing the bad bactrias immunity to the antibactirial you are directly weakening your immune system and increasing your chances of getting more sick more often in the future by hey your hands might be clean so thats totally worth it right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why automatic soaphand sanitizer dispensers are a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its an easy way to clean hands when you cant otherwise there are times at work where i cant leave the kids in the room unattended but i have to clean my hands since a kid sneezed on them or something of the sorts so that helps me lots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but i have to clean my hands since a kid sneezed on them or something that would be a very good reason indeed especially if you think the kid is sick but it just seems like something way too many people use needlessly these days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,clearly you are not a golfer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bpd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my heart is tired of love
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they actually can i remember i was really sick and was couching a lot and after a few days my stomach started to hurt after every couch i went to the dectors and said that some organs werent used to so much work and couching
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet your bowels get tired tired of your shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,got em
Showerthoughts,not_removed,homeless people are homeless due to different reasons sometimes its their fault sometimes they couldnt control it tell me would you hire a homeless person who had no transportation no way to shower and ratty clothes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and whilst we are at it if you look straight out the window the earth curves away from you and you are looking straight out into space outer space we are hurtling through outer space in a huge space ship and it is a convertible with the top down
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to stand around the kitchen and do nothing for minutes when my manager asked me what i was doing and told me to get back to work i told him i was taking a smoke break he left me alone after that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everywhere ive ever worked smokers feel like they deserve extra breaks from work i aint against it im just saying i should get the same amount of time to stand around and rest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,family of four found shot dead in the woods after police used rapesniffing dogs to locate the youngest daughters teddy bear which was found near the scene gosh that makes me feel better i didnt even know any of those people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are healthier forms of escapism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or will we just skip right to holograms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holograms arent conceivably possible right now though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have drippy wang syndrome my gf has ripe vag syndrome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not entropy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seriously though playing that game drunk is hard as balls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nuh uh its a poltergeist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,murcia facepalm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre right thats why i gave the baby a sword instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say it would be scarier to see him playing with another dead baby while flashing an evil grin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant we just gut the yuppies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or the yuppie factory
Showerthoughts,not_removed,large old houses have been converted to offices and schools maybe it will happen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i find that it is quite punctilious and sententious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually its people love being pedantic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe in your world it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it isnt youre trying way too hard to be quirky but youre not funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for advice mr humour teacher
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre welcome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its almost as if humans have an advanced ability to reason and create hypotheticals in their heads to imagine how scenarios play out without having to actually go through them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats evolution
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they see your mistake and point out the faults in it seek advice from those who made the same mistakes and learned from them not those who never experienced them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because they are morons who say would of instead of would have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the thing is that actually going through it is often very different than the fantasies you can create in your mind theres all kind of factors thatll come into play in real life it can get eerie out there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and we all do it wrong because the dog tongue goes up curled backwards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,incorrect sir but i may or may not have lapped my girlfriend like a dog
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i learned this a few years ago and decided to try it first time went well second time i tried with a bottle of water and ended up soaked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did we all just find out cats are controlling the human population
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no a sudden increase in infrastructure would be good but one of the benefits of largescale building projects like that is the employment they create
Showerthoughts,not_removed,flash has mentioned that just because he can do something fast doesnt make it any less work so he probably could build infrastructure really fast but he probably wouldnt because it would be way too much work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes you can do whatever you want in life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about those places where there is no presence of building company and no jobs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you end up with people living in shacks next to a very nice highway like the slums outside beijing that the chinese demolished for the olympics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bisou bisou
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre supposed to scuff your toe and look remorsefully at the ground too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i call it freedom tax
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hello there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh christ youve gone interdimensional youre on earth not my favorite but a damned good one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes you are my interests change hourly and may depend on the type of fat ass that i saw earlier in the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but that could also mean it was the video that made you lose faith in porn and you really needed to leave
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and we welcome our new finisher category we hope you enjoy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but how does this help in private browsing incognito mode
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now really how often does that happen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,private browsing should be called privates browsing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only when the guy starts moaning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every time i finish so its really a why not both situation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,either that or the literal shits starts coming out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good good do it in imperator palpatines voice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im the opposite for some reason i think alcohol is more likely to kill the germs and backwash in beer seems less disgusting than in water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre a fucking hypocrite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was a long time ago dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a galaxy far far away bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bro im your sister derek
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine giving them their first listen to tenticle porn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a blind feature on pornhub
Showerthoughts,not_removed,once you go you never go back nsfw or anything really
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omfg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wtf did i just watch there really is a kink for everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always use google to search things on reddit you can narrow searches down to specific websites by starting with siteredditcom or even siteredditcomrshowerthoughts if you want to search specific subs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,awkward family photos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they could say your mom if they were looking for disgust
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeh that wouldnt work if you done school or kids photography but nice try
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there will probably always be an expert on board at least to be on standby in case something unexpected happens because you know automated processes take no human input to run smoothly except on the occasions when they do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not soon enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,level have sex level conceive level be secure enough to be able to keep it yeah congrats is in order theyve made a big risky life choice at that point edit spelling edit maybe good luck is a better sentiment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no shit sherlock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like the version i think someone else on this sub wrote that when my inlaws say they want grandkids theyre telling me they want me to bareback and creampie their daughter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my sister is struggling with infertility so i think a congratulations would be in order
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck that ants have babies we have nearly ten billion people already theres not a goddam thing thats noteworthy about getting knocked up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,must have missed that one but thats much stranger to think about haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you just turned a bad joke into an aborted fetus congratulations to your sister i hope her pregnancy goes well when it happens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i find this hilarious for christmas too your young brain is just starting to get a hang of this being a normal human thing social values and stuff aaaand then your parents drag a tree into your living room decorate it with shiny balls tell you that every year a fat man with a beard drives a fucking sled over your house to drop presents through your chimney and they start eating stuffing out of some animals asshole what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its just like how they did it on family guy stevie sees the costumes and flips out and unloads an magazine on the kids from his window haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my year old son has been crying and sitting rocking himself ever since halloween night hasnt been out of his room since
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we broke out masks pretty early for this reason i have a sensitive two year old who freaked out the first time someone appeared in a mask in the weeks before halloween we played with masks regularly to get her accustomed it was very successful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i saw some babies and kids at burning man i could help but wonder what they thought we were all up to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and they start eating stuffing out of some animals asshole still a better love story than twilight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should make friends with udelicatefukinflower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this joke still alive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eesh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they also run on the same wavelength as most wifi i found this out the hard way trying to stream warcraft while microwaving pizza rolls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have absolutely nothing to contribute to the human race
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they want to make sure the trends here are corresponding to facebook or the other way round
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why do so many people have facebook at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrantifacebookwikiindex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when a murder of crows stop moving are they being murdered
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no a dentist shot them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you made a time machine out of a car and this kid is from the future what type of drugs have you taken doctor brown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,going to the government and letting them know you have a working time machine would change the timeline if you could even get away and travel back to the fact the machine exists would cause the us to eventually create one or just go to dr brown and in when they hear of it and confiscate his research
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea but then they wouldnt have had an as much of an intense opening in the movie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also knowing the us government i really doubt they would just hand you back your time machine with a full tank of plutonium even if they were convinced it actually worked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh the irony
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve got great hearing hey op
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know a guy who wore sandals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt know that know it now though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats hella far away all those days and moments
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in fact its less than years away if you started college this semester you could have your doctorate by then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,black ops takes place in sounds cheesy but the technology in that game isnt really that far off now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because then the church would have a lot harder time getting people to convert which means less money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,these plot holes always throw me for a loop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone seems to have a misconception that satan himself is down in hell waiting to punish hes not he himself is getting punished as well he just needs enough souls and shit to take on god and break free from hell so its not satan whos punishing us its god and satan is getting punished along with the sinners thats what i heard from a religious person i had the same thought as you before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ever heard of the greatest trick the devil played on the world wanna see him do a keg stand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i personally believe that if there is a heaven and hell heaven is probably extremely boring while hell is one giant nonstop sin party
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you believe in fairy tales
Showerthoughts,not_removed,has anyone every eaten at in n out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if that were the case im pretty sure hes more then made his quota to overtake god seeing as there are billions of people throughout history thats werent christianslet alone in present day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually not all christians believe that not believing in god is an automatic road to hell in revelation it says that jesus will come back and rule for years then all of the people who have ever lived will come back and live for another during that second thousand years they will have a second chance to learn about him only those who still refuse to believe will be cast into the pit basically youre not condemned for not knowing about or believing in him youre condemned for rejecting him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when you say there are plenty of fish in the sea i imagine drowning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean drowning in the loneliness of our love lifes yeah same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when you say drowning i imagine trying to drown a fish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no i mean legitimately choking on water while my soulmate watches laughing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how can you drown something thats already dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when you say fish i imagine having gills cant even drown myself properly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,want to find out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no condensation is not perspiration is not precipitation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,participation s
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you sure about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blind people are always chokin on deez nuts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes they cant see him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that analogy makes absolutely no sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but every thread is a unique snow flake
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i mean how is reddit the same as a movie weve seen bef oh its all the reposts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think it gave people with insomnia something to do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone will remember how lame you are because of this post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go piss in the ocean same logic and you wouldnt have embarrassed yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they might remember me especially because they think its lame thats cool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would an internet stranger finding my showerthought not exactly to their liking embarrass me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont be too lame otherwise all your writing will get deleted and then youll never live forever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i meant your blog if this post is an indication of whatever fascinating topics youre blogging about and i dont necessarily think youd be embarrassed now but as you so astutely point out this shit tends to stick around for a bit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by lame bots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah i do this to bide my time while i shit or if my kid wakes me up and i cant get back to sleep im yelling into the void im not expecting anything from it occasionally i get interesting discourse like this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not just by any lame bots in the year world leaders shall call together a council of the best lame bots around to deal with the data droughts that plague mankind these lame bots shall decide what data is important to keep and what data belongs in the soon to be emptied recycle bin i have some good news and bad news for you literarily speaking you wont have too much competition seeing as how george rr martins cybercorpse wont have finished the winds of winter yet but there will be massive technological advances in the internet porn industry that will get most of the data priority good luck your immortality hangs in the balance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pshhh by that time most of our nonsense will have been broadcast out into the universe even after they bulldoze earth for galactic gentrification the lame bots will have to scour the universe for the last remnants of my lame blog unless theyre actually physically lame in which case i have a pretty good chance of taking them and the entire council on if i port myself into my superior bot come ooooon singularity the fate of my lame blog depends on you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you do porn your life is basically a porno
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you do porn your life is basically a porno
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope im still not over the fact that it may be pitch black inside my stomach
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is how you make it through college
Showerthoughts,not_removed,definitely not a steal for points it doesnt say karma please or anyth oh turns around and leaves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,glad im the only one who thinks this post was for the popularity steal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah im still digesting that fact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i said please
Showerthoughts,not_removed,anything we can do to free him is progress
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol why does it matter to you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with or without the bee honey nut cheerios taste exactly the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cheerios do honey nut dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about philanthropists they come from every field well not every field but a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about sport stars find them getting millions quite reasonable when one acknowledge that their careers only last for about a few years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you might need to reality check what the really means most musiciansmovie stars arent that rich
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont hate people bc ur poor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mines a giant dick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it does if the thing is a service it may no longer be a commodity but a computer program still has value because it is itself a service
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes the value of the original would fall and this new thing would gain value but neither of them would have the same value the original had not unless demand increases
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah this was basically my point that digital software music video etc can only work as services longterm because with bits it costs nearly to copydistribute therefore the monetary value of these things approaches when treated as objectscommodities
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you arent buying bits youre buying the logic that organized those bits into instructions to make your hardware perform certain actions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah pretty much you end up devaluing the copies and the original but since it cost effort who cares maybe you can sell a whole bunch for like in reality everything will cost resources and at some point it wont be worth it to make something that costs more than its worth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the physical reality with software as a commodity is you are exchanging money for copies of the bits so the intrinsic value of the work which went into the software cant be accurately represented by the monetary value of the bits which approaches due to technology whereas with software as a service you are putting money into a service which performs work and then produces the desired output in which case the monetary value corresponds to the actual work which was done i think we are agreeing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,almost i have an issue with the idea that youre paying for copies of the bits thats like saying that when you buy a house youre only paying for wood cement bricks etc an item is almost always more than the sum of its parts you have to recognize that the configuration of an item is usually more important than what its made of the value of the work which went into the software is estimated based on man hours and skill required when we make software we expect to make our invested money based on selling lots of copies for a low price or a few copies at a high price
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wtf are you getting at brah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a person blind from birth would have repurposed the brains visual cortex to do something else other than see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you dont have a cablereadytv does it matter if you have cable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and then as soon as the eyes were fixed the brain would repurpose itself to accept the new stimulus thats real basic biology
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so they would still be blind meaning the blindness is not cured so if all blindness were to be cured by definition the person would have to be able to see and function do you see what i am getting at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you need to go easy on whatever youve been smoking buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really why arent all people ambidexterous why do i shoot left but tie right have an fmri machine available ill do scans for a day for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you dont have a cablereadytv does it matter if you have cable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because there is not a biological requirement for people to be ambidextrous humans get along perfectly fine having a preferred arm but if the brain suddenly starts getting signals from a newly repaired optic nerve it is going to process that data some how
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes lets get rid of the silly analogies if any part of the optic system doesnt work eyes optic nerve brain etc then they are still blind thus your first statement lets say medical science cured blindness tomorrow would not be true making your entire line of thought built on this primary statement invalid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then why cant i shoot right fuck you about the brass im inaccurate on the right and why cant i tie left why can i jack off both equally with both hands
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok a dude with coloboma so severe from birth that he got lifeflighted to seattle and parents followed in a rv on birth that they did emergency evaluation since the kid is blind in one eye lets say they developed a drop in video camera or perfected eye transplants tomorrow would this now year old man actually be able to interpret the signals from the new eye if it were put in im thinking not since the brain fully developed without sight in the right eye
Showerthoughts,not_removed,being ambidextrous and being sighted arent related other than both are processed by the brain one is muscle memory and the other is input from a sensory organ
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if he cant then he is still considered blind in that eye blind is blind no matter which part of the optic system the problem is in thus in your example they replaced the eye but did not cure the blindness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about the guy who said instead of onety one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought teens were from to as they all finish with teen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone from are in their tens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when someone says teenage i never think they mean a year old
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont make fun of my lithp
Showerthoughts,not_removed,emmapuhmint its not difficult to say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that ith amathing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,music totally sets the mood of the scene
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really the other person could just be stubborn and you give up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you finally figured it out april fools
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have a sit down every year and do our best to stay monochrome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,umm they wear clothes am i missing a joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,asexual just means you arent interested in sex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would be up to them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still should get their own bathroom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just because youre a minority group doesnt mean you have to protest something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it does here in the states s
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alzheimers fixes everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not to be that guy you may not enjoy it this time around you and your tastes would have changed but i too wish i could reexperience it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and movies fight club

Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice try prancer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what they screwed up you mean new features
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now is an illusion the past is gone and tomorrow never arrives eat a dick edit no idea why i said eat a dick im pretty drunk carry on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too late already did now my life will never be the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by that logic spongebob should be even dumber since ya know sponge though it makes sense that squidward is intelligent octopi are said to be one of the most intelligent critters around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plankton was also spot on nauplii are parasites to crabs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and hes been living under a rock all these years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in real life can sea creatures speak english
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and candidates apparently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think homer gets stupider every year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,womens jeans have flies too theyre not just for going to the bathroom they make it easier to pull on pants try buttoning your pants with the zipper up before putting them on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hope theyll have found another better way to put on jeans than relying on the flier d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if thats pretty much exactly it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cockroaches must be winning by a lot then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is much better phrasing well done
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the ants are winning it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think we know thats not the case
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how high are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,read the series the magical states of america the first book gets into this a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but we know so little science can never explain glass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate to do this i love to do this but have you tried googling the science of glass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also its not the glass that makes the reflection in a mirror
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was just being facetious though im sure its fascinating
Showerthoughts,not_removed,here i thought you were just being an idiot you can understand my confusion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,um no thats horrific
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikikrazykripples
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,obviously because you would then absorb the fetus making it so you have another baby but this baby is a cannibal eating you from the inside out obviously obviously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i would do it but i think society would frown a bit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a truly unique thought i absolutely love it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think youve already done it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he is the faceless equivalent to steve bartman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the systems gone to pot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heyo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we need a true heroine to save the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they really methed that one up😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thc what you did there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill reefer to professionals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only weakness narcanite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if im not mistaken mething with things leads to facial tattoos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and not usually the highest quality of facial tattoo either then again what facial tattoo is ever quality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always think my dog will be coming back im not a kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you got this wrong dogs tend to be pretty loyal and they dont know what you do once you go out through the door theyll wait
Showerthoughts,not_removed,umm yes there is deuce is when both players score three points
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right but whether its all or deuce you need the next two in a row to win
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a costly smoke at that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reminds me of this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,raises hand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,many
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in comedy views since may ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pics of you with a propeller growing out of your head would be nice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would be hibernation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whatsapp has a last online time though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah coulda been talking to someone else p not just checking to see if youd been online or were checking if you were replying yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,set us a couple years back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have much more to figure out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in blade runner only police cars flew
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if we didnt have then we would see more technological changes in automobiles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the also had murderus robots that were nigh indistinguishable from humans so you take the bad with the good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but they didnt have internet in blade runner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,orit will convince up to work even harder on that offworld colony
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still got a long way to go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean they were still flying cars i couldve sworn that some of the landscapeestablishing shots showed traffic of flying cars i mean if its just police cars then thats a whole lotta police lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alright call me crazy but i would take flying cars over the internet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet youre fun at parties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ugly bags of mostly water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean a conscious bag of water and flesh held up by skin and bones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh fucking shit yes you are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet they have xray vision
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yes how could i forget
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you add that imagine the shit everyone is carrying around inside themselves lol everyone is less attractive now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i need to stop by the library on the way home amen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,amen zips up pants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id rather appear crazy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a lot packed into that one little thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can you give some examples also this might not be the best subreddit for that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well hitler did too until the end of the war
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe the term youre looking for is strategery
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah if you really look at it the terrorists won
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had more freedoms before them like not having my data harvested or not being groped on a flight from nowhere arizona to bumshart nebrahoma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know before i tried watching the show i was actually put off by the fact that he was in it bear with me a second i had previously seen him in like the old batman movie which admittedly he did a great penguin but the penguin is inherently weird matilda some b movies hes been in a lot of stuff i thought he was kinda annoyinggrating and wouldnt be very funny of course i was wrong i completely agree that the character of frank is fantastic and hilarious and after becoming a fan of iasip i couldnt imagine him not being there or it being anyone else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,season has been spectacular thus far
Showerthoughts,not_removed,basically no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lonely island has a great song for this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,takes a spicy poop yolo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am a barbarian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks civilian adviser
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a civilian but i still use the term civilian regularly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre welcome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do too i just never hear anyone else do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to be army but i know where i sit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for your service and you arent an everyday civilian good sir
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well now i am also nobody who is or used to be in the service knows how to respond to the thank you for your service thing id love to say that youre welcome but i blew up a lot of shit and had a ton of fun so it seems kind of a dick move to thank you for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you were willing to die for this great country and all the assholes who might not even deserve it and thats what counts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but it was pretty fun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a lot of friends who say the same any favorites youd be willing to share
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on a night infil i fell through a chicken coop and killed all of this poor bastards chickens it was the least professional infil of my life we were trying to get over the wall into his courtyard so we could use his roof for an op so my lt told me to go over the wall to unlatch the gate for everyone else i stood up on this old box structure and our saw gunner was going to boost me over now youve gotta be careful going over those walls because sometimes they put crushed glass on top no glass so my guy boosts me up well the whole chicken coop comes down under us with me barely holding on to the top and i learned some important lessons that day dont use iraqi chicken coops to go over walls sometimes iraqis dont mortar in the top row of cinder blocks when building a fucking courtyard wall because sure as shit the top row came off and i fell on top of my saw gunner shortly before two cinder blocks dropped directly on my fucking head it was not a shining moment in my nighttime commando portfolio me and my saw gunner had more confirmed chicken kills than anyone in my unit until we left a fact that i was reminded of when it got brought up at my promotion board by my
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow great story xd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of my favorites actually ive got a ton of great ones from iraq pretty much everyone does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well id love to hear any you want to share
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you think about it cake is just bread lasagna
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you think about it haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you need to find better restaurants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah why is it that at very fancy places sides are always a la carte but at a generic steakhouse your main dish will automatically come with at least one side
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its more of a bell curve than a liner line you can pay for a burger that youll forget youve eaten hours later for a small salad that someone spent hours assembling or about for a meal that youll be unable to finish due to it being too filling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should also be able to download your own pictures and posts to your computer easily
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should be able to sort instagram photos in any way at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude this should really be a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in german there is das rennen race and rennen to run
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then why did you use them in your username
Showerthoughts,not_removed,capital letters help distinguish if you help your uncle jack off a horse or if you help your uncle jack off a horse though so theres that i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but in this case it works thats the beauty about the christian concept of forgiveness its immediate and absolute as long as you are sincere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have to be sincere though if youre repenting just because you think judgement day is about to happen youre likely just repenting to get into heaven repenting requires remorse for your past actions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt have to be an influencefree decision fear of judgement might make someone sincerely remorseful similarly a real asshole could repent on their deathbed and that would be enough particularly since a deathbed repentance is highly likely to be sincerely made
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not debating that i know but that remorse would have to be there if judgement day doesnt happen the person in question wipes their brow and then goes right back to their old ways never missing a beat well that probably wasnt sincere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,technically yes i guess but theres tbt and people doctor their photos a lot before posting cant do that as much with a story
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always shake three times just in case someones watching
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or theyre talking about something i really have to listen to because its so interesting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or its when you get home
Showerthoughts,not_removed,condition yourself to enjoy it reward yourself with something special at the end
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uhhhh ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no wonder my parents didnt like me playing when i was young the incompetence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope cesarean are typically removed from the uterus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if he is the result of a csection then the only possibility is that hes seen a vagina from both ends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some people have died virg touché
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would like to hear what his or her life was like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah cesarean babies are delivered through the abdomen came here to post that but a bunch of people who paid attention in elementary biology or have the most basic general knowledge already did
Showerthoughts,not_removed,touché im running out of touchés
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fireworks are to a warzone the same as taking a bath is to swimming in a lake
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the rockets red glare yo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not irony its commemorative
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not what irony is if we celebrated our independence by giving back control of our country to england for a day that would be irony
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its july and its already a warzone people been lighting fireworks for damn hours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,celebrate the birth of our nation by blowing up a small part of it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the bombs bursting in air tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not to mention july had some fireworks too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,notallwomen not trying to be mean but believe me there are women out there who are so unattractive theyve never been catcalled or harassed just a fact no malicious intent theres plenty of guys who have never been hit on either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this isnt even a shower thought at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure its a fair bit more than once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not the ugly ones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when perceived victimhood makes the world go round
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone acted inappropriately to you at least once in your life lol boo fucking hoo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well so has men
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is the puss flooding in for you bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hrm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope all women maybe it doesnt happen as much but trust me it has happen at least once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn son
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont really think rape and harassment are perceived victim hood but whatever you say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rape and harassment arent catcalling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no youre wrong if a man so much as makes eye contact with a woman that is rape and he should be locked up for life dont even get me started on if he calls her pretty thats the death penalty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course and well if this hashtag has surfaced only around catcalling then ok sure i just assumed its kinda around the whole rape culture idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my childhood memories are vague like a halfremembered dream not out of focus like needing glasses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my childhood memories are blurry because they were traumatic and ive repressed them i need glasses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my childhood memories are wet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how old am i im years and march
Showerthoughts,not_removed,born on january can confirm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was born in april and i still forget the year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thought ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im from june and still use that strategy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you mean thought instead of though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ehh here just minus a year and yer good to go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my sisters born on jan its good but its not quite carling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was born in i just take the current year and add
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont care
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think that is how it works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i close my eyes i see everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for both eyes the combined visual field is ° vertical and ° horizontal httpsenwikipediaorgwikihumaneyefieldofview
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre looking toward half the universe although youre missing almost all the detail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,definitely not how that works lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not a lot other than maybe in the case of knowing that theyve always been socioeconomically secure and are just negligent but other than that it tells you their socioeconomic history a bit only
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cause it cost money to use your nose to breath httpconsciousbreathingcomarticlesmouthbreathingnegativelyaffectchildrenssmileteethfaceairways i get some dental problems can only be fixed with money but billion years of evolutionary success didnt lead to complicated chompers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you cant honestly be that stupid i refuse to believe you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tape your kids mouth shut at night wtf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre probably a filthy mouth breather anyways cause you clearly didnt read the article
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats obviously a bit much but you got the point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the article has absolutely nothing to do with the apparent visual cleanliness of teeth at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you think toothpaste and toothbrushes are a sign of wealth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take a kid have them brush every day religiously and never see a dentist the outcome isnt necessarily pretty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and brakechecking is the equivalent of getting slapped in the face by your older sister with her wolverine like fingernails
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we dont grow up we just grow old
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and rearending the car in front of you is the childhood equivalent of tag youre it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh jeezz just get over
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more like the adult version of im a douchebag
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh good heavens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and then insurance or your parents get involved
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what did i say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not sure i understand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean youre spot on edit i hate when kids do that so the adult version is definite douchebaggery
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can we shoot the harambe memes yet cause i feel like its time for them to die already
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not taking away a meme its shooting a zombie meme in the head zombie harambe theres a thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they couldnt cheat in jumanji remember what happened to that little boy who wanted to get certain numbers from his dice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cheating is not tolerated the little boy tried to and was turned into a monkey
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like they need a better dm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you shit in your bed i think youre doing something wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,infants arent supposed to post on reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,explain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where is the age minimum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh boy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomhelpuseragreement theres also a httpswwwredditcomwikireddiquette which seems to be be largely lost on users these days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your comment made me laugh out loud so thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh man everyone takes this so seriously its a shower thought but a joke come on bud the sentiment is that makingcleaning your bedtoilet is nearly redundant to a degree love you man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,did you think i really thought you were an infant love you too buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol i wish i thought that would be way too funny on my end
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that a shower thought or did u just type down the definition
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought we were
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in short yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,another unrealistic expectation generalizing cattle like a herd you think the only people who are people are the people who look and graze like you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes colours are essentially light at different wavelengths so things you hear such as infrared and ultraviolet are colours of wavelengths beyond the spectrum of what is visible to us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe so and in fact i have heart language culture can effect perception of colour here is a link i found after a very quick search
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fax machines are also plugged into the wall u dingus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rocks have been around for billions of years and yet my damned jackhammer cant break concrete without an air compressor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,came here to say this imagine when heshe finds out about fibre
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you almost had it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do we really pay to be here or do we just pay for conveniences
Showerthoughts,not_removed,may not be monetary but a large amount of other species have had to pay to coexist with us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ya but when were hungry we also dont have to chase down a guy choke him out and then eat his fresh corpse completely raw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre welcome to go live in the woods for free no one is stopping you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,animals are paying alot more than humans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,key to reducing social stress people dont think about your faults nearly as much as you think they do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i make it feel less awkward by mumbling to myself about how its normal to change directions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aliens 👽
Showerthoughts,not_removed,michael imperioli
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mind blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and when it comes to school buses there would be no way to make the children stay in them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,buses are better designed to protect their passengers and drivers have to have commercial licenses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i work for a city bus agent in our training for loss of brake control we where advised to hit movable objects to slow us down such as light poles a city bus sees even large passenger vehicles as a soccer ball and hitting one is worse than a literal brick wall
Showerthoughts,not_removed,buses arent usually involved in accidents not that they are crash proof crazy shit happens but probably not often enough to cause seatbelts to be necessary much like a train doesnt have seatbelts when a train crash is a million times worse then if a bus gets t boned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres an by the uks former railway safety standards board from about ten years ago on the subject of seatbelts in trains written in the wake of a railway crash at ufton nervet where seven people died after a man commited suicide by parking on a level crossing the accident was only that severe because of the derailed train getting caught on some points slightly further up the track incidentally it was a problem with points that caused the accident at grayrigg a few years later ironically a couple of months before the attached report was published which only caused one death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relevant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a corollary to sturgeons law of people arguing for any particular viewpoint have zero idea what theyre talking about they make stupid mistakes misunderstand the principles at work and fight the wrong battles regardless of what point they seem to stand for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup been on the other end of this had a misunderstanding and suddenly a hero comes to defend the girl and of course label me the villain fortunately the girl was more interested in resolution than being rescued
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but yet im still alone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,could you please express it as a decimal for those of us who dont fractions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just use your vest problem solved
Showerthoughts,not_removed,something i dont need while reading reddit with the other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are different brands out there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you ever try folding it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,use a thimble i just saved you money op
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yer shits too soggy use a bidet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a brilliant idea shshao
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id be pretty impressed that he could even produce that much semen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would hes in prison maybe some random employees or some corporate head
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i take it youve never worked retail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree specifically with the harambe shit fuck alllll of that meme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats interesting care to explain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when you work retail you have homicidal thoughts at least four times a shift
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im with my self lol ustillnotpartying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relationships are timing also dont be ugly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like your outlook
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mine tend to get in interracial relationships society wont like white and black socks being paired but theyll be damned if they care
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats really friggin scary is when one sock is slightly larger than the others maybe it sneaked into the lint trap and gorged itself i dunno but its creepy as hell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyones got a soul mate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i only buy socks that match they all get thrown together in some huge orgy when any any one needs to be replaced they are all replaced
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is some kind of euphoric utopia that you must be referring to matching socks vanish into a black hole forever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gma always said it was better to separate the colors from the whites
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyones got a sole mate ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sole mate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that seems a bit excessive why not donate the remaining loser socks and hope for the best lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sidles up you seem really cool bro got any weed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to whom have you ever seen used socks for sale at goodwill no homeless shelter i know of will use them i actually do donate them i presume that they upcycle them into rags that they can sell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sock puppets
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many is are there lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe they will also like naming themselves al
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meanwhile of the world probably dont have a cent to give
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but a cent goes a hell of a lot further in less developed countries than it does here exchange rates work incredibly favorably for us and even though a penny is nothing to you there are countries where one cent is a nontrivial sum of money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like the nigerian prince
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i imagine a bunch of starving african kids crying and holding up pennies to some rich asshole in a tophat lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha nice imagination i can totally picture me in the tophat once i get the mill i will but these african kids some food
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sadly not something you can do in the shower unless theres already one or more guys in there with you at the same time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not how this works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how soooo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,budweiser is the michelob of beer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh how wrong you are this is norman theuerkorn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was one hell of a year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hashtag killmenow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ugly birthdays come thru
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more like meowmorized amirite im right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are a national treasure marry me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a deal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like the heart of the ocean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why did this get removed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thered be less road rage if people used signalturn lights period
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i turn my signal on then three seconds later i go thats how it should be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,here in texas and louisiana thats exactly what it means me or anyone using their signal light means move im makin my way on in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought it ment you noticed a gap in my lane and you wanted me to close it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha no i feel like it would increase trolling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would be nice too every time im out and someone uses a light it looks like most people take it as a well time to drive like a cunt approach and cuts them offslows downspeeds up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude youre missing out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,use toaster get it super toasted like crazy hot darkened moments away from catching your house on fire toasted works extremely well with cherry and brown sugar flavors your life will never be the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seriously toast them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i eat them cold get on my level
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i for one welcome our new artificial intelligence based overlord
Showerthoughts,not_removed,climate change sure truly artificial intelligence i think were still centuries away from that in spite of all the amazing things that we think computers are doing they are still incapable of a creative thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,observe the nature of the world and report your findings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,socks are clothing for your feet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you do know condoms are not used to keep your dong warm right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone wears socks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,resorting to water sports with your brother dude get out more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a chat with my friends last night about people who get drunk and piss in random places did you know you were doing it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and yet they all were
Showerthoughts,not_removed,perhaps in the sense that they are harvested for precious dollars economies thriving on cancer and sweet sweet heat disease read gary taubes and do some thinking carbs are have been and continue to kill us thanks for the thought btw this is what keeps healthcareinsurance so expensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take zoloft
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its because just hanging out is rather boring when there is a world to explore willing to bet that even if youve lived in the town youre in right now for years you could find plenty of cool things and interesting locations to go see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not depressed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,humans are gullible spin a good enough story and people will believe you sans photoshop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no santa is accually your parents he dosent exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why are you specifically mentioning iphones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good question i dont know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see you and wiz have similar hobbies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but piss and whiz are synonyms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol touche
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shit khalifa wasnt as funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they can become the state nothing stopping them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,will be mourning are happier than pigs in shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if only i could use this without plagiarizing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can someone please explain why if the reason is that theyve lost a lot of territory in the americas i dont think they still care maybe someone from uk can tell us whats the general feeling on that it would be interesting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,speak for yourself idk why you think the majority would decide to leave while also being sad about it you know how voting works right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,present sacrifice for future gain yes their financial picture is down today but they will rebound and they will be out from under the thumb of european autocrats and their ridiculous regulations taxation and immigration only dimwits will be mourning the gain of freedom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can we swap mississippi for them that way we can keep our flag also wed no longer have mississippi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doesnt the us already have states as it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uk just recently left the eu thus becoming independent many people in the uk are not happy about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,their stock and worth plummeted they no longer have guaranteed support from the european union and so many people are trying to leave the country because of the decision it was so bad that a number of locations ran out of immigration forms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually they already have countries wanting to strike trade deals with them so its really not that dire in fact they will probably be well off more quickly than most people realize
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whichever state we swap we need to send all of our rapists murders and general undesirables there first turn it into some kind of isolated penal colony that would be ausome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres puerto rico but thats a commonwealth then theres a few other things as well but nobody cares about them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in my experience of public political interest its more like and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for the explanation i get it now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for the explanation i get it now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this messes me up harder than you can imagine right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the play button on your phone is also likely the pause button
Showerthoughts,not_removed,barely only on the games when one hasnt unpaused
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its used equally as much to start a game via unpausing it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well in many games there is a start screen that requires the start button to be pressed also it is used to start the game after pausing as mentioned by
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its all about perspective
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in all seriousness how hard would that be to do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also rig the backboards to shatter in the fourth quarter boom shaka laka
Showerthoughts,not_removed,boom shakalaka
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the ads arent supposed to make you want to buy the product the ads establish brand name recognition so that when you are buying shit youll see something you recognize and choose them over their competitor that you dont recognize
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they dont spend billion of dollars on advertising without thinking this through
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only ads that have made me buy things are ones from youtubers im subscribed to that have sponsorship deals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre apparently quite young and statistically that means you probably dont have a ton of disposable income so youre not even the primary demographic for advertisers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah this isnt true though lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ehh not really that is part of it im sure but commercials for mcdonalds or coke wouldnt still exist if that was the so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i skip every ad i can on youtube if they are the ones that you cant skip then i mute my laptop and change tabs until it is done not on facebook im with op
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is still verry young fuck yea but yea i have a well paying job and no kids but im still frugal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they would because of competition its not good enough that pepsi is well known and coke is well known they have commercials to raise peoples opinion and desire for their product over other equally recognizable brands
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bu that still doesnt make me go to my fridge and get a coke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have no idea what you are talking about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk about this kid but id smell them and pick the one i find pleasant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok get it now i am an advertisers nightmare no cell phone no facebook barely watch tv dont buy brand name clothes and only buy for next season when marked down this season like summer clothes at the end of summer for next year when super cheap most of my hobbies are next to free hiking tinkering in the shed etc when i see product placement i laugh at how blatant it is and how much apple must pay to get their crap on movies i guess it must work though because companies keep spending money on advertising
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not particularly as long as you interact with anyone at all the things they recommend reached them at some point through an ad and as i mentioned before most things that are blatant are not the actual focus of the marketer theyre designed so you see them and ignore them thinking youre the special group who is unaffected by advertising then when your guard is down the actual conversion happens and trust me of people have no idea they are ads the other all work in or with ad companies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or they could introduce a gassing up mechanic and make the game a whole lot more interesting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i played a game where you had to go to gas stations was it driver maybe either way it was really fun charting out where the stations were and planning for it suddenly gas stations actually had meaning besides decoration
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you cant really mow snow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see them called snow thrower sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you cant even type properly i doubt that you are a person of success
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and still never got it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,until they had to get gas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,touché my car though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am a noncolinear thinker okay no you cant be one too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the teacher can give it the kid just cant do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,technically we do buy money every dollar the government prints is on loan from the federal reserve at damn near a interest rate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre on salary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can ask your employer not to remove tax and just pay the income tax at the end of the year also i dont understand how your statement means we buy money i would agree that we barter for money i mean we exchange a good or service for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,god damnit youre right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess throws arms
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless it is a oneway street
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are still on the right side of the road
Showerthoughts,not_removed,driving in left lane of oneway street puts me on the left side of the street
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but it is still the right side as long as it isnt a wrong way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sigh ok never mind i am in the slooow lane
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you were just fishing for that joke werent you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the whole thing does suggest an ingenious insurance scam i would take it as a given that the bored and the conspiracy theorists have already checked if mr kim kardashian stopped his concert before the robbery of mrs kim kardashian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chance of it been faked and a chance of it been a insurance scam and chance of it been another make me relevant again media project i make that a chance of been a load of bollocks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wasnt kanye broke maybe he did it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im actually surprised that she has not been robbed before now consider that she is a person whose job is to tell everyone how rich she is and what she is doing she is broadcasting all the information a robber would need
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how did homegirl plead for her life when she was bound and gagged
Showerthoughts,not_removed,although didnt they recently fire their bodyguard in a largely publicized manner any chance hes behind it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why i havent really looked into so im not saying your wrong i just want to know your reasoning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a few years ago there was this airplane prank where some people convinced some other kardasianlike celebrity that the plane they were in was going to crash and they were all going to die i felt really bad for her and then a day later she said she was part of the prank so yeah im not feeling sorry for these celebrities ever again even if it wasnt staged for attention shes still going to get the attention so it almost may as well have been changed i totally wouldnt put it past her to do that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you watched the show you would have seen khloe claiming she was robbed about a year ago from her closet drawer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a prank bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is generous stop white knighting shes not gonna sleep with you dude wait this is kim k she actually might
Showerthoughts,not_removed,better check rconspiracy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt sound that ingenious really i am sure this is a standard insurance fraud scenario in fact i am pretty sure it has been used by many stories tv shows and movies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,umm im not sure that analysis is statistically sound of people could tell you that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plus chance of annoying me and wish that reddit every single fucking media outlet would stop being obsessed with everything that couple does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i aint saying he a gold digger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think that was cent same person different body
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its the kardashians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but if i watched the show id be so lame i probably wouldnt be able to type well enough to even contribute to this thread so you know sacrifices
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt do that to kanye
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for money or attention yes but not for defending her honour
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it looks like fascinating reading there thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah most likely although distracting from the crime scene by stopping a concert on the other side of the world is a dynamic new twist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of all redditors are a statistic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you might be correct on both counts but i believe that statistically i have a high chance of been correct in my analytical assumptions and i believe that of the that you mentioned would agree with any statistics no matter how much they were manipulated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are percent of the people who will vote for the conspiracy no matter what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am with you there stop making idiots famous but sometimes one rises to the bait just to let the world know we are not fooled by manufactured celebs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kanye did make a statement a while back that he was million in debt it was never proven though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,case closed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with kanye you mean and you would
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget your tinfoil hat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just another fitting alibi aaand where were you at the time of the crime mr west been black anall i was working will anyone vouch for that sir
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont call me a statistic good day sir
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres only a chance of that statement being true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,enh yeah probably
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fishdicks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would imply i ever take it off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i said good day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gotta take whatever you can on reddit when stats start coming up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im so good at selfdeprecating jokes it makes me wanna kill myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive actually played pool for over years now and know your not going to clean your room any better by being good at bowling or any sport that requires you to clean your equipment twice a year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,looking back the same applies to anything positive about yourself thats why its a selfdeprecating joke this made more sense at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well she doesnt mean it as a joke but its funny to the viewers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,photos in harry potter universe are normal photos you forgot that muggle world still constitutes much of harry potter universe and magic photos arent technically photos
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they are shadows of reality the people in the pictures are literally reflections of reality born of magic they can move between pictures to other pictures talk with people and they even think and speak so no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no thats portraits photos only loop a certain scene or action and portraits are the ones that are halfsentient
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im talking about photos photos only loop the same action or scene and the people in them arent aware of the outside portraits are the ones that are halfsentient
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean the ones in the newspapers like the sirious escapes one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmm ive been awake too long maybe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always think similar about smoking if i introduced some new product tomorrow that not only killed you but also made you become completely addicted id be facing jail time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and yet cannabis is a schedule controlled substance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,system is more than a bit broken
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no no it wouldnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,while alcohol is definitely quite bad there are far worse drugs out there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell that to the natives
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not sure what you mean by old but i have found that as i have aged the people i find most attractive are similar in age to me at that particular time i have read that people can be sexually active at all ages i hope i never go dormant and just give up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk but when i was in school i found my class girls attractive and now i find my coworkers attractive so maybe yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like women of all ages
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant find the study right bow but basically women tend to like men of approximately their own age up until about men like and year old women from puberty until death in general i just googled and found some mainstream news articles on it easily but i cant be bothered finding the original studies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not that old men are impotent its that old women are so very ugly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both definitely both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who knows but tell us how it goes years from now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,consider this depending on how old you are now do you still consider boys you liked at an age attractive in their stage at that time eg would you now still crush on your crush i am and if i look at an old picture of one of the or so i feel they look very baby even with guys i like now i often feel their ten year younger self wouldnt be appealing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably bothsigh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fifty years old here i find women my age attractive and women much younger attractive in different ways somebody in their twenties may have physical beauty but they dont tend to share life experiences that are remotely life my own and as great as sex can be you can only do or talk about it so much id much rather date somebody who is pretty and who can hold up their end of a dinner conversation somebody who isnt still trying to figure out things that i settled twenty five years ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you just cope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,remindme years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see for me the boys i fancied at if i see a picture of them it still stirs up those feelings so there is still an attraction there even if im now in my however seeing just random year olds isnt exactly something that turns me on having said that i can find anyone attractive if they look a certain way be they or this however doesnt mean i want to have sex with a child just that its perfectly natural to admire and have your body respond to attractive people who have at least started puberty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes dogs know youre pregnant and do treat you differently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so do cats they dont see a pregnant woman they see a nice comfy ledge on which to snooze
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know they can sense the changes i just wondered if they could actually hear it itd be pretty fucking cool if they could
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know my dog would snuggle up to my wifes belly ear first pretty frequently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hopefully without a musk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no they wont tesla is in the process of mass producing affordable vehicles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure they might be one or two already
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no because strippers dont use their real names
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some strippers are reasonably priced and will comfortably accommodate families of four
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mentioned an alternative visualization of the number line one alternate visualization is the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiextendedrealnumberline another one which i suspect you might particularly enjoy due to the visual completeness is the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprojectivelyextendedrealline theres another nice visualization in httpwwwmathvanderbilteduschectexcoursestherealspotentialhtml which is also a good read related to this topic you are certainly not alone in having some conniptions about the number zero its been a blessing and a curse for eons its relationship to infinity is confounding the related concepts have been argued by the best minds how far down does the rabbit hole go one might jokingly say all the way the history of mans struggle with zero and infinity has a surprising reach into general philosophy philosophy of math philosophy of science religion logic and language i do encourage you to follow the rabbit hole to see where it leads you some things youve said are similar to the issue of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiemptysetquestionedexistence most interesting to me is the history of calculus the problem of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinfinitesimal which were originally thought of as something like a nonzero value represented by the very heated arguments eventually lead to the formal epsilon delta ε δ definition of the limit there was much rejoicing among many scientists and mathematicians after that since they were finally able to sidestep the problem of infinitessimals and their dangerous association with zero infinitessimals were famously derided by berekely as ghosts of departed quantities see also httpplatostanfordeduentriescontinuity truely understanding the significance of the formulation of the ε δ definition of the limit is enlightening however these little tiny almostzero numbers called infinitessimals made a comeback with httpsenwikipediaorgwikinonstandardanalysis we clearly have distinct types of numbers but each category has its own uses and associated problems also some operations may be undefined but for a variety of reasons the preference is to still include the numbers asis and accept that some combinations of operations and numbers create undefined results examples below especially closure for example one could say that negative numbers are not numbers since sqrtnegativenumber is undefined we dont throw out negative numbers from the real numbers just because is undefined for real numbers if we only consider positive integers the operation x y is undefined for all yx we dont throw out all positive numbers just because of the undefined nature of some subtractions also one can use your imaginary numbers dont really exist so it needs to be a different category argument for negative numbers as well you can never have eggs in a basket your objection to zero is based on its relationship to infinity there are two issues to this first zero is not infinity so its relationship to infinity does not necessarily exclude it second youre making an assumption that if a standard operation such as division by zero creates something that is not a number or undefined then the offending entity zero is not a number the problem youre describing here is related to httpsenwikipediaorgwikiclosuremathematics a set has closure under an operation if performance of that operation on members of the set always produces a member of the same set in this case we also say that the set is closed under the operation for example the integers are closed under subtraction but the positive integers are not is not a positive integer even though both and are positive integers another example is the set containing only zero which is closed under addition subtraction and multiplication because and but removing zero from real numbers just trades one closure problem for another if zero is not a real number then the operation xyz produces a real number z except for all xy which is preferrable to say that division by zero is the only case where a simple arithmetic operation fails closure for real numbers or to have real numbers miserably fail closure under subtraction youve also mentioned that infinity isnt a number but on what basis can you make this assertion as indicated previously one may simply define it as a number and demonstrate its location on a numbercircle as opposed to numberline the projectively extended real line httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprojectivelyextendedreallinedividingbyzero but it breaks some other nice things about real numbers ultimately you are absolutely justified to question the nature of zero as a number it is special it is troublesome as well as helpful in some ways its not like other numbers but in other ways it is like other numbers but this can also be said when comparing rationals to naturals negatives to positives and irrationals to rationals leopold kronecker is famous for writing god made the integers all else is the work of man you may want to look into httpsenwikipediaorgwikiphilosophyofmathematics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is a number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is your definition of a number would you say negative irrational and imaginary numbers are numbers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a mathematical sense it is a number draw a number line but in every day terms youre right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its one degree outside then the temperature goes down by one degree does that mean you cant measure the temperature
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alright dude didnt we figure out how zero works back in like the roman times is the earth flat as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,um edit formatting issues
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks this is very fascinating
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can perform arithmetic operations on numbers only one arithmetic operation on zero leads to a nonredundant answer x c and that one is basically an identity moreover one arithmetic operation is undefinable zero does not have the properties of a number so it is not a number it is akin to infinity in being an abstract concept rather than a number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my definition would strictly relate to quantities including relative quantities so that would include irrationals so there would need to be a different term for the nonreal domains negatives are numbers as symmetrical reflections of positives
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because thats one number not seven of them just because seven symbols are used to denote the one doesnt change that the significance of the symbols is that million dollars is added to dollar the zeros indicate that no value is added in that decimal place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i suppose part of my thought is that the practice of putting it on the number line is logically faulty that it would be akin to claiming that anywhere on the number line is infinity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that means youre setting to mean something other than zero temperature only the kelvin scale has meaning absence of temperature
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt we figure out how zero works back in like the roman times apparently not if you still think its a number despite all the reasons it isnt see the other comments is the earth flat as well only if it had zero curvature
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt know wikipedia had authority over reality guess ill make some choice edits to a few biographical pages
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is akin to infinity in being an abstract concept rather than a number are you suggesting that numbers like are not abstract concepts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do you mean by relative quantities and when you say there would need to be a different term for the nonreal domains do you mean that imaginary numbers are not numbers or in other words are you saying the following all numbers in the set of r reals except for zero are numbers nothing else is a number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it is not a real number lets use is on the number line approaching or any other number in fact would be would be infiniti if you havent studied limits or calculus yet youll learn this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only the kelvin scale has meaning absence of temperature so you agree that zero degrees fahrenheit is not an absence of temperature if that temperature using the fahrenheit scale does not equal the number zero then what is it as another example on the moment magintude scale for earthquakes does not mean no earthquake i suppose you are going to argue that these scales are unnatural i dont have any response to that except to say that the modern world runs on this kind of math refusing to accept as a number you can calculate with is choosing to live in the dark ages if you agree to calculate with it then the question of whether or not it is really a number is just philosophical bullshit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so what are you trying to prove here then just trying to look smart or is this actually groundbreaking is a number but for example if i have pieces of candy represents an absence of candy logically but is still a number what the hell else is it a brick a reclining chair its a number this requires no further explanation why why is this a problem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you missed the point its the fastest way to find articles and books related to a specific topic there are references on the topic of the number zero on wikipedia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you suggesting that numbers like are not abstract concepts three is physically identifiable zero and infinity are not and zero introduced into physical equations tends to result in infinities and undefinable results when you explore the implications thats why units are usually chosen to avoid zero when it would be untenable would you say or deny that negative and imaginary numbers are numbers despite their very abstract nature i would say that imaginaries are called numbers as a matter of convenience but that its probably not valid to put them in the same broad category as integers they are more like a process whose immediate outcome being nonexistent is ignored for the sake of subsequent operations that do exist sort of like a method of avoiding potholes on a road that is otherwise a much shorter path to the destination than a smoother one an abstract shortcut from one thing that exists to another thing that exists but in between is just abstract structure negatives are numbers because they are just reflections of positives and the relationship between the two is arbitrary they have the same nature in opposite directions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do you mean by relative quantities for instance the relation of a circumference and a radius ie pi that is a quantity and therefore a number just not a rational and when you say there would need to be a different term for the nonreal domains do you mean that imaginary numbers are not numbers by this logic they would be classified as something else not that i see any particular consequence to that reclassification its mainly zero that seems to have practical significance if treated differently or in other words are you saying the following all numbers in the set of r reals except for zero are numbers nothing else is a number yes except insofar as that stating an exception is unnecessary if we dont regard zero as real to begin with admittedly that leaves the number line with a hole in it meaning some alternative visualization might be more insightful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a real number lets use is on the number line approaching or any other number in fact would be would be infiniti usually thats only if youre dealing with a function where there is an asymptote at do you have a limit approaching infinity and the most common reason you would end up with an asymptote in a function is that it would result in a zero denominator ie a condition whose nonexistence cannot be glossed over but otherwise numbers are not asymptotic basically youve provided another example of my point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kelvin is not based on boiling points zero kelvin is the absence of temperature and it too does not actually exist anymore than zero is a number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you agree that zero degrees fahrenheit is not an absence of temperature only because zero fahrenheit is defined as a nonzero absolute temperature it literally means nothing more than that a number line on a thermometer is moved and the notches spaced differently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but for example if i have pieces of candy represents an absence of candy logically but is still a number how can something not existing be a number is someone who doesnt exist also a person what the hell else is it a brick a reclining chair a mathematical abstraction in the same way as infinity which is also not a number this requires no further explanation why why is this a problem its not a problem its interesting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are any of them relevant to its status as a number or are we to ignore the argument and pretend that an article heading is evidence of something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an abstract shortcut from one thing that exists to another thing that exists but in between is just abstract structure what is your definition of exists does exist other than its utilitarian process should be considered a number even though it doesnt really exist other than its utilitarian process
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes that is all any number ever means there is no real one degree temperature only the one we choose does that mean that one isnt a number zero is no different
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also are you this salty that you have to downvote all of my comments is this a joke you really feel the need to do that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all of them are relevant and point to its status as a number get past the article heading and read lets say the first reference matson john august the origin of zero its a short and very informative article about how it came to be and how it developed into what it is today if still not convinced move to the next reference and so on after thousands of years of development im not sure there is an argument here and if this was a troll post then the jokes on me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can be directly related to physical phenomena
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes that is all any number ever means and that proves my point because if zero can be treated as a variable and set to any underlying value and yet still has to be excluded from domains because of divisor undefinability treating it as a number results in the entire number line being excluded there is no real one degree temperature only the one we choose and yet there is always finite nonzero temperature zero eludes us in reality just as infinity does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all of them are relevant and point to its status as a number they use the word number thats an assumption not an argument matson john august the origin of zero doesnt actually describe why zero is considered a number nor offer any counterargument to the reasons why it wouldnt be after thousands of years of development im not sure there is an argument here and if this was a troll post then the jokes on me no one will deny that the concept lacks utility and thats all thats necessary for something to have been adopted in history the problem is that it breaks down logically this is not a troll post and the implication is disgusting just because you are surrounded by an assumption does not make it valid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant think of any reason why you would divide by a temperature so the problem of dividing by zero will not arise if you have an example be my guest youre right that coming up with an easily discernible example of zero in reality is not easy in that way it is similar to infinity the difference is that it is possible to build up a logical arithmetic in which zero is a number we have to exclude division by zero but all other combinations are allowed this cost is worth the benefit of having general solutions to equations such as xy a if you fix two of the numbers you can always calculate the third side note do you think that negative numbers are numbers infinity cannot be incorporated into the system in this way suppose that x equals infinity then clearly since they are both infinity subtract x and you have the whole system falls apart zero does not cause the system to fall apart except division by zero so it has been allowed in ill try a different tack what is the probability that a coin will land on heads and tails at the same time if there is no probability then the complementary event that it does not land on heads and tails at the same time should not have a probability either since it is a general rule that the sum of their probabilities is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not the only one who suggested this might be a joke i believe you also called me unintelligent before editing the post you said zero eludes us in reality just as infinity does what reality zeroinfinite apples zeroinfinite dollars thats only half of it the half to which you cling zero is a number in all exact sciences and to all us unintelligent and disgusting people that think this is a joke post i dont have the time the energy nor the will to change what you believe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant think of any reason why you would divide by a temperature there are tons of algebraic operations in physics where you would divide by a temperature thats why the equations usually demand the temperature be expressed in kelvin so that you dont end up with asymptotes and nonsensical results if you have an example be my guest there are countless examples solving or luminosity for one of the other variables comes instantly to mind we have to exclude division by zero but all other combinations are allowed thats the unavoidable rub that special condition that distinguishes zero from the other locations assigned to the number line and that suggests putting it there at all has some flaw in logic this cost is worth the benefit of having general solutions to equations such as xy a if you fix two of the numbers you can always calculate the third i dont dispute the utility of treating zero as a number under conditions where it can produce useful results but to my mind that doesnt reflect fundamental nature and failing to question its position as a number may perhaps conceal other useful possibilities just as never having considered that it might be a number had in ancient times concealed the useful methods you mention in ancient society zero did not fail to be treated as a number because it was thoroughly understood it was treated as not a number because it was just assumed that it wasnt a number now we assume it is because weve found some utility in treating it as such under some conditions but maybe theres more to explore side note do you think that negative numbers are numbers yes i think they describe symmetries since they are reflections the fact that zero is indifferent to which side is positive and which negative is i think another intuitive indication that zero is a flawed concept as a number some other conception is called for infinity cannot be incorporated into the system in this way suppose that x equals infinity then clearly since they are both infinity subtract x and you have the whole system falls apart zero does not cause the system to fall apart except division by zero so it has been allowed in but that exception division by zero cannot be overcome except with arbitrary domain statements that are like selective surgery to make one animal look like another in fact the problem is virtually the same as you describe with infinity an arithmetic operation yielding real results while its reverse yields a contradiction if we claim that a nonzero real number c divided by equals a real number then we reverse it by multiplying that number by zero its impossible that the resulting number would be nonzero what is the probability that a coin will land on heads and tails at the same time if there is no probability then the complementary event that it does not land on heads or tails at the same time should not have a probability either since it is a general rule that the sum of their probabilities is the sum of finite probabilities is neither infinite nor zero probabilities would apply if its correct that zero is the absence of value rather than a number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now that i think of it what do you think of the concept that maybe its a nonreal number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not the only one who suggested this might be a joke being wrong is often a team sport but lets get back to talking about the concept what reality zeroinfinite apples zeroinfinite dollars what color are zero apples what color are zero dollars they dont have a color because they dont exist because zero is not a number or lets be more rigorous and say at least that its not a real number i dont have the time the energy nor the will to change what you believe if you dont have the time energy or will to examine your assumptions im happy to examine them for you i just hope you will not resent my exploring ideas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks for the examples of dividing by a temperature we can agree that whether or not zero is a number you want to avoid division by it use of kelvin or rankine makes sense here it sounds like your background is in physics and mine is in math which makes this an interesting discussion of course that depends on how we define number the standard mathematical construction of the real numbers includes zero as a number and not infinity so i cant agree to call it a nonreal number im open to calling it something else note for other reasons i think that real is a ridiculous name for that structure but it is the standard terminology going to dinner have more to say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes physical background so i admit i may be seeing this obtusely since i instinctively want math to be justified by physical phenomena on the other hand i do also think that zero as an abstract concept needs to be distinguished at least from reals zeros invariably lead to infinities so intuitively they seem to be related
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is no question that zero has unique properties and that those properties are similar to infinity the reason why everyone was disagreeing with you was that we have mostly agreed to use certain logical structures to do math and those structures treat zero as a number whether zero or infinity is really a number is just a question of definition it is not a natural number it is not a positive number it is a rational number it is not a prime number it is an algebraic number it is not a transcendental number it is a real number just depends on which set youre talking about in calculus zero and infinity are very closely related and they cause similar problems in calculation for certain purposes we use something called the extended real numbers namely the real numbers infinity and minus infinity infinity is not a real number but it is an extended real number zero is both when in school for math i learned that you can start with a semigroup an algebraic structure with very relaxed properties and construct a group an algebraic structure with nicer properties you can start with the natural numbers and addition as the semigroup do this construction and the integers including zero will fall out i tried doing the construction on the natural numbers plus infinity and addition which is also a semigroup the construction worked its guaranteed to but it resulted in complete collapse of the structure a group with a single element im wondering what you would get if you did this same construction starting with the natural numbers plus infinity and multiplication i havent tried it yet i can guarantee that whatever you get would be the same as the natural numbers plus zero and multiplication since if x is either infinity or zero and n is a natural number then xnnxx in this particular situation zero and infinity are identical i suspect it will collapse again dont have time to try it today but will let you know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,another thing to consider is whether zero can be defined in the same terms as the rest of the number line if zero has to be defined by what is absent then altering the rest of the line to be defined likewise would be very strange eg would have to be every number that is not and every number thats not etc maybe thats worth exploring as an alternative to removing zero but now im getting too abstract for my own comfort zone so ill just leave that as a random thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my response as a onetime pure mathematician is not to worry about what mathematical objects are just worry about their place within the structure when you go all the way down here are the standard definitions is the number you start with from which all others come the only operation youre allowed to do is get the next number which ill write as yes is constructed differently there are still other constructions for negative numbers rational numbers pi and so on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just realized there no hype about the games this year at alli forgot they were even happening
Showerthoughts,not_removed,going to be a challenge to fill the down time between events with all the uplifting stories they usually do its going to a train wreck in the middle of a forest fire with the black plague thrown in for fun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no they had federation credits but they decided to go to a smaller junk dealer who wouldnt take the credits yeah that makes sense if you need a specific part lets go to the small junk dealer who doesnt take your form of payment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably because anxiety and depression hurt the person with those conditions but narcissism hurts people surrounding the narcissist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the narcissist i know do not suffer from depression or anxiety they are control freaks bullies and nonsympathetic to other peoples emotions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was my gut reaction too but depression and anxiety can hurt the people around them profoundly maybe its more because narcissism doesnt hurt the one with the condition at least not directly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my point was that all three are mental health problems – sicknesses and yet they are treated so differently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you got it thats what i was trying to say but didnt express properly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think the difference though is narcissists dont see themselves as being sick just superior but i understand the relation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fair enough doing further research i found that depression and anxiety arent actually personality disorders like narcissism so i may have been a little misguided in the first place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the similar thing here is that at some points you have to stop looking for scientific facts to back up your claim because you cant find anythis is a metaphysical subject it is wrong to use a scientific approach to handle such deep topics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are not making much sense how does proving any scientific theory to be true prove a god exists that may work specifically for simulation theory which btw scientists dont think is more than likely but rather experimental results have been interpreted as probably not but how is that true for any other scientific theory to your main question there is a big difference religion is believing because you want to believe without any form of testing without any critical thinking without willingness to accept any other truth theoretical science on the other hand is about trying to come up with theories to explain the universe and then figuring out ways to test it prove it or disprove it and if you can disprove it come up with a new theory it thrives on critical thinking it searches for tests and it mandates being willing to drop it if it has been found wrong no scientist ever said i wanna believe in string theory because it makes me feel cozy and warm or because thats what the scriptures my parents hammered into my head as a child said they say i think string theory could explain the universe so lets try to figure out if its correct and how well we can apply it to our world if it turns out wrong thats also fine because then we are just one step closer to finding out the real way it works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the main goal of mainstream science is to use facts to prove how things work the main goal of mainstream religion is to use hopes and fears to influence how people think when you step outside the mainstream the goals reverse while the methods stay the same could science lead to proving a religion correct absolutely many scientists are religious afterall that isnt a goal per se but a potential outcome none the less
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think people are missing the main point im trying to make here and the target key word being theoretical scienceas in not proven true at all using math to only kinda prove illusions of grandeur is not very far from people using what they think they see and feel to prove their own illusions of grandeur themselves the motives being different is also moderately irrelevant because guess what neither side can prove any of it and furthermore my other point being that many of these theories actually reinforce religious thoughts in some form or another
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mtheory and the simulation theory are classified as scientific theories however and scientists continue to take much time effort and money to attempt to prove these theories with experiment after experiment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i only gave you two examples and only delved into one of them to say i dont make any sense and to then tell me why i dont make sense tells me you lack imagination andor an open mind im not saying you do but youre not giving me much of a chance to explain my thoughts which makes it harder to listen to yours to be fair i did also say religious aspects not in their entirety necessarily but for instance another example if for mtheory you accept that one to be real then you should accept the likelihood that some alternate universes contain laws of physics that completely contradict the known laws of physics in our universe from there it doesnt take a genius to think that if physical laws can be different in another universe then pretty much anything is possible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,s to use facts to prove how things work the main goal of mainstream religion is to use hopes and fears to influence how people think when you step outside the mainstream the goals reverse while the methods stay the same could science lead to proving a religion correct absolutely many scientists are religious afterall that isnt a goal per se but a potential outcome none the less but not bloody likely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if for mtheory you accept that one to be real then you should accept the likelihood that some alternate universes contain laws of physics that completely contradict the known laws of physics in our universe from there it doesnt take a genius to think that if physical laws can be different in another universe then pretty much anything is possible even if that were the case how would that affect our universe so maybe batman exists in another universe but that doesnt mean he exists in ours or created ours and again how do these examples reflect on a whole how does for example general relativity provea god exists the way you phrased it you said that in general a scientific theory proven right proves a god to say i dont make any sense and to then tell me why i dont make sense tells me you lack imagination andor an open mind see and thats the difference between science and religion if you tell a scientist why they dont make sense theyll reevaluate what they said evaluate my explanation and then either accept that they were wrong or elaborate why my rebuttal was wrong if you tell a religious person why they dont make sense theyll never accept it say you lack an open mind and then shut their ears to everything you said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because now spillage could become a concern quantum physics suggests parallel universe interact and influence each other i think you give too much credit to scientists in general to not get lost and caught up in their own work they can be pretty stubborn too furthermore scientists require quite an imagination to come up with this stuff in any event im not trying to be stubborn myself i actually did read everything you wrote even if i hinted at your comment making me do otherwise all im really saying is where do you draw the line from reality and science fiction
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and fantastic beats and where to find them will be the name of my next 🔥🔥🔥 mixtape azkaban doesnt have half this many bars

Showerthoughts,not_removed,the same could be said sadly for people who are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hows that sad people get married younger than that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,getting married at is a far cry from doing porn at there are many beautiful reasons why people at get married if they are doing porn at they are being exploited
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are people getting arranged marriages before and alot of girls still would take that risk if they had a chance at making some fast cash i thought you meant underage sex in general was wrong my bad lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do not find this bit of information interesting in the slightest thank you for sharing this bit of information
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you reached too far bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i read that weve only recently started seeing colors for instance that last color we learned to recognize was blue history books and older art is blue absent of verbiage and blues and replaced with greens and purples for the sea and the sky for instance go far enough back and we only saw black and whitelike dogs who knows maybe one day well see colors like ultra violet and infra red
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone identified colors and named them accordingly fact that someone was not me so maybe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are colors some other species can see that we cant its crazy to think about we cant even imagine these colors because to us they dont exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to some extent we cant see ultraviolet for example

Showerthoughts,not_removed,that sounds like a good plan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gap year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,love that quote im not saying im unhappy more like a thirst of not losing oneself in a mediocre crazy day to day life so a little change can help it was just a thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres something called lucid dreaming
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know what you mean its the fucking primal call of the wild but sometimes changing the little things is changing the biggest things of all its hard to balance but those are the things that keep you human
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what i cant hear you is a deaf sentence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do the same i just tick the box that says
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah no you havent people who are sometimes actually do lose count or stop caring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol ikr
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha good one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like people use lol for sarcasmor when they actually laugh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,anyone could technically be a philosopher a person who has never come in contact with another human being could be as wise as somebody with a degree in philosophy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you dont trust in the credibility or worth of your thoughts how would you trust your mind enough to wax philosophical it seems more to me like theyd try to avoid it for fear of sounding unintelligent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then tell me this what is philosophy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a metastudy on knowledge the paradox lies in the fact that hed be conscious of things of that level but for fearuncertainty prevent himself from making certain observation that is to beg the question can a censored thought truly be philosophical if you censored yourself itd be well within the realm of safety in terms of thought which would moreless liken it to that of a scientific observaton
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the tooth scary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt you invest the money you got from the tooth fairy like we all did thats how we get free dental care later in life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,top fucking drawer right there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or crush on the teenagers and feel like a creep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jared probably liked rewatching his old subway commercials
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this also rewatching gilmore girls jared padalecki and milo ventimiglia are fiiiiiiine but damned if it doesnt feel wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gilmore girls at the moment finding chris the father extremely attractive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,corny but ill upvote it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and if you say something wrong and put your foot in your mouth while on a date you might never get to put her foot in your mouth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must think a lot of pauly shore then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is there a general dislike of franco i thought people either liked him or were just ambivalent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he lost his cool for me when he was performing a satanic ritual at a college something like babylon working as art hey im an atheist as the next but seeing that and his movie this is the end made me think hes probably crazy as shit off camera
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell yeah he is that sexy mofo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats called taking for granted that you usually do know the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck you even talking about man convergence and divergence of infinite series dont work like that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,george is also younger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fantasy dwarves or real dwarfs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think they prefer little people or half man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but oh those beardcare products are expensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a family they actually spend about the same amount because they need to make seven portions its ok im allowed to joke about dwarves they look up to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is this the real dwarfs or is this fantasy dwarves caught in a landslide no escape from reality gimli mercury
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was thinking real life usually people get mad if you say midgets so i went with dwarves plus in every movie ive seen they slam food back like nobody else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shine a torch on it and itll be a lighter lighter lighter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it smells like your light saber in this post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is way funnier then it should be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no one does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,welcome to your
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lpt for get a profession with wide recognition declare regret didnt do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was thinking this exact thing the other day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that sounds about right even if you knew youll change your mind a bunch of time from now until you die anyway its fine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im going on in a few months i didnt figure out what i wanted to do until i turned and it took my until to realize it there is so much pressure on kids these days to pick a clear and defined career path at years old dump a ridiculous amount of money into college for it and stick with it for life that is just not realistic it works some of the time but most people who follow this direction end up miserable try a few different jobs see if anything sticks if you want some college then only do the general courses right now to get them out of the way my job progression by age life guard janitor laser quest marshall best buy sales rep laser quest assistant manager comcast cable guy security alarm installer commercial low voltage technician started my own security alarmlow voltage business going strong with a decent customer base growing from someone whos been there and felt directionless throughout his dont sweat it you got this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate sweet potatoes but i love pumpkin pie and cant tell the difference between sweet potato pie and pumpkin pie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and chicken and eggs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve never had a chicken lettuce and mayo sandwich youre totally missing out on one of lifes simple pleasures
Showerthoughts,not_removed,zymurgy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that explains the taste
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this could make a great writing prompt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think it depends on whose rules you use in earlier stories you needed a silver bullet to kill a werewolf but there was nothing saying that silver would be harmful to touch just as a vampire could carry a wooden stake and as long as its not plunged into his heart hes fine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,could also try out some simple bondage on the night of a full moon might take her a few minutes to chew through some leather and a gag by then you could be miles away in your car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if they didnt they do now well done letting this idea loose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg me too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wut
Showerthoughts,not_removed,k
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg an echo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its like op set up some sort of room
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or chamber
Showerthoughts,not_removed,circular in nature
Showerthoughts,not_removed,free apple pi for anyone who joins the jerk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do you mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we say oh ill do it tomorrow as if its guaranteed but unfortunately its not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most of the stuff well do tomorrow isnt important enough that it will be a big deal that we didnt do it if we die today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know but its just the fact that we push things off even tho we could die any moment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder if the people attending his funeral would get rick rolled
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hopefully he puts something in his will to rick roll the attendees at his funeral
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go fuck yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think rick astley would so far that he would tell his funeral attendees to go fuck themselves totally antirickrolling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the wrong place for this post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plot twist op has never been married edit op after looking through your post history please seek help from a licensed psychologist or mft on your own before getting back with this guy like seriously you got some shit you need to workout first
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hope you wont be dating anyone else while your ex is around since youre clearly going to fuck him again in the future
Showerthoughts,not_removed,than why is he ex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ex husband
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how is this a shower thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im i stand i the shower thinking about this where is the correct destination
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well duh thats why we are happily just being friends and terrified of getting back together weve both done a ton of work on ourselves which is why i think were even able to have such a nice relationship
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we are so weird we keep trying but were both too traumatized by each other we are a very happy functional family so either way yay and im not not way too confusing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because he was a horrible abusive drug addict but hes been sober for three years so im starting to warm up a bit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at this point we definitely are more and more into each other but were both being very cautious which i think is great we have a nice little unusual family and dont want to shake it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,trust me i left him for a good reason but hes definitely gone way out of his way to make amends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a lot of back story i have very valid reasons for leaving
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because who the fuck knows what kind of thought it is i considered stoner thoughts but meh its random ie shower thought i stand in the shower pondering this often
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are a very literal person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is nice to hear he is changing whether its for your kids you or even himself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds more like a showerhead thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly whether or not i get back together with him its so nice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its development is arrested if you will
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is never not a want for donuts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but you only have to pay one of two employees at a time so thats nice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do nut knock till you try it lololol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,volumeif you make a dollar a doughnut or bucks a dozen and sell a day seven days a week you make over and you are your own boss and have all the doughnuts tu can eat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he died in years im not sure how mind blown hed be actually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,considering how many fire ants i killed in benning i doubt it theyre out for revenge
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we sleep because were tired
Showerthoughts,not_removed,better yet whats the closest youve been to being a victim of a murderer or molester oo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive shaken hands with a man who threatened to hang a woman after he raped her she managed to escape i didnt want to shake his hand but he was being introduced as a new and wonderful family member and i didnt think fast enough to refuse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,close enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so this is why my tounge gets rock hard when im about to eat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,webmd says that sounds like cancer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,incognito baby
Showerthoughts,not_removed,new phone saves my incognito windows really need to fix that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have adhd you just described my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ya like you diethats itcrazy eh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if its not it what if there is more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is so many different things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hot dogs used to do this in the if i recall correctly bun packs and dog packs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this happens with chips and salsa for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a sick cycle until i eventually just start using it on toast or in macaroni and cheese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to make coke floats like that run out of ice cream add more ice cream get low on coke add more coke continue all afternoon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just use a spoon my dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,solution just eat cream cheese by itself preferbly strawberry flavored
Showerthoughts,not_removed,use the cream cheese for other things like making cheese cake break the cycle man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,break the cycle of your impending doom and consume kiwi fruits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im locked in the hummus and pitta bread cycle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i run into this same exact problem with cereal and milk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about chives and smoked salmon dont you need them with your bagels
Showerthoughts,not_removed,garden veggie cream cheese tastes great in mashed potatoes just saying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do the same with chips and salsa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first world problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the never ending cycle of bagel and cream cheese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like the issue is less of a lack of certain foodstuffs and more lack of creativity so many ways you can use cream cheese cheesecake spread it on toast with jam mix with tuna for tuna quesadillasman i love cream cheese as for bagels eh put jam on em i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love bagels and cream cheese what do you say i come over and help you out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aint life a bitch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,finish the cream cheese off with crackers then finish the crackers off alone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im in the same cycle but with cheese spread and crackers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the exact situation with chips cheese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,buy some tortillas and make wraps with the cream cheese perfect way to use extra cream cheese
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my wife is a baker who bakes bagels i am in a constant struggle to buy enough cream cheese to keep up with the bagels
Showerthoughts,not_removed,packs of buns and packs of dogs and youve got each boom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought this was a myth perpetuated by pop culture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh chips and salsa is a staple snack in my house so this isnt a problem either way plain chips are better than a friendless wad of salsa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn beat me to it had the url copied and everything then decided to scroll down and make sure no one posted it first
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in macaroni and cheese you animal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont see the issue here p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats fucked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relatable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he never said this was a problem lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtheydidthemath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,packs of buns packs of dogs ÷ the expiry time for the bread dogs in days cholesterolheart attacks boom boom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was a cream cheese smash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtheydidthemonstermath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,learn to metabolise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have to try it what is your cream chease to norm chease ratio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he did the math it caught on in a flash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rthemonstermath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt realize until just now that thats a reference to that song
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha id kill to have your metabolism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ritwasamathclasssmash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is a great show called how the states got their shapes or something i watched it was fun and super explanatory willam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rivers mountains etc etc etc have to keep writing or get a stupid robot response but the answer is rivers almost exclusively
Showerthoughts,not_removed,couple of reasons natural borders water mountains etc previous landowners property boundaries minormajor border disputes over small chunks that end up deforming the shape even further
Showerthoughts,not_removed,must check this out thanks for the hot tip willam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats an easy one because if all borders were circles then there would be tones of space between them if they dont overlap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what subs have you been visiting ill agree with you on the part about movies because rmovies can be horrible at times but being politically correct is not the favorite of reddit people just expect others to act like you would in a face to face conversation this isnt facebook dont call someone a needle dick just because you disagree with them present your side of the argument you dont have to be politically correct but dont be an asshole to other redditors just because you can also dont make yourself an easy target for trolls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must be a stranger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt this what tumblr is notorius for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fishing for downvotes or never left the front page
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pussy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wasnt calling you an asshole i was simply saying dont be an asshole as a generalized statement not targeted at any specific individual also your comment on the picture has upvotes looking through your profile the problem isnt reddit the problem is you take things way too personal you start going off about political correctness at times where it wasnt even relevant to the conversation you were offended by things that you shouldnt have been offended by and you almost always made personal attacks if you stay on topic and browse through the new section of different subs youll see upvotes flow in this is my third account deleted the others because i wanted a new username its a little over a month old and already at yes there has been some posts where you were an asshole for seemly no reason hell i even made a post about how ive become apethic to homeless and it was upvoted because i stayed on topic and wasnt a total dick about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont fall for the trolls trap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good job proving my point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh my goddude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was literally posted less than an hour ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you do realize that it would take infinity for the human lifespan to be infinity right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op loves cock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op made a nerdy nerd surprised op is a magician
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no zero wouldnt cancel out infinity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you wouldnt know they were immortal until they didnt die
Showerthoughts,not_removed,very magician maybe they are the immortal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you divide by it it might
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait that means i could be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then the human lifespan wouldnt be infinity until they live to infinity which is what i said earlier
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it wouldnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first of all there arent secondly even if there would then wed have to divide infinity by infinity which just doesnt work even in the hyperreal numbers you would be talking about two different infinities here and cant calculate it unless you know in advance how exactly they are different so even if someone would have lived infinitely many years then there could be for example half as many aborted fetuses and it would still be infinite a half of infinity is another infinity and the average would be never would it be though a division never returns unless the dividend is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first of all infinity is not a real number so you cant calculate with it if we do allow infinity as a number which is a concept in the hyperreal numbers infinity divided by a number is still infinity its a different infinity but it still is infinity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get back in line with the rest of us mortals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was curious httpwwwphilforhumanitycomzerotimesinfinityhtml for anyone wondering
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first of all you havent seen my basement secondly math math math math math
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im aware i took equal parts mathematics and chemistry during my college coursework i was making a joke lighten up buddy protip you also cant divide by zero that would be the joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why multiply
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your joke didnt make sense how was i supposed to assume from your comment that in order to calculate the average you wanted to divide by the value you want to average and not the count
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by having the ability to understand social interactions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah right you say something nonsensical and everyone else is at fault for not getting what you actually meant i should have just assumed you wanted to say the wrong thing and not the slightly less wrong thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is correct
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats normal for the spider is utter hell for the fly for all we know this could be the case but from our perspective we cant know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your title is a disease
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you high
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know of no infection with the free will or the appearance thereof to choose whether to help or harm its host so yall can stop with the metaphor now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was once too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the whole universe maybe not the moon sure likes earth though d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you seem conceited opinionated and critical of others you have all the right qualities
Showerthoughts,not_removed,runon but good insight a
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right now every girl in arizona is pretty hot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,asian girls are some of the girls i think are the absolute ugliest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,enh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like black girls better dat booty tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same here there are a few that are decent by of the time theyre fugly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the only ones that are hot are mixed like white asian cant do edit besides these korean girls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for that no sleep for me tonight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats about ten times the minimum wage somebody on the other end of the scale is making bank
Showerthoughts,not_removed,source
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget that you will be taxed for approximately of that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a painful way to look at the separation of the classes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpwwwtheglobalistcomthecostofahumanlifestatisticallyspeaking put the value of a human life between seven and nine million dollars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i had a dollar for every repost i saw women would find me attractive also
Showerthoughts,not_removed,definitely man did you see the football game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,routside
Showerthoughts,not_removed,buy a cow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,portait mode ftw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why if you are talking about you must hate this world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,being in the film industry i cant stand to see things in portrait
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lpt aim next to the handle when kicking down a door
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hodor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if all you have is a hammer everything is a nail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every book is a childrens book if the kid can read
Showerthoughts,not_removed,spoken like that guy who never sees the pull sign until after having run into the door at least once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lpt sub addition dont lock your knee get a bit closer to the door and lean into the kick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,crying out loud
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jesus thats deep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know a guy who had several plants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the hell this is like the third time this week ive seen this posted here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure we can halflife aint happening in a way that will please the fans if at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you prime example perpetual motion with a positive production of energy will never happen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you find the blue lagoon as risque take a gander at brooke shields in pretty baby that movie caused a lot of controversy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,deleted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would be great because i prefer the very back anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as theaters with assigned seats this is generally how its done
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was stuck on the side which not only distorted my view of the screen but meant the sound was distorted as it bounced off the wall
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and what might you two be doing back there hmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,steve walsh has done a lot of great things all dads want to meet him and many sons carry on due to some goddamn amazing advice he gave one time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think wed actually pose any kind of threat to them though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i genuinely want to find a video of this analogy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bears may also pose a problem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the good news is that lions and tigers will probably kill and eat you long before those feline allergies kick in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wild animals tend to have different hair dander composition so it probably would not be an issue also tigers and lions would eat you before you would notice any allergic reaction
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stay away from the stadium district in detroit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i figured as much i was thinking about how awesome if my cat was the size of a tiger and then i realized my allergies would probably make it difficult to hang with her if she was big then i thought about real tigers and lions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really they dont work in cars and real nerds dont go outdoors so theyre kinda useless i had em for a couple years but didnt get them the next time around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i work in optical and cringe every time someone below the age of wants them especially when parents make their kids get them yikes that kid is getting bullied
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell they dont work in the cold either or too well i should say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thought this comment was going to say transitions made it easierless strain on the eyes or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im always too focused on holding in my farts to really pay attention to the ads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah because you know everyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe get a new doctor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go to a different doctor then pretty simple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol so you want him to listen when you go into your symptoms involving a region that someone else is trained better in to diagnose ie a specialist if you want to believe that a few google searches is better then go ahead but i think you wont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the condition is called heterochromia it was cause by the damaging of the muscles that control the pupil of his left eye after he took a punch from a friend when he was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not that old sophomore in college but yeah i still remember some stuff from back then faces random interactions maybe conversations but not names im really bad with names
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in our classroom we had little rubber models in baskets for some reason i think they were part of an activity to demonstrate the phonetics of the objects names in one basket there was an eraser and since there were quite a few young kids who would use it often it was written on and probably accidentally used to erase things one day i distinctly remember walking by my teachers desk as she was scrubbing at the model eraser with her own eraser i barely heard her mutter can you erase an eraser i have absolutely no idea why thats stuck with me all these years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i slipped a piece of paper into a girls bin during class it had a crudely drawn heart on it i cant remember if it was kim steinke or heather mcmahon i do remember that they put it back in my bin and never said anything about it oh well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably the latter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont underestimate your grandpas pornhub game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,real life boobs are different to photomovie boobs tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless they were the mongols
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless your ancestor was genghis khan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt be so sure cave men and women fucked everyone constantly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,given the hundreds of thousands of years of humanlike beings who rarely covered their breasts i seriously doubt thats true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which he statistically was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dammmmmmiiiit im keeping it anyways i hate this interweb thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt it always basically cleaning a table
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre watching the game in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought about it in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the new player generation who saw lebron teaming up with wade and bosh and thought hey things are easier this way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where else do you masturbate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lpt put your hand out when they have the coins in their hand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a cashier i hate when customers put the cash or card on the counter instead of my outstreatched hand or when they decide to hand me crumpled up cash so rude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate when they give you your change back and start ringing the next person so your anxiety kicks in because you feel in the way as you are trying to put the coins and the bills in the proper spot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a cashier i would never put the change on the counter i hate when customers do and i have to awkwardly slide it into my hand and then put it in the till
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate when someone scoops ice cream into a bowl puts the spoon in their mouth to get off what the excess leftover on the spoon and then puts the spoon back into the ice cream as if they didnt just put their slobber all over it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt you say this grinds your gears
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id gladly slide the change across the counter as long as there isnt a damn receipt with it i hate when they give you the receipt no matter what you purchase
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this post gave me anxiety attacks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if some crumpled cash is all they have and are trying to feed their family while finding a job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uncrumple that shit or im gonna start handing you back crumpled cash and throwing your change on the floor behind you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres no way you just realized this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is so cute reminds me of a time i was living in rural australia i was hearing noises one night like someone trying to open a window i leap t out of bed shone a torch outside and couldnt see a thing i then adjusted my focus to discover a phascogale clinging to the screen it was scampering about catching insects a privelaged rare sighting not a bugbut wownot an intruder either this is what a phascogale looks like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow that is up there on my list of ten cute animals now thank you for that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah now when i hear a noise at night i go looking expecting to find something cool a frog owl cat dog who knows hope its never an intruder though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fortunately real life doesnt work that way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how bout no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that a sentence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,death goes not heal or help our energy levels to recover so sleep is nothing like death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no that is sleep this is his brain on sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let me break it down for your simple mind a good nights sleep is measured by how much of it we arent awake for which is essentially being dead maybe a comma after for would have helped you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or maybe a sub genre kind of like metal thrash death hardcore posthardcore etc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agreed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah it is its called trap rap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i meant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oooooh well in that case i agree with you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doesnt work well if the section title is a common phrase or word

Showerthoughts,not_removed,zombies dont exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,christmas is an important date for many pagan cultures who celebrate midwinter there are stoneage monuments aligned with the sun on midwinter solstice people have been celebrating the birth of the sun thousands of years before christianity called it the birth of gods son
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the upside of being smart is that you actually know how most things work including how religion is a method of control over dumb people the downside of being smart is that you have to constantly deal with dumb people and thats very tiring
Showerthoughts,not_removed,should of posted this under ratheistsweakattemptatdefacingreligion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,honestly christ only suffered three piercing cuts and a stab wound the medicine at the time would have allowed him to be stitched up and brought back he only suffered on the cross for three days his legs werent broken so he could have came back after three days the important thing is that he challenged the jews and their laws because they werent living according to the covenant of moses and his ten commandments the jews as always have been persecuted for choosing to free a barbarian over an innocent man the bible was written three hundred years after christ died so if course some shit will be made up but the core principles and tenets remain you reap what you sow and using religion as a means and form of profit is ungodly a true disciple of christ finds ways to spread his message without charging people christianity accomplished a great deal if good by turning barbarians into people that worked together for a common purpose heaven or hell i dont care anymore i gave my possessions in and and the world still hasnt changed i chose to follow in christs footsteps and if anything it made me fearless of death and the world because if heaven does exist i have a spot ready but if it doesnt i will enjoy valhalla on earth europe will be lost to the muslims and america has so many preachers and religions that it makes me sick work six days a week and preach from the pulpit on the seventh any jackass can read the bible but few obey its tenets both old and new the quran just copies and pastes the bible in order to fit its arabic roots but whereas we convert pagans with baptism and sacrifice the quran converts its followers with taxes and blood islam isnt peace its an invasion of freedom and free expression the muslims are years behind us they are living in the dark ages
Showerthoughts,not_removed,athiest hate admitting that being an atheist requires faith in the unknown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow a snarky atheist am one myself look wether or not you believe in something is great its our choice but we have to respect everyone and what they believe might differ from what we believe we all see homeless people ranting to themselves but we dont point and laugh and if you do your probably a sociopath thanks buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are sure to get far in life with that attitude youll figure it out buddy when you grow up its being a member of society curious so when you go out to eat the waiter has to gain your respect for you to treat him politely when you see someones tire blown out on the road you wouldnt stop because what have they ever done for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in what way is this edgy im genuinely curious last time i checked edgy is reaper from overwatch and whathaveyou op clearly isnt some neckbeard from ratheism and he doesnt appear to be trying to troll christians its almost like he had some kind of odd observation a thought if you will in his shower

Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh wow thats a bit of a stretch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you do thoughjudging a religion over their beliefs now that youre believing in a religion makes it worse because close to all religions have a messiahof sorts nowthat youre making fun of a messiah from abother religion is kind of stupid i am saying im muslim for the idiots thinking id be a hardcore christian defending his religion with his life

Showerthoughts,not_removed,falling with style
Showerthoughts,not_removed,calling jesusthe son of god a zombiea fictional creation is making fun of him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because you have the mindset of a kid who only regurgitates what he sees on his edgy facebook feed incase that wasnt obvious to you already and im saying this as an entirely unreligious person your point of view arguments comments are all extremely misguided superficial and downright immature id suggest talking to people outside of and expanding your bubble dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,something that doesnt exist in real life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is a mo at my corner store he chill af he even teaches me arabic

Showerthoughts,not_removed,false the ocean water is ofter colder than ice because there is a significant amount of salt in it which lowers the freezing temperature
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you were the tattletale in school huh

Showerthoughts,not_removed,so much misconception what everyone needs to realize is that this is a problem with dental insurance companies not dentists guess how much money dental insurance would reimburse you decades ago guess how much money dental insurance will reimburse you as of most of them are still in that many years they havent adjusted how much they would cover which means that the patient benefits less and less my office is ppo which means it doesnt matter if i charge for a crown or million the insurance company either way will say eh well your contracted rate is x amount so thats what you get and y is what your patient will owe most of the large dental insurance companies met life and delta for example have a zero negotiation policy so until someone comes along and forces them to raise your benefits then dentists and the patient gets screwed there is also a ton of fine print that patients dont understand such as the ability for the insurance company to not honor their word did you get an explanation of benefits that say you only owe for a four tooth bridge wellnow that you got it done theyve downgraded that to a partial and you now owe the dentists totally legal mix into this that i was in school taking up to forty credit hours a semester until i was years old to be able to do this i lost all of my twenties listen there will always be people in every profession trying to screw you dental isnt magically different just understand that many times we dont get to make or negotiate our own costs especially if we are in network and at the very end of it yes we do want to live a decent life since we sacrificed so much to begin with my grandfather was a dentist my mother and father are both dentists so is my sister most of my friends are dentists never once in my life even in a joking manner have i heard any of them comment about how they get to screw patients over how they get to make a ton of money off their patients how they can immediately buy a boat the reason you go into dentistry is because you like to work with your hands you dont want to stare at a computer screen in a cubicle all day but instead walk around and talk to and joke with dozens of people everyday like to build but also like art dentistry good at explaining things in a concise manner but also like surgery and medicine dentistry want to be a doctor but dont want to be as screwed as american medical doctors have felt lately dentistry work with your hands make a decent paycheck dont work or days a week help people out that are in most cases extremely grateful for your services especially if youre a gentle dentist hopefully now you all are understanding and this speaks nothing of how truly stressful and back breaking it can be thats a whole different conversation source dentist with residency training in iv sedation implants and surgery
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they are working together where do you think the tooth fairy gets the money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know this is somewhat of a joke post but i know three people ranging from to that have neglected the dentist even when they had the funds to go that have had to undergo full teeth removal and implants or dentures all of them have said they dont like any part of it it messes with speech enjoying food like apples or steak and self esteem we all have problems to deal with but seriously take the time to make it a habit to brush and floss and check up with the dentist if you have the funds or insurance to do so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,outside bones outside bonesnever forget your teeth are outside bones edit

Showerthoughts,not_removed,a dentist friend of mine is quite uhm flamboyant he will always be the tooth fairy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you see there if only you had invested that when you were a child you would have now to pay the dentist thru the magic of compound interest but noooooo you had to spend it on candy all of your problems are caused by your profligate nature and inability to plan ahead for the future

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always thought it must be really shitty for kids whose parents are literally scavenging the couch for enough change for that nights dinner and didnt get visits by the tooth fairy or santa but had to hear stories about how their friends did some kids must have thought that the tooth fairy didnt like them or that they were really naughty 😔 i love stories about how parents like this make it work by handmaking toys and such warms my little black heart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoa whoa so this man dressed in white is bad because he takes an amount of money you deem worth more than a tooth granted but the little faerie that comes in the night when you are and has this fucked up thing where she has to get the tooth from under your pillow all the while you are sleeping at night
Showerthoughts,not_removed,indian here every time i gripe about the rising cost of living not able to buy world class electronics without paying ridiculous amount for import duty etc i remind myself about the ultra cheap and very good btw local medical services and it immediately calms me down for root canal wtf you can get it done here for max the same is true for almost any other medical procedure at least in this area us needs to put its shit together soon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i lost a tooth as a child the tooth fairy brought me a pound when i lose a tooth as an adult the costs are covered for me as i live in a civilised country that wouldnt see me suffer financial hardship over something essential
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just got done spending on implants a crown and replacing some old fillings i had to get the crown because that tooth was next to one of my implants and due to its size the doc needed to make some room for the implant or rather the abutment i had to replace the fillings because the previous dentist didnt do a good job of cleaning out all of the decay which is also precisely the reason that ultimately led to me getting the two implants as s child i neglected taking care of my teeth didnt have much parental oversight either i assure you that my unborn daughter upon her arrival will meticulously brush floss and use mouth wash a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never forget your teeth are outside bones theyre bones that you wash and when youre a kid they fall from your head and to make things less weird we say they got stolen from a demon that your parents know

Showerthoughts,not_removed,it costs to remove a tooth here and for the wisdom tooth but i am not telling you where or ill have to build a wall
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just for you guys that think you are getting it cheap as a future dentist with a dentist father and a dental technician mother i can say that getting a low cost dentist that graduated from some eastern european university with all respect the standards there are low you will face many problems specially in your midlate also worse if you smoke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait a minute i seriously cant relate normal teeth work is free and if you want a white fancy filling its € damn son is a real number or not real at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,god bless america
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wisdoms teeth plus nitrous cost me dollars get on that double insurance game brah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont get it because free health care
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats inflation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dentists are the biggest thieves on the planet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow this is the dumbest most rforwardsfromgrandma post i have ever seen on this sub is this what counts for content nowadays are you fucking serious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a crown years ago it cost me today that crown cracked and i was quoted to fix it i think the tooth fairy is collecting all those dollars back with interest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every dentist i know works part time has multiple investment properties and a luxury boat they are the modern day equivalents of a highway robber
Showerthoughts,not_removed,check out a dentistry school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,check to see if you have a dental school near you ask for a graduate student to work on you if nervous costs more but either way they are always closely supervised and have lots of lab practice should cost about half of what a dental office would charge and the students usually have the latest equipment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wish parents were more informed with these things i never realized i should have teeth savings bonds stemming from each tooth fairy visit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nhs is all im saying under and the poor get free dental
Showerthoughts,not_removed,today that crown cracked and i was quoted to fix it thats a pretty high cost ceiling highcost threshold or whatever they call it in your country
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel you got a crown years ago cost me well over €
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats alot of interest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stop your money or your teeth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hah i get free health care
Showerthoughts,not_removed,considering the lab fees and multiple dental visits is a steal maybe thats why it only lasted years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just do what everyone else is doing go to mexico or canada its wayyyy cheeper there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are paying too much for a crown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i checked in aus and it would cost to get two crowns to fix my teeth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so like where is this dentist at in la
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does this dentist really exist address pls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we need this dentist information man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that dentist is worth it make sure you treat them right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a guy here in my city that i wished was findable he did a lot of good samaritan work for poor people and in his office instead of wallpaper he had all these letters he had written to the ada about having to fix other dentists shitty work he retired and something happened where he went bankrupt and had to live in a hotel people were still coming to him asking desperately for his help he would autoclave his tools right there and do the work in the room from what i hear none of the people who went to him for this clandestine work ever had a problem such as infection my husband was one of them before we met the guy pulled out a problem molar thats roots were all twisted in with another tooth husband says he lay back with his head off the bed and the dentist pulled that tooth out the easiest and quickest hes ever had a tooth out before the dentist got arrested and his license taken away at court despite the fact that more than people showed up and signed a petition to let him practice again or at least not punish him he still spent months in jail and then right after he got out he died rest peacefully dr there are not many like you and you will be missed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like a great dentist might go check him out thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow so good awesome story
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a tooth demon in training and that hurt me too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have dental insurance it changed the price from to im soooooo glad im insured
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its better than my job which only covers dental tooth demon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lisa needs braces
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its £ stop trying to make people thing its cheap here that extra £ is a lot of money you know its a whole waitrose sandwich worth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hadnt been to the dentist in about a decade yes stupid i went and had to have fillings and a tooth pulled and it cost me £ god bless the nhs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,british expat in inida here i had a wisdom tooth removed for rupees thats about £
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fixing a crown is a tier treatment £
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats for band treatments if were talking about the crown that op is getting replaced itll most likely be a band £ treatment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell im in the uk attending a private dentist and it doesnt cost nearly the us rates
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i saw a brit on a sat night for an emergency he was on holiday in the states well he needed a tooth pulled so i quoted him a couple hundred bucks he goes on and on about how in the nhs it would be ten dollars cool whatever its sat night i came in for you and ten dollars is how much you are paying for a drink at the hotel bar i then tell him he has another broken tooth that should be pulled it went exactly like this your other tooth needs to come out i had that pulled already yes but it is in there broken off and needs to come out sure but it only cost me ten dollars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean you pay for dentists in most countries even those with free healthcare
Showerthoughts,not_removed,canadian here free healthcare only cover children dentalwise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think people are saying something else here health care in the us and this includes dental care is fucked up for reasons and you addressed only one yes the insurance companies are screwing it up majorly thats a very well known fact but the other problem is that the base prices themselves are also outrageous multiple orders of magnitude higher than in other developed countries canada all eu countries australia those two things are actually connected of course they are not two separate problems but they both need to be addressed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,👆🏻 this guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep when my grandma was in her late early she got all of her teeth removed and refused to wear dentures her niece got all of her teeth removed and replaced with implants in her my mom had her bottom molars removed in her im scared for what the future might bring but i take care of my teeth so hopefully wont go through this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know some people who practically never go to the dentist and dont brush their teeth often and never floss and their teeth like fine and they say they never have pain i think genetics and diet probably change the kind of mileage different people can expect from their teeth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lion hunting trips are expensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aetna an insurance company here in the us the ceo makes like million plus millions in bonuses a year my families policy is weekly with a dollar deductible before insurance kicks in at reason is my first sentence edit to clarify thats health insurance dental insurance is also a rip off and vision insurance and for fun you can buy more insurance to save on deductibles i have opted to take modified pay higher pay no benefits and if we get sick at least i made more i cant afford grand in case something catastrophic happens even with what the insurance would pay i still couldnt make the deductible and copay so it would be bankruptcy either way so why waste the cash so lucky non americans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im going to try and give an answer with more depth than just corruption i am european but ive taken classes in comparative labour studies and social security labour and wellfare there are multiple reasons why healthcare in the us is so much more expensive one might be more corruption this i know little about but the thing is that in the us overhead costs comprise a much much larger percentage of the overall cost than in european nations centralisation means that there is less overhead cost accounting legal work all of it needs to be done in every individual organisation in the us while in many european nations these costs are much lower because they are centralised furthermore there is the legal costs it is much easier in the us to sue for negligence and what not the us has out of the top of my head times the number off lawyers per capita than in my county the netherlands doctors hospitals all of it need more money for legal fees lastly healthcare is much more the subject to market principles in the us normal supply and demand doesnt work in establishing proper prices in healthcare this is because you cant choose to just not buy the product it isnt a luxury item you need it so you have no option but to pay for it therefore the sector can charge whatever the hell they want because what are you going to do just die because the price is too high all of this is from the top of my head so the details might be a bit fuzzy but essentially this is a large part of the price difference in healthcare between completely liberal markets like the us and more controlled markets in the eu
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpdentistryusceduprogramsddscostofattendance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hi dentist here you dont want to hear the answer but ill tell you i went to school a long time to learn how to do a very specific thing if you are in it and are the only one who knows how to do a specific type of whatever you charge for it and i make a million dollars a year but it costs me to keep my doors open i pay people full time and i owe a ton to the bank and if we ever make a mistake it costs and years of heartache whatever job you have do you ever make mistakes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in most european countries you arent insured for dental care by default it usually costs a bit extra
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how is state provided healthcare socialized healthcare if it were socialized healthcare there would be a direct or representative democratic process workplace democracy within the healthcare service to manage its functions that would be separate from the state state healthcare does not have such functions which means that the state controls the service thus making it fascist or neofascist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im changing my business cards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,came here to say exactly that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep i had that done last year insurance delta covered zero thet do however cover the follow up checkups on the implant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what magical land do you live an implant surgery plus the implant can come out to like and most insurance companies will tell you to screw yourself before they will cover it p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i recently had teeth removed by a dental surgeon in brisbane for a bit under grand he was super quick and reasonably painless too its insane how much it can vary teeth out in thailand for about dollars a tooth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why dont you take them out yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can still pay around £ for it with the nhs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly whats in real money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive literally been watching my dad do free extractions in texas since i was ten everybody does cheap extractions if not free because its the only life saving procedure in dentistry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats going on my business card anon dmd the tooth demon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get a crown if that root canal cracks youre gonna have to get an implant get a crown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and then you have a big nasty gap p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you sob you tell me now mexican juan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its unfortunate that you have that perception of us most of us are good honest people who want the best for your mouth the cost is due to over head and our student loans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i graduate i will be in debt and probably working for a corporate dental office the dentist you are describing sounds like some one who had few loans coming out and inherited a practice i wish that was me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dad is a dentist he definitely doesnt have multiple investment properties and doesnt work part time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dental caries is the disease in the world and the most preventable with the exception of a minority of cases proper diet and oral hygiene will ensure very little expenditures for dental health highway robber seems harsh i am still over is student loan debt work days a week over hrs a week the dentists you describe sound like unicorns to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpdentistryusceduprogramsddscostofattendance probably not the recent grads if they had to lay for school themselves the guys that went to school in the had no competition and no debt but were able to work through the biggest boom in dentistry new grads not so much its more competitive than med school and insanely expensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,got teeth doesnt matter well make you a copay anyway we have shit for everyone to spend money on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea but being a dentist sucks you have to stare into mouths all day of people who hate you and youre forced to inflict pain upon them they pay them so much so they wont kill themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with the highest rate of suicide in medical professions im told though this may be a myth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a dentist who was very outgoing one day im in the waiting room hes just seen another patient and is walking her out of course hes struck up a conversation somehow the conversations veers towards cars and he starts about talking his own car and how luxurious it is he then says he wants to replace with the newer model of the same marque i dont remember maybe porsche anyway the other patient asks him how much it cost he says oh not much and then says a high number dollars maybe australian the woman is a bit taken aback and says thats more than my house cost an older woman there was a noticeable uncomfortable silence and then the dentist starts playing it down saying things like ill have to take a loan out to buy it its one of those things that if youre a fan you really need it but otherwise its a waste of money etc total from his big spender tone a moment earlier anyway he noticed that i overhead and as he took me into the patient area he was asking if i like cars i said yeah i love cars asked me what kind i had i said i have a lambo he went from big spender to feeling guilty about spending or whatever on a car to feeling poor because he didnt have a lambo to be honest though ive never felt ripped off by a dentist something like a crown isnt cheap but its also a rare purchase for most people the annual check up and cleaning just costs a couple hundred even less after insurance they provide affordable and unaffordable products with the unaffordable ones they can really gouge you but theyre rarely necessary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am suddenly so grateful for my dentist i had to get crowns last year but i didnt have the dental insurance at the time so my dentist allowed me to pay in terms to him directly until i upgraded my insurance again for the new year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dentists are also widely hated and iirc have the highest suicide rate of any profession
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont follow how does dental ins drive up costs vs a fee for service dds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i live within minutes of tijuana which is pretty much the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only thing is unless youre in pain it takes weeks from initial interview to treatment and every appointment is hours longer prepare your self for lots of time just sitting there waiting for the dentist instructor to check the student every step bring a book
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill work on you when i start in clinic next year just come to california
Showerthoughts,not_removed,here some people fly to turkey for example get tickets hotel week vacation and operation still cheaper what they charge here for an changing a crown ve been deliviring plants and pots at an dentist home fucking pool plants and pots few hundred dollar each big house same people that after letting an internee showing floss instructions for they charge you afterwards €
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i paid about half that for a root canalcrown combo and not much more for wisdom tooth extractions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,come down to san diego i know a guy with a van who will do it for half as much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow america really is fucked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my comment wasnt necessarily directed at you but i find the concept of a tooth demon that takes your money away hilarious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,waitrose big spender £ can feed a family for a week in aldi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i joined denplan for £ a month and get all dental costs covered i take the piss by going for a full scale and polish every days too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have no clue what you guys are talking about but as an american up at i am now hungry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my brother literally had a tooth taken out earlier this week it cost him £ so it can be cheaper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy fuck waitrose charges £ for a sandwich that makes me wish i were dead i could buy a whole load of bread an iceberg lettuce a packet of bacon and a tomato for less than that and do it myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,north here only get lidl and aldi so you mean a weeks shopping not a sandwich
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy hell in us i have insurance my sons wisdom teeth just cost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not the same cost though for example in the uk we have charge bands band £ band £ and band which is about £ however not everyone has to pay you do not have to pay for nhs dental treatment if when the treatment starts you are aged under under and receiving fulltime education pregnant or have had a baby in the previous months staying in an nhs hospital and your treatment is carried out by the hospital dentist an nhs hospital dental service outpatient however you may have to pay for your dentures or bridges you do not have to pay if during the course of treatment you or your partner receive income support incomerelated employment and support allowance incomebased jobseekers allowance pension credit guarantee credit universal credit and meet the criteria or you are named on or entitled to a valid nhs tax credit exemption certificate in the us these costs can be much much higher
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but normally not on a level thatll fuck up you finances
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only for cosmetic stuff if you have issues that affect your health and quality of life they fix them for free you dont have to pay for fillings root canals wisdom tooth removals and all that if youre under and need braces you will also get them for free thats years and years of procedures devices checkups retainers etc completely free for everyone and even things that arent free dont cost nearly as much as in the us ive had quite a lot of work done and ive never paid more than € for it my grandpa had a few teeth pulled and his new implants cost about € each
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats also outrageous is how few patients want to take responsibility for their own oral health of what we do is preventable if patients brush and floss as directed and stop eating high carbsugary diets some of it isnt and certainly hurts the pocket book but no one has a right to complain about paying to fix a problem they could have prevented
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which in turn is connected to the massive amounts of debt we get into which other countries dont also other countries dont have to spend as long in college if they go to dental school some countries its years after high school and little debt it makes sense once that enters the equation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stop drinking soda
Showerthoughts,not_removed,vintage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why the fuck are you even paying insurance with deductible and only coverage how the fuck is that possibly worth it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that may possibly be the single greatest family deductible for dentistry i have ever heard of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a bit but not the full whack total cost for a root canal which didnt entirely work tooth was cracked followed by an extraction and making up a plate so i dont have a gappy lower front was about £ getting a proper bridge made gums just about healed need to make an appointment to get that done will be about half that again going fully private you could add a zero to the right of each of those numbers then double it if you want the work done somewhere clean and hygenic with staff that speak english
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in zimbabwe a apple costs trillion dollars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because i would break my jaw
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still thats basically free is comparison to what private costs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely not i
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like you are in the us maybe dentists here in aus have an easier time hope things pick up for you soon my wifes cousin is a doctor and owns his own practice even he is amazed at the earning capacity of his dentistry friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know whatll pisss you off your professors likely went to school at a time when there was an admission rate and likely not much debt is like a year in just interest folks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,usa in czechia it only costs about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg partnership in a decent sized practice thats busy all year every year better than winning the lottery even if all dentistry was covered under a universal healthcare system and you couldnt just charge what you wanted for most patients youd still be rich
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also is it just the dental school near me or are all male dental students cute as fuck and they seem gentler than medical students like less ego or like they are less alpha or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk how you get debts but over here there is no way that happens besides once you become one and have a job you can pay it back faster then i can pay back my year mortgage on my house
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep my sisterinlaw is studying to become a dentist its great that we have so much knowledge to educate our doctors but it really shouldnt be so cost prohibitive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,come practice in india your ford taurus will become a mercedes in one year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let me guess you paid that money to dentists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well the dentist he described is every dentist he knows just introduce yourself man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and if youre dedicated youll pay off those loans in years a lot better than other professions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,after working years that might be you too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,canada here i know people only consider how expensive dentistry is and assume we make tons of money but hell ive been busting my ass for years to get into this program and with the amount of work we have to put up with in school only to get out in years and have to pay down hundreds of thousands in debt i think anybody who understands would say theres a reason dentists are well paid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even though you have loans that just a couple extra hundred bucks a month if youre making six figures to a lot of people the debt is basically another cell phone payment but on the other hand youve worked really hard for your profession so you deserve to be compensated for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what happens if you are born ten years to late
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure in time you too will be rich as hell
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats so hard about starting your own practice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,question how did you achieve i was under the impression that even in the us a degree will be closer to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure the vast majority of the dental fee is for the equipment and expertise necessary to install the crown correctly rather than the crown itself like the stint a cardiovascular surgeon uses for a bypass is probably pretty inexpensive to manufacture too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am sure it is a very steep markup probably costs to make
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the knowledge on how to prepare for and i stall them is a whole lot more valuable than the materials
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that sounds like what they do with eyeglasses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey lab person why dont you cut out the middle man and install those crowns yourself oh wait i love my lab dearly and they are the ones who make or break every case but the doctor does a lot do you think the orthopod setting your broken shoulder should charge just above the cost of the titanium parts and to answer the question i charge a crown and my lab coat is between depending
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shame on you you know all the extra time materials and skill it takes for a good crown to be placed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for how many crowns i have in my mouth i would undoubtedly throw up a lot my mouth has been more expensive than any vehicle ive ever owned with dental insurance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is true i think i heard a statistic that dentists have the highest suicide rate of any profession with a comparable income and higher than a lot of professions with much lower incomes i may be misremembering the details though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and yet most dentists ive met seem quite happy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in tijuana you fix your teeth and get your dick wet at the same time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why we go volunteer in mexico
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is very true i didnt discover the program until i was in pain i had gone in for an emergency pull of the tooth which they do daily but instead they recommend i save it and get a root canal had to wait a few days what blew me away is that there were people with insurance using the program i didnt have insurance so it was a must but i guess the deductibles are so high that people do dental school even with insurance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks for becoming a dentist seriously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,here some people fly to turkey for example get tickets hotel week vacation and operation still cheaper what they charge here for an changing a crown in sweden thats very common when it comes to plastic surgery they used to go to poland today turkey thailand combined with some vacation etc ve been deliviring plants and pots at an dentist home fucking pool plants and pots few hundred dollar each big house same people that after letting an internee showing floss instructions for they charge you afterwards € my private dentist is one of the richest in my municipality at least given the official salary figures so i understand what you mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love that you are complaining about how much dentists make while talking about how expensive your pots and flowers are hey plant and flower people charge way too much those things should be free
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im in sd who is this mobile dentist you speak of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i were you i wouldnt advertise that he cut you such a good deal now hes about to get like emergency walkins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you just got him business only reason i dont go to dentist is its fucking up my credit because i cant afford to pay the god damn bills off i cant even go to the doctor i have health insurance and my family always tells me i should go do both but all of my debt is medical related im done with that shit america is fucked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op delivers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hungarian dentists are chill a friend of mine visits the country on a regular basis just to get dental work done
Showerthoughts,not_removed,twist op is the dentist and just did some epic viral marketing for himself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you will check him out in the near future
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow he has a hungarian name dentists here are dirt cheap compared to other places pretty sure if you fly here have a holliday for a month get your tooth fixed youll still come out cheaper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the way its been in the uk for a while now just because theyre on a weird angle doesnt mean theres a problem if they arent causing any issues just leave them be taking them out causes more problems than leaving them of the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,especially with child birth my gf just had a baby and was curious to know the cost south of the border and heard numbers between and thousand dollars before insurance that seems almost inhumane to me we paid and that was because we wanted a ptivate room for a couple nights
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aldi im sorry daddy warbucks ill stick to lidl for feeding my starving children
Showerthoughts,not_removed,german products are taking over the uk now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,waitrose is an upper class supermarket chain over here quite expensive and mainly targeted at upper class folks i believe the royal family also has their shopping done at waitrose waitrose sandwiches are renowned for being quite tasty but again kinda expensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have insurance and you paid for it the fuck kind of insurance is that how do you even call that insurance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then whats the point of the insurance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck i had a root canal and a few patched up teeth for the cost of edit of course im from europe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive had wisdom teeth removed at different times total cost didnt exceed rupees including dental xrays and stitch removal and followup appointments rupees is approximately dollars and this was a great dentist in the city of bombay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my sons wisdom teeth surgery was covered by medical insurancedid you check dental coverage was pretty much nonexistent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plenty of dentists in the uk charging for crowns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by the way you need line breaks to put the quotes on separate lines
Showerthoughts,not_removed,root canal and crown in the states could be near for one tooth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends you definitely pay for a prosthesis for instance just not the full thing unless you have a really good mutuelle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as far as i know dentistry and medicine in general also is longer than years its usually and then there is usually some kind of specialization that follows but i dont know much about it so i wont claim something if im wrong about college debts youre absolutely right thats another problem of america insane cost of education but on the other hand other professions get screwed by that too not only dentists and doctors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what does soda do to your teeth and what about alcohol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does anyone go that long without brushing their teeth jesus my mouth would be a biohazard by the end of the first week
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmmm maybe i should start brushing my teeth regularly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my deductible is only then insurance pays its worth it because this year ive had a saline ultrasound an mri then a surgery that required a hospital stay with insurance i paid about for everything without it would have been upwards of dental insurance is much cheaper than standard health insurance though its about a month if you work for a decent company
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because its the law dont pay for insurance and get a big fat fine that doubles every year or some such nonsense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a root canal is where i live i need i have no clue what to do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,root canal and crown can be near for one tooth here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bottom teeth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice well if it works keep on doing it do you use coconut oil i have read a bit about it and could see how in theory it would work but keep in mind you arent going to cure a cavity if its too far gone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know what dentists actual situations are but thats certainly a stereotype here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ask your wifes cousin if they will hire a yank in years i may be fleeing a trump presidency
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dentists in the us make over a year on average and depending on what city you live in that average gets close to i think hell be okay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no way dentist in the us have it made parttime and make a year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a mate of mines dad is a dentist in perth he has a fucking lamborghini
Showerthoughts,not_removed,partner up with another dentist open your own practice and profit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like hearing this in australia we are like apocalypse from x men edit i dont have a boat but my bikes cost more than a small house
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah they tell me that and they feel sorry for us they also tell us that the days of opening up a practice out of school are damn near gone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,czech republic or chechnya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wont be broke but in loans that arent subsidized is insane
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel this profession attracts people who are more personable unfortunately you get egos in dental as well since some people are gunners and want to do oral surgery or something that requires you to be top of the class which dental school do you live by
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the dental school here is known for having attractive men in the annual mr contest its almost always a dental student who wins apparently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as someone gay this intrigues me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well truth be told i am at a private dental school it was either this or take another dice roll the following year at getting in elsewhere im sure ill be fine finically in life once i graduate though just sucks that i will have such a huge debt coming out that post pones opening up a private practice or keeping my costs low for the patients
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpdentistryusceduprogramsddscostofattendance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep a lot of times the sophisticated equipment is leased
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dentists pay usually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not much in raw materials but what youre buying when you have a crown fitted is materials plus the experience it took to learn how to make crowns plus the service of having them fitted by a dentist who also had to spend years studying and practicing to get to where he is it would be nice to be able to spend a flat on such things but what youd get for that price is a fella with a chisel a hammer and a toothshaped rock most likely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea dentists and now american troops overseas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,havent watched the video yet but i appreciate the reply if you compare fees between a ffs and ins practice i dont think youll see a statistically significant increase w ins im low in my fees and i also take insurance meanwhile i know people in my area charging double what i do and using the same lab
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also the anesthesia is a combo of tequila and being distracted by a donkey show
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even if you dont want to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah the tijuana bay waterpark
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but if you hear about a donkey show stay away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too i want a mobile dentist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he got him business which i dont think is a bad thing i doubt he would have cut the op such a good deal at expense to himself so maybe he can profit even more off those emergency walk ins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless hes advertising for himself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i broke my arm a few months ago doctor recommended i purchase the nhs ppc certificate for three months to allow me to get unlimited prescription medication instead of paying a £ charge every time i needed meds i thought the £ was a little steep but whatever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my wife just had a baby with insurance it cost us about nothing there was a because we were admitted through the emergency room and another because the baby was admitted to the nicu which was in a separate hospital i think the cost covers by insurance was or so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a friend who is a doctor from italy but he works in one of the top hospitals here in the us he was suspended for not billing patients when asked why he said he didnt believe that people coming into this world and leaving this world should have to pay medical bills he got his job back after a week of suspension
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah its not that much i would estimate more around still way more than most other countries but not life ruining at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok american here i went to a lidl for the first time what the fuck is it its like bulk food with bins of clothes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i work shifts at the hospital my favourite thing to do when im working late is to head to waitrose where all their really really good fresh sandwiches get reduced to £ this is the only time i shop in waitrose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for insurance companies to get rich af
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nhs dentists others are private charge those specific prices feel free to check the nhs website at most theyre £
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that the queens crown thankfully ive never seen such thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blame your indoctrination that socialised healthcare is socialism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,canada too i just had a root canal done after it was all said and done thats with no crown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck is wrong with you people it takes like three minutes per instance is minutes per day plus another five for flossing is that time saved really worth the dental bills and anguish that will come from not brushing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget to floss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go do it right now trust me you do not want to be in my position i didnt brush between age and and ive had teeth removed already all of my upper teeth and several of my lower teeth have to be removed i face thousands of dollars in bills and thats just for the extractions i have no idea how ill pay for the dentures that i need im considering suicide just to get away from the pain let alone the horrendous bills ill no doubt be paying for the rest of my life brush your teeth you do not want to be me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is fucking ridiculious i pay a month and get most of that back from the goverment have a maximum deductible of per year and that is it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its about a month if you work for a decent company thats only because part of your salary is the premium that your company is paying on your behalf already
Showerthoughts,not_removed,go to a dental school its a lot cheaper and an expert endodontist watches us so you get quality care at a great price
Showerthoughts,not_removed,move to scotland be one of those medical tourists the rightwing tabloids rant about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats disgusting how your country can allow that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fly to europe its much much cheaper even without insurance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wisdom teeth they are growing sideways and messing up the work my braces did
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do they all live in p sherman wallaby way in sydney please tell they do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oversupply i moved house years so and not only cant find a good dentist but cant find any that can get me in without about an eight week wait its coming up on end of financial year and i have like in dental extras i can spend too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op should go to the england i think they only have like dentists in the entire country
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is s dentist i go to in port melbourne
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in karnataka india we have an over production of dentists so much so that the government has decided not to permit any new college to come up i live in an are where there are about competing clinics in about some of them start clinics with bank loans right away while others spend years to get a seat and study masters courses but yes the ones who are making money are really living it up they go work in the gulf north america australia eu etc and return with a lot of money
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in my experience having moved a lot changed dentists avoid the younger ones they may have the cool offices latest technology but all that cost along with the loans theyre paying off with less decay due to fluoride treatment better oral hygiene they are pushing things like invisalign more emphasis on cosmetics recently i was told i needed crowns either replacement or new before i could even digest that information i was told how nice veneers would look in the front after recovering from shock i went to older dentists for opinion both said only crowns were needed couldnt understand why someone had said except for cosmetic reasons mind you the first dentist is very popular it is even hard to get appointments that said theyre still running groupons other marketing tactics to get more business i am so glad i found my new dentist in his older drab office apts are easier to come by i imagine hes comfortable by now in life not still chasing the mighty he came highly recommended he wouldnt be in business for as long as he has been if he wasnt good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get him outta here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill put the word out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tbh you should flee if either hillary or trump wins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even after san jose you people still think its trump supporters who are violent and intolerant damn the media is too strong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does he own the clinic or something and what kind of lambo is it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bought a nice one a year after i graduated the biggest tip i can offer a young graduate is to practice in a small town or rural area and stay far away from the cities everyone wants to live and work in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,czechia is the new official short name for the czech republic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i chose a book for reading
Showerthoughts,not_removed,czechia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was under the impression that this was a real country and i was just having a stroke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,czech republic of chechnya someone was asleep in history class
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not when you make a year it isnt its called perspective
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as long as your hands dont get mangled or you dont lose interest in working dentistry then youll be fine right the education and training you got is worth way more than
Showerthoughts,not_removed,finally getting the credit we deserve
Showerthoughts,not_removed,their butts as well maybe its because they spend all day on their feet but wow i reckon their butts are bigger than average
Showerthoughts,not_removed,know some folks at midwestern looking at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hindsight and all that but you really shouldnt have gone to a private school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jezus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,atleast youll earn this percentile median percentile httpmoneyusnewscomcareersbestjobsdentistsalary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets not forget invisible pricing which enables dentists just like standard doctors make up their own prices on the spot without real competition or inclination to lower them this is even more apparent when you dont have insurance and you can negotiate the price down by huge amounts this is why cost of health in the us is so absurd while for the socialized medicine the government actually has market competitions on who gets to provide certain medical equipment or services which keeps the prices far lower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dentist has the machine in her office scanner and the crown making machine she told me she learned to use it over a weekend course yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok now you are depressing me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til im glad that ive never had to get a crown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pls no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i forgot that you still pay for prescriptions south of the border
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have one of these and ive probably would have spent about £ in prescription costs this year alone so yeah well worth it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,last summer i was on vacation in estonia and i broke my heel we were really worried about how much it was going to cost and after about four hours in the hospital it cost us € for the wheelchair renting cast and all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for reminding me to renew my card £ per year and all my pills paid for is a bargain in my eyes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have much better insurance than us then we have a deductible before theyll cover jack shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually he is my girlfriend grew up in the us and moved to canada about years ago our son has dual citizenship
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its all really good food and the clothes is good too its super cheap because they buy in bulk its the best thing in the world i prefer aldi i find it cheaper and their chocolate spread is better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at my local one at least theyve got a range of food thats always there but theyve also got bins full of completely random stuff that they switch out every now and then its a really odd place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats exactly what it is good food and clothes though not all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true although ms has quite a lot of business from the commonfolk myself included due to their own brand percy pigs swear those must have cocaine in them so addictive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im in canada and my dental is about the same except the plan i have to have through my job doesnt outright tell me how much is covered and theyre inconsistent with how much they pay out except that they make sure to tell me that my maximum per year is for example the website says for cleaning and my most recent claim actually covered something in the vicinity of im terrified im going to go in for a filling one day and theyre going to nope out of there and give me bucks and a pat on the back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if your premium is a week thats a year definately better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually its about and that price includes and no matter how many sessions it takes to complete your treatment you will never be charged a penny more than this and on top of this if you have a nice nhs dentist they will refer you to a dental hospital if they think your treatment will cost in the highest band which means youll pay your £ for band but get all the treatments for the band problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,canadian here im lucky and unlucky i get a free full set of implants soon enough but my teeth are rotting from birth problems the govt is nice enough to pay for it if you cant prevent it just gotta hide my decaying teeth until they decided to do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right now i have a lot of teeth issues didnt take care of them enough for the past few years and i hadnt seen a dentist in like years yeah i know so far ive seen my dentist times i had to pay € at the end i just saw that the sécurité sociale reimbursed me about € now since there wasnt any big work yet the mutuelle should cover the rest without problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me it was just a motivation thing i didnt really have anything telling me to just go do it and it was never much of a habit my classmates would say like they couldnt stand having dirty teeth it just didnt feel right but i didnt really care much recently ive started brushing and flossing every day so hopefully i can mitigate some of the damage ive done over the years luckily i think i have good genetics as my teeth arent completely falling out by any means
Showerthoughts,not_removed,flossing is ridiculously important possibly more important than just brushing even
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the guys name is p sherman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when you say dental extras i imagine rappers getting excited because their insurance covers their gold grills
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know why but it amuses me that youre in india and your username is squidwardnopants i truly do fail to grasp the reach of american entertainment culture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i already fled
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel hilary is just going to continue obamas course and honestly isnt that bad but i dont like either of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,especially killary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah til thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve got it wrong czech republic is the only nation of united nations that doesnt have official one word name so the name czechia sometimes already being used anyways has been proposed so it is officially correct name to be used alongside of the czech republic and most of the czechs actually dont like it but i just feel like people dont understand that it is not replacement but just another option
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you really really dont have to take on inndebt and spend years after college to make
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the us that is also at interest rate from the good ol fed you have to make a shitload of money to have be worth it i would not go into dentistry now if that was my loan i graduated years ago with so you can see how ridiculous cost is getting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what they tell me but ill let you know in about years after i graduate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a year in interest dental school in the states is beginning to not be worth it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no eduation or training is worth four hundred thousand dollars
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know one who just graduated in the range i married her a couple years ago our glamorously rich life had us packing everything we own into a uhaul yesterday in degree heat so we can spend three days driving across the country to move in to my parents basement a clinic patient asked my wife if she would be buying a mercedes when she gets out of school yeah maybe in a decade ramen and a late jeep until then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i broke my tooth in a softball game a few years ago and it was to get it fixed this was a tooth that i had broken before and they spent like minutes fixing it that i had to battle with my insurance company over because they said it was cosmetic dentistry fuckers my front tooth is broken and i cant eat or drink cosmetic my ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly where are all these magical ass plans for me and my wife
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think that guy thought the same as me your first comment makes it seem like youre american and south of the border would then refer to going to mexico to have it on the cheap lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,from what i understand its their equivalent of costco in the us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the belief is that socialism is a step towards communism communism is the ideological opposite of capitalism and in practice has resulted in some of the worst military dictatorships the world has ever seen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as these are not prosthesis acts you wont pay a cent and you should have already been reimbursed by the mutuelle and in america for these three root canals treatment including a molar you would have payed over a dollars not including the composite resin to fix the teeth were lucky in france even tho we dont say so about dentistry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,paul wall baby
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not that surprising actually considering that india has the largest or second largest number of english speakers worldwide fluency may vary though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know nothing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair i had a friend i met online refer me a job interview for a security job at a defense contractor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey its me ur brother
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt that how all us redditers got a job thank u gallowboob for ur referral
Showerthoughts,not_removed,interest to buy an asset like that is a bargain so long as you can actually graduate and practice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tell me if youre still single too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i disagree my wife is a pediatric dentist in her full year out of residency she will make shes in the process now of buying into the practice and will make around with production and ownership distributions you dont think a yearly salary of isnt worth of debt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually a lot of training and education is worth four hundred thousand dollars a year you just have to figure out the monetary value a degree will add per year then figure out your average worklife span sorry for sounding condescending but this isnt difficult math granted im not saying people should actually pay that much money for a degree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when your earning potential over a few years is greater than your loans i think its well worth it is a huge number to all of us but if you want to roll with the upper class youre gonna have to take a risk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,always frustrating to hear that people never even think about the cost of materials staff lights ect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im currently getting my jaw readjusted because when i broke it a few years back the responsible doc said itll grow together just fine now i could basically only sleep on one side because of the pressure in my jaw and itll cost a little over € to get it fixed because insurance only pays if its mispositioned by more than a certain angle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your insurance probably wanted the dentist to just pull that tooth instead much cheaper not saying that is cool but i am sure that is there logic in that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as someone in london can you just stretch it a tiny bit further its not far promise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in this conversation south of the border transformed from america to london and no one seems to have noticed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and you should have already been reimbursed by the mutuelle just checked my bank account this is not the case but it shouldnt take long in america for these three root canals treatment including a molar you would have payed over a dollars murica
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let me see your grill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but a majority of their english is brit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,meanwhile internally they were thinking dont be a terrorist dont be a terrorist dont be a terrorist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,found snowden jobs done boys pack it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is a difference between a friend you met online and a passing reddit comment too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fair enough but its often overlooked the cost of becoming a dentist as well as the cost of running a practice its not black and white collected is not profit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what in his pants
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its good if youre a specialist that sounds like an awesome practice for her congrats thats not across the board though and the future is more bleak for general dentists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude you realize the time time to rent a surgical suite alone is expensive the overhead youre also paying for at least a surgeon anesthesiologist nursespost op care bed you know what a mechanic charges to change an air filter in his back yard it cost him and the knowledge of how to do it you know that soda you get at mcdonalds they charge you for something that cost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eh theyre clearly scottish we noticed were not just constantly thinking about america
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair though you were hired to be placed on top of a plate of spaghetti not exactly the hardest of jobs mate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,met a guy at a reddit meetup three years ago and he got me a job still working there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how can you spare some details im actually interested in idea of job hunting on reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wish i could make a joke about that but im literally not sure if im allowed to for legal reasons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think the cost of medical school is all that often overlooked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no the object of the conversation switched seemlessly from america to england without anyone pointing it out and the subject remaining the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought the camera added pounds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have however had sex quite a few times and can attest to just how absolutely fucking incredible it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are different viriginities to be had
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair this is a retrospective post to a week ago when i hadnt had sex not gonna say its not great but the aspect specifics and benefitsnegatives of actually losing your virginity is kinda of a once in a time thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my main gain from it was always being a very intimate human and having that level of intimacy with another person is just indescribably amazing when you get it right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not necessarily but the second place would
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure he would manage something a freak accident on the way to the competition
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt that make the second place the most disappointing man on earth though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is like inception it just keeps getting more and more disappointing you have to be massively disappointing to become the winner but all the disappointment that is brought to the dude on second place wouldnt that make him the real winner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but then he would win and not be disapointed anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or would he be disappointed because he isnt disappointing in everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is dr black mr hyde httpsenmwikipediaorgwikidrblackmrhyde
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah a story of a black man who takes drugs and starts beating and robbing folks is probably not right for this time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,black sploitation films were the shit theres even a blackenstein
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget the blunch black of blotre blame
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could just tap your brakes a few times not enough to slow down just enough to make the brake lights come on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because its against the law and common sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would blind them and cause an accident just get over in the passing lane and let their dumb ass pass you in the regular lane because they arent competent to drive legally
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is why there is something called brakechecking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never works sometimes i even slowly coast down to about less than the speed limit and then speed back up to over times out of ten they just get right back up on my ass i usually find a spot to pull over and let people pass if i have to slam on my brakes for a deer or something i dont want to also get fucked from behind because your dumb ass had to tailgate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this running lights in the back have to be red i suppose you could flash you too brake lights but thats been said already
Showerthoughts,not_removed,those kinds of drivers wouldnt care if you used some other method to get their attention theyre going to tailgate you regardless i wouldnt do the slowing down thing that just makes them angrier sitting back there with their fingernails embedded into the wheel vein on their forehead popping out screaming whys this idiot slowing down im tailgating them as hard as i can gaaahhh theyre just going to tailgate even closer if they have to keep slowing down and speeding up is this on a multiple lane highway where they can pass you easily or a single lane with solid yellow lines
Showerthoughts,not_removed,single lane lots of turns little chance to pass hence why i just pull over
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why is this such a common post lately let me ask you this what if you were traveling towards a light source wouldnt the light still be hitting your face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wear a miners helmetthe light will travel with you like throwing a ball inside a moving carmomentummaybe i really wouldnt know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if you hold a flash light pointed back at you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only if you started in darkness and moved away from the light
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a classic physics debate light is both a particle and a wave if it behaves as a particle its affected by momentum and your scenario is correct waves however are not subject to momentum like screaming out of a moving car the cars movement forward doesnt affect the speed of sound and therefore the helmet flashlight wouldnt work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only the expansion of space
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i still dont know he existed and i created the meme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i still dont know he existed and i created the meme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,criminals will be shooting down drones to steal the packages it wont work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,guys like thick legs dono bout that one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont use knives to cut lines i use cards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a friend who isnt a native english speaker who loved hemingway one day as he was reading he stopped and asked me what does cut mean out of the blue turned out hemingway had described one man as cutting another socially obviously i had some difficulty explaining the concept to my friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its like cutting their heart out simple
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats an awesome description thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is shallow thinking a cure for cavities would involve healing them or regrowing teeth etc it would still be a service you would need to purchase from a dentist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cav•i•ty noun an empty space within a solid object especially within a body tell me how exactly do you cure this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think a cure for cavities could remove my wisdom teeth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even if there was a cure or way to prevent cavities from ever forming the dental industry would never publicly announce it just like if there was a cure for cancer money and greed rule this world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all health care is based on the presence of disease
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i went to a subway sandwich shop and i said let me have a bun but she wouldnt sell me just a bun she said it had to have something on it she told me its against regulations for subway to sell just a bun i guess the two halves aint supposed to touch so i said alright put some lettuce on it which they did they said thatll be i said its for a duck they said alright well then its free see i did not know that ducks eat for free at subway had i known that i wouldve ordered a much larger sandwich lemme have the steak fajita sandwich but dont bother ringing it up its for a duck there are six ducks out there and they all want sunchips
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive found that a childs opinion of me is very much influenced over whether or not i have candy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,way too early dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are people out there that dont even know this game exists i had to show a group of people once when i made a reference joke on it theyve never not had no internet connection
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you need to start hanging out with people whos iq is above
Showerthoughts,not_removed,totally true if you go to clubs otherwise you cant bear it but thats why i also dont go to clubs anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tips fedora
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even if you believe in the stereotypes i dont think thats why people hate jews
Showerthoughts,not_removed,given that the rich are capable of creating and designing propaganda to force people to see and us vs them dynamic it works rather well when everyones at each others throats so often they dont notice when the rich and powerful run off with all the fucking money money is blind it doesnt care if your black latino or jewish you will work for whoever pays the most hell it could be the black jews that take all the profit but noone would ever know everyones blinded by hate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its statistics that hate blacks the most
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how do you know this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unfortunately i have met people who hate jewish people indirectly for being successful they believe its a conspiracy and that jews plan on taking over the world to screw everyone over every successful jewish person is evidence that this is happening
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its the noses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what a truly offensive thing to say upvote
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah ive never heard anyone say its because theyre successful which would denote that they have earned money through a good work ethic a racist would say manipulative or stingy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuck rhinitis fuck that shit my mother has it i have it and its not really that bad but its annoying i hate it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know a guy who has gingivitis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id say zits more than butthole im pretty sure earths butthole is florida where its warm wet covered in shit and prone to attacks of strong winds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my butthole doesnt splatter innards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like how one of the descriptors of florida is covered in shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nor does mine from a crustseek medical attention op
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its one pair of underwears
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why so negative the glass is always half empty with you i say one pair of underwear is actually two pairs of underwear
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lawnmown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,catthrown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gamethrone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,daaaang ur right aliens in the brain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is sam in the shower with you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes too damn pushy with those damn green eggs and ham why the fuck are you trying to get people to eat green eggs sam where the hell do you even get eggs with green goddamn yolks you sick freak
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how is that a showerthought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gofuckyourselfkid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no wtf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont think so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,copyed from front page i see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,raskreddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the tallest ive seen was the wall in game of thrones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i peed into the grand canyon thats the best i got
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the space station
Showerthoughts,not_removed,has that really been peed off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do humans live there where does their urine go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its probably recycled into drinking water transporting fresh water up there is expensive so it would make sense that theyd try and conserve what they can
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about the ones that are not alive yet but are not dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am not currently dying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in other news people who arent eating are not eating and people who have their eyes closed cant see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you start losing cells faster than you make them in your so youre incorrect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone is slowly dying if you think about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,priorities my apartment is small and cheap so i can live alone most of my friends have nicer places but also roommates
Showerthoughts,not_removed,house poor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know a guy who lives on skid row so he can drive a new porsche every year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a house always has resale value furniture and decoration loses value once it enters your front door you are better off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,living forever means a loooooooooooot of cancer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this would also result in lots of incest if people really wanted immortality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hits blunt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean eternal immortal means not able to be killed by mortal means
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if theres only one that person would be treated as an outlier left out of the data set if it were up to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it wouldnt at any given moment that person would be a specific age the average age would always be increasing but the average lifespan would never be infinite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the only vampire i know told me that living forever really is not all it is cut out to be and sometimes really sucks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only if said immortal actual lives to the infinite point otherwise people on average get a longer life on average because math
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would be a different infinity than if all humans had infinite lifespans though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imo its only infinite if we wait infinite time before counting him in the average which cant be done as far as science currently knows otherwise when he is years old his lifespan is currently years not infinite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,infinity isnt a number so you cant add or subtract or divide it right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,living forever also means living to a point where scientists can replace body parts with cancer without killing the patient including brain because what deems a creature immortal the soul attached to the body giving it life if you believe in souls or the body itself in which case just because the body doesnt die doesnt mean the mind wont age into pudding at some point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it means forever and thats a mighty long time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you gonna pass that shit or what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must be fun at parties youre right tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no immortal literally means not mortal mortal means you can die therefore immortal means you cant die
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiimmortality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it figures that there can be only one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is correct as an outlier statisticians would declare a single instance that is way outside the data set an outlier and wash it out if the set also an you could only gather the data of a persons life span after they had died so an immortal could never actually show up in the data set
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mean
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not at any one moment but after a theoretical infinite amount of time it would be infinite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course it sucks thats how they eat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but the raw mean is still infinite thats why you use the median or simply remove outliers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wtf please send link if you can
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of lifes great questions isnt it i believe this is the ship of theseus problem pertaining to the transhumanism dilemma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre a brain the body only serves as protection fuel and brain world interface
Showerthoughts,not_removed,passes blunt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i collect molds spores and fungus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,trending toward infinity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,digisignaali is my middle name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never heard of it being called by that name but it is a very interesting concept nonetheless thats why entitling things as versions became a thing i believe in that at its core it is still the original version but with slight or moderate changes it is now but at what point does it become since non of the original parts are there but aspects that were added to make it still are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,says your brain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thx so im looking everywhere for my lost bag of nuggs and im under the bed with my flashlight app and who do i see my cat dr snuggleton md and hes got it tucked in his collar best part i had put it there like minutes before i started looking for it im like whaaaaaatwoah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fungi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikishipoftheseus read up son
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pizza bagels
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he only has the one fungus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i understand the concept and actually pulled this page myself as i responded
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the mushroom is my only friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how are you high
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how high are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no officer its high how are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wut
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good turnaround sir be on your way now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think the most effective solution is to start calling them ifs everyobdy wins that way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,volkswagen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no u
Showerthoughts,not_removed,moms like you choose jugif
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get a coffee maker with a programmable timer set it up after dinner wake up to a pot of coffee in the morning ive been doing it for years because i too hate fumbling around with filters and pots of water in the morning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cold brew coffe the night before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,crack is whack in large amounts but every once in awhile its cool if youre in a safe environment things i wish i learned in grade
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk depends what it is pot is fairly safe heroin on the other hand is so addictive theres no moderation to speak of i personally do believe people do drugs when they feel stuck andor fundamentally unhappy maybe we should be addressing those issues
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some things are better left unnoticed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what woman gets aroused by balls theyre disgusting lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but do you find them as attractive as the way a man sees a womans boobs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,between them and breasts is there even any competition
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres no glare at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same mostly because im still asleep at since i was up till
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because is where the real people play instead of olds that complain and whine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,noob i am comfortable playing video games from to and then from to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends on the game some can only be played with the lights off for full effect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too although thats probably because im pretty much nocturnal at this point and wouldnt even be awake until pm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am often at am playing games with pm from a friend that i am not wanting to play with if it were pm i am sure that i wouldnt receive pm like i did at am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends on which game youre playing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my wife would not be very accepting of late night gaming also my dog doesnt give me an option to sleep past gaming has been a non option for many years now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would this still be true if you moved to a new timezone hours ahead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i used to be like that now i suck at games if i play late i am so much better at pm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i complain and whine that i get killed by olds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,calling noob is still a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes like outlast best experience is with lights on and brightness at max setting and no audio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would too if i didnt have a job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive read this over multiple times and still have no idea what youre trying to say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its never silent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,train your dog better or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely noob s
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its about personal messages still dont get it the guy is probably drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,after reading it about seven times it makes sense he gets a personal message pm from someone he doesnt want to play with at am but he does not get that personal message at pm i think bit confusing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he plays late at night so some person he doesnt like wont talk to them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i believe the or something is being a responsible pet owner and understanding that its not fair to force your dog to change its very natural schedule
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and when called noob i should call him as a nerd it stills work that way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats gotta be it kinda funny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i actually think its that he plays in the afternoon because hes messaged at am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what i was saying just trying to use am and pm as much as possible for different reasons clearly it was unwise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or too pretty and not wanting to be harassed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lame or doubtful beauty is in the mind and has nothing to with eyes or perception
Showerthoughts,not_removed,darwin would slightly disagree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean id do something about it but my phones about to die so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you cant beat them join them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doesnt really matter because theres nothing we can do about it its written in the constitution weve been fucked for hundreds of years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre fucking yourself over the blame game always ends with you mother fucker
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it always matters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the constitution does not mention my phone battery i checked
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt matter because we dont matter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay ill give you my email and you can e transfer me everything you own
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you misunderstand me thinking you can make a change is foolish but you can try and you will fail because the system is setup to make sure change never happens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay fuck the system and transfer me your assets ill deal with the system
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get a job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my net worth is probably more than you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,congratulations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what a shit show
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agreed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,awful lot of hubris in this post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,raccoons are pretty smart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,divide by zero
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the world may never know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the dream catcher sends them to the dream messenger who delivers them to the dream chucker who chucks the dreams over to the dream recycler who recycles the dreams for the dream processor which processes the dreams for the dream chucker who chucks the dreams to the dream deliverer who delivers the dreams to ops mom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all of my doors are boarded up like that i dont like visitors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably because parallel boards would make much more sense as bending one board over the other would make for a high strain on the second board leaving it prone to popping off or breaking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its kind of like how you could be more successful if you would google questions before posting them here but arent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because people still buy them money means it doesnt need to make sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought we werent going to talk about this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its like how there are so many marvel comic movies but none are marvelllous
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all the taken people should just wear rings on a specific finger or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,great idea what about the finger thats supposedly connected to the heart what was it called again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,deleted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no you unsober idiot why would you use multiplication for this you scare yourself half to death twice its which dead get better weed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the title is wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im dumb i need to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,innards are gross on the outside
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty much everything thats potentially gross only becomes so after you have to look at it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,especially if its a big glob that i have to try not to walk through on a sidewalk gross
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shit is gross after its left the bhole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,put your finger in somebody elses mouth and tell me if it is only gross after it has left the mouth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,think about fingernails you bite them they are in your mouth for a moment but once you take them out putting a removed fingernail in your mouth just seems horribly disgusting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thought it said salvia had a bad experience every time with this shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like poo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would agree
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so when you are kissing it must be even worser then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,salvia attracts hummingbirds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dunno its pretty gross when it enters a mouth too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel this way about long hair love it connected to my head disgusted by it when it naturally falls out and i find it on the bathroom floor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup kissing is gross who wants cooties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is stupid even by rshowerthoughts standards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by the time salvia has left your mouth youd be tripping balls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also a bit concerned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre not alone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats not gross though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,had no experience at all on the first four tries and the fifth time suddenly everything was degrees turned and there where little people living their daily lives on my left body half building civilizations and shit cities rising and falling entire cultures emerging and decaying until seconds later when everything was normal again interesting herb for sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair this is the kind of thought i would think everyone has i certainly thought of this way before i found reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if they lived the same amount of time neither is older regardless of timezone differences
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why because of time dilation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not necessarily time passes more slowly when you move faster
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if you have long hair
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought i was going crazy when this started happening to me it turns out my husband uses my shampoo but not my conditioner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no sir there be girls on reddit girls like me with long hair and i can tell you conditioner shampoo ratio is in my book
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too drunk to be interested wtf bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pro tip if you want the dog to like you best be the one who feeds it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a little peanut butter on your junk should do the trick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant mom wakes up way before me to feed him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,posting a shower thought that you didnt get in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,posting a shower thought that you didnt get in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the hidden ball trick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and how would you know that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also because we dont know how to express them or we think we will seem less manly by doing so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think your reasons for hiding your own feelings dont apply to everyone and there are lots of different reasons different individuals might bottle up their feelings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me after i grew up yea i dont want people to share my burden but as a child i tried to hide my feelings just because i havet seen any male doing so seriously my family went through hell and ive seen my mother cry plenty of times and my father not even once im and ive never seen my father cry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,women do that too but okay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is actually more a a woman rationale op are you sure you arent woman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always just think theres no tears in baseball and i want to get to third base tonight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always thought guys were born adults and just decrease in age and maturity until like then theyre grumpy old men i have a vagina
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also if were at dinner i dont want to do smalltalk about other people because i consider it disrespectful just because i wont gossip doesnt make me very quiet tonight
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like unmanly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some of us should have learned more from their english books
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder if they teach the kids that the saudis were behind the attacks and that the iraq invasion was based on lies and false precepts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that reminds me my middlehigh school history book sections on vietnam were only about pages with nothing about the gulf of tonkin incident apparently we dont like teaching about our false flags
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of us should has learning much from there english book fixing that for you sir
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk when i get home next week im going to grab one of their books to see what it actually says about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was wondering that too specifically if it mentions the commission report being the full story and if it depicts people that question it as nutters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never heard of that incident will have to do some reading
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just like santa claus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am jaded by amas ask me anything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if your going off tangled she also does a lot of housework around that tower normal ordinary housework can be a serious workout when you do it properly i cant manage half the stuff my girlfriend does around this house for us just because im not in good enough shape to keep up the cadio then throw in that rapunzel in tangled was using her own hair to climb up high on the walls and such so if youre just going by tangled it makes sense shed be in pretty good shape
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that or she would consistently be starving to death if there was a lot of time between visits from the witch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,controversial
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people watch reality tv shows today so not really
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was boring when it came out the visuals were good but thats all i can say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reality tv shows are not really that similar to most peoples lives
Showerthoughts,not_removed,big brother is a bunch of people forced to be in the same house together its kinda realistic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you sir are an idiot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes im an idiot i hate myself lastly im a girl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry you maam are an idiot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we did it reddit we ah fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its amazing to think that we carry around all of the knowledge of man kind in our pocket and we are able to video chat with someone on the other side of the planet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everything but memes is too hard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i suspect that if you had the drive to listen to that music read those books watch those movies or learn that language then you would probably do those things without the existence of the phone or even the internet it wasnt an access problem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,accomplishing nothing how dare you memes are amazing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,flashlight thermometer day planner map digital wallet calculator coupon book gaming console every single one in the palm of your hand were living in the future
Showerthoughts,not_removed,livin the dream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,feelsbadman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,read any book yea if you have money for it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tesla predicted the smart phones invention nearly a century ago probably would be disappointed with what its most commonly used for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,porn instead i browse porn looking at porn and accomplishing masturbation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget the porn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,with my brain i could obtain the knowledge to help the world become a better place cure cancer end world hunger and fight the obesity epidemic instead i look at dank memes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess its just because a permanent obligation to make decisions is not what feels right in leisure time thats why i find myself watching cabletv from time to time its the pleasure of not having to choose but i guess this is a matter of different generations dont think you can make a really understand what could be a reasonable use of cabletv for instance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i read listen to music watch tv play games use reddit and do most of my word processing on my ipad no wonder people are addicted to their computing devices
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it amazes me that so many people actually only use their phones for social media and texting or calling its a tool to learn anything you want at a moments notice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have the ability to do those same things without your phone too and your reasons for not doing them is the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one more reason to stop looking at that crap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yet we use it to text our friend who lives right across the street from us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where can i get this drive you speak of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then what is it how do we solve it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in his defence he didnt say read any book
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can torrent books too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or from one bedroom away
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you wouldnt download a book
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think not knowing what happens after death is one of the reasons why were afraid to die
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are a lot of ways to die and a lot of them hurt people dont like to hurt and we also dont like change which is what death is really its a change from the norm of living and ill be damned if ill change for anyone think about that last sentence if i die ill be damned presumably to hell so i put off dying change for as long as i can sounds like something out of a movie script im going to go to bed now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe thats why we are afraid not knowing what happens after that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you all really really believe that death leads to eternal paradise why do you wear a seatbelt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think people are most afraid of leaving everything they have built in there life and all the relationships they have made
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont mind dying as long as i get to see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many people are actually afraid of dying as in not existing im not afraid of my existence stopping i am however afraid of the process being really fucking painful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do have you never been to vegas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no im from australia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its also a representation that someone with no job an artist who works in fast food and someone who is incapable of passing their driving test are all able to afford houses and live on the same street
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an art major wouldnt be able to afford squidwards place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he would probably do a lot better if he stopped just painting himself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it also implies to never give up what you truly love
Showerthoughts,not_removed,squidward is also a crank old man who hasnt embraced come to terms with his sexuality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,squidward is a representation of art majors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,squidward is the terrence howard of artists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no wonder hes so depressed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but squidward is really bad at art
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i resemble that remark
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would you like fries with that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bikini bottom is probably the ghetto part of the ocean the buildings are made from boat mufflers ffs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tbf there is a lot more space in the ocean than there is on land
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think the lives under a rock thing is more the point of patricks house
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe his parents chipped in remember when he moved to the squid town all had the same houses so it seems it is cultural which might signal even some kind of herritage fund so all squids live properly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i call this one bold and brash more like belongs in the trash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i only realized this now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit how does a childrens cartoon have so many meanings and messages
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and if that doesnt convince youthey consider krusty krab a fastfood restaurant as their finest eating establishment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good writers who make shows silly and colorful enough for kids while keeping some big themes for the older generations when the kids want to watch together hence why shows like avatar still resonate with tons of different age groups
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and the krusty krab is made from a lobster trap yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not to mention adult humor doubloons dont drop em
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one of out of of the time it works all of the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they are similar not sure if equivalent is the word i would use
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would creepy tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too especially squirrels here in florida
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same but people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you must love cats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you say thank you to all the animals you have eaten
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the thought came to me after i watched a video of a moose being rescued from a frozen lake these people spent hours helping this fuckin moose get out of the ice and when he got out he just walked off like an asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont even remember if i checked the mail today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,anymore when did you ever our memory isnt exactly all that great we forget most of our days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i still remember my first memory but around the time i turned i started to wonder if it as real or a dream or maybe i imagined it i have no one to verify that it happened so how do i know i didnt just make it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hah exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont even check the mail anymore i just go online read the news and check my mailbox once a month to check for random crap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the point i used to have a distant memory thats gone now lots of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ooh trippy true its doubtful your parents would even remember it so who can you go to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i doubt it people dont just litter in the streets anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you never heard of ampme get phones together and you have songs loud enough to party to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpwwwbassheadspeakerscomloudestbluetoothspeakers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,these are all bigger and quieter than the hell on earth i am imagining
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it depends on your stance on fetal rights i dont think so because i dont believe youre a person until birth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id assume if you used the term visiting then youd need to be in the surroundings ie out and in it if that were the case youd have visited every spot your mother took you while you grew from a couple of cells to an infant thats my thoughts but its a fun thought though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,space capsule
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i came here to say that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you mean fonts that have indistinguishable is and ls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you mean lls hawaiian bbq hell in a cell for macaroni salads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,precisely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plot twist youve met your future husband
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably depends on how well traveled you end up being
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for real the closer they get to the road the easier they are to take down with my truck a mans gotta eat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well not the egypt wing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a lot of lottery tickets tho they are kinda expensive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one in a million chance work out nine times out of ten
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if youre gonna get the lottery tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now youre talking apply bayes theorem d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the british were really good at naming people indians and then telling them their society was wrong like crazy good at it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,christopher columbus was spanish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fake implies they were pretending to be indians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they also for irish and indochinese people lotta i people got screwed by the brits maybe even iceland but i dont know for sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre right he was the only one to fuck over american indians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre all a bunch of phonies big fat phonies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea i was struggling with how to describe native americans in this thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,perhaps both the indians and incorrectlynamed american indians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or you know humanity wont actually see either of those
Showerthoughts,not_removed,might
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what every celebrity says as their last words before being killed by their infamous stalker
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think you know what infamous means lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in·fa·mous ˈinfəməs adjective well known for some bad quality or deed an infamous war criminal synonymsnotorious disreputable more looks to me that being well known for killing a person fits the bill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,huh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre as smart as they need to be they just havent realized it yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i dont get it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never been fishing so theres that too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i try not to get involved in fishy business
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont fish anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,school should ideally equip you with the tools to figure out how to do shit by yourself rather than explicitly teach you how to perform certain specific tasks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they have to fill school years with something im two years into my adult life and i have yet to play a recorder read or interpret shakespeare or do math beyond a grade level
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure every kid ever had had this thought this is generally because children are incapable of understanding interconnected knowledge and how certain fields of study can positively influence important life skills that arent directly related
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stop posting this the point of school is learning how to learn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree public education should take a page from boy scouts and help build character and problem solving skills
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but learning to play an instrument is very good for brain development thats the recorders purpose interpreting works of fiction does a great deal to teach critical thinking and the ability to create logical connections in indirectly connected ideas thats shakespeares purpose and highlevel math fosters abstract thought and logical deductive reasoning thats advanced maths purpose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe but i have yet to build my own table
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why not you were taught research skills if you took english and science classes and you likely had a computer lab as well you should be able to find many ways to make tables online with these skills of course you will require basic mathematics for the measurements thankfully school also supplied you with this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what i meant was a furniture wooden table im not a native speaker
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i know thats what i was talking about as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what i meant was that i dont need to build a table i can just go to ikea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,waitare you saying that they actually taught you how to build a table in school
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats awesome im sorry but they dont really do that where im from i did not expect that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well you cant have sex with the animals all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,raskreddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cow had baby baby suck on udder udders have a similar feature to nipples human babies love nipples yolo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some guy on reddit pretty sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it took me a minute to realise what you meant but thats actually kind of cool be fun to cuddle with such a person to clarify you mean two different people having heart rate and regularity and lets throw pulsatile strength in too be exactly in sync right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think this is a showerthought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it really is a lot more difficult than that though real comprehension requires your brain to be strained and activated just like a muscle studies have shown that your brain is least active when you watch tv or simply just sitting in lecture you dont actually really learn when someone tells you something you learn when you make connections and try to apply that information elsewhere as a current physics and astronomy undergrad i can assure you that you will reach a point where that format becomes almost utterly impossible to achieve any real clarity and you will have to dive into tons of other sources to truly understand whats happening
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on one hand no because viagra works by increasing blood pressure which a blood bender could do through their powers although itd be painful for the guy in question on the other hand viagras purpose is to make things straight which is the opposite of bending
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure its the low self esteem and statisticly have the smallest penis per average on earth but who knows
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe its the fact that the men vastly outnumber the girls so they use this porn to get off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,their awareness of it probably comes from our porn i wonder if in a few generations the bigger penised japanese will have more sex and therefore drasticly raise the average penis size in japan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id really like to see a source
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for realsies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt shit you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well you actually just did fellow redditor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not at all my good man httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimajortom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikimajortom helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep ill see em on the other side
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to everything turn turn turn there is a season turn turn turn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just joined a csa and the farmer put pictures on facebook of herself planting the lettuce im going to be eating in a few weeks it was a pretty neat feeling to have so much transparency in the consumption process
Showerthoughts,not_removed,csa farmers marketstheres all kinds of ways to know where your food is coming from and im pretty sure everything in the regular grocery store tells you on the little sticker where it comes from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,transparency
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im high i dont understand what i did wrong with that word
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people who are are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,has anyone ever really been even as far wanted to do go look more like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,should read there are always options when it comes to fucking whether or not you enjoy it is a different story altogether
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is uncanny where did you come up with this so damn true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the people of rwheredidthesodago are a stupid breed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it depends on the animal and if its natural or not if one cow talks that wont prevent me from eating the ones that dont because the one cow that does talk is weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,being able to speak doesnt mean the animal is capable of complex thought hell siri can talk and no one takes her seriously why would we with animals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,humans do more than speak english and yet we kill each other left and right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,while eating i have the meat and it doesnt speak english so yes there would be a different story for the butchers tho
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends on how stupid the things they say are i doubt chickens would be intruiging interlocutors
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do they request it would you eat a parrot or a lyre bird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hitch hikers guide
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if i tell you animals do speak english as seen in the documentary animal farm the farmers are just covering it up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never eaten a live animal so i think yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id convince them into believing it was good to be eaten by me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but usually you dont eat them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but we dont eat them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,usually
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and islands are just really small continents
Showerthoughts,not_removed,europe is more of a peninsula
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,follow your dreams
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what does that make fennel a trans onion that wanted to be a celery
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its as if theyre masturbating the penis of their own selfdiscipline by not masturbating their actual penis
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im more satisfied by not hearing it at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have no idea why i did this but when i was in high school mostly grade i would get up at either or in the morning however i always had an alarm set for am because it felt really good waking up and knowing i still had about hrs of sleep left
Showerthoughts,not_removed,extreme snoozing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get a pet it will wake you for many reasons you can get up to feed it let it out clean the puke up etc then go back to sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,workdays i more often than not cant wake up weekends i can hardly stay asleep why oh why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do that everyday i do have a job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well thats how you interrupt a perfectly good dream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rlifeprotip
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but a dark colored shirt equalizes all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about the shoulders
Showerthoughts,not_removed,milk syringe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but it doesnt suck up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the kinds of people that support the death sentence dont usually debate policy they just skim over the news and memes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i imagine people who are antideath sentence are just more vocal possibly for the same reason antiabortion protesters are notoriously vocal they feel they have the moral high ground and want to flaunt it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so goeth the rules of mob justice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i got banned from world news for calling someone a british cigarette and youre absolutely right about it just being mildly interesting to me now since i cant participate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he didnt give to the weak most of what people know is christianese even with christians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was martin luther king not jesus things being equal and all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he didnt have any possession at all how can he give
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jesus accepted the fact that there will always be the rich and always be the poor while he certainly wanted everyone to be treated with love equally i dont think he ever taught anything about income equality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if she has twins is it a foursome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not necessarily true ive had many more threesomes since ive been married than i did beforehand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you consider that a threesome then its also incest and sexual assault of a minor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,man thanks for ruining my prego fantasies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would be afraid of bludgeoning my child to death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well your mom sure liked it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well we are christians so i doubt ill be as fortunate as you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well he did say the closest thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,her doctor specifically said it was totally fine and safe i thought thats what she said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is christianity against threesomes my wife is catholic and it sure hasnt stopped her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,catholic is to christian as mudskippers are to amphibians a needed link but not remotely the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mostsome christians are against any sexual relations with someone you arent married to the convictions of my wife and i happen to fall in the mostsome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess shes not orthodox bc its obvious catholics are against nonmarriage sex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why the best part of waking up is folgers in your butt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,remember when you have nothing else to live for theres still coffee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like drinking coffee but if i ever reach a point in my life where the best part of waking up is folgers in my cup im not sure i wanna wake up mike birbiglia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,squeeze some actual oranges then look at orange juice from the store is always way too thick and a strangely very opaque orange every time i think of orange juice i think of a tanning bed shop in telaviv and say to myself orange jews im weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about the bills that are stuck on walls to advertise upcoming concerts or events they can be slightly useful sometimes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like the beginning of a potentially great blues song
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so deep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please do enlighten us whether the effect is useful or not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are they really though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,false dogs can stub their toes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my cat has stubbed her little toe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,think about it have you ever seen an a imal stub its toe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im and want either myself or the rest of the world to vanish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now is a good a time as any there are things in childhood that adults would rather not put up with again and difficulties in adulthood that children cannot grasp yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im and im still wondering what i wanna bedam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah being a kid was shit for me im happier now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think im that old yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you okay buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relax im not actually gonna go through with it dont take life so seriously thats probably the main thing i miss from my childhood not taking life so seriously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,u wanna be a dam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely not d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im is just the beginning itll get better i meant this lightheartedly keep your chin up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take your upvote and leave
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your mind is created as a function of the minds around you in a way youre simply a mirror reflecting the other mirrors also youre probably a repressed homosexual
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe the little guy feels intimidated just give him a few strokes up his belly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha i am quite confident in my own sexuality thanks for the lucy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bet he is damn right scared like hey man i dont wanna be around naked guys so i am gonna hide till you are done lemme know when you are back with wifey
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre confident youre not gay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,very comfortably straight thanks again lucy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no worries sarah its always nice to talk to a client
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never read peanuts before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a good show man but im not that kinda gal listen could you pick up my dry cleaning for me aroundmidnight minutes to midnight and counting down fast
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good question at the end of the day i suspect horses resent vehicles for fucking up all of that sweet sweet pastureland with asphalt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a horse passed by in front of my car as i read this lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what a racially inclusive show
Showerthoughts,not_removed,indeed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a way it would refer to the instrumental of stainless by logic and compare it to backyard by travis scott
Showerthoughts,not_removed,proper practice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the injection may not work and the condemned was to die by lethal injection not infection like on a battlefield you kill a man with a clean bayonet it is a good kill you use a rusty bayonet it is murder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because they dont make special needles for executions they just use the regular old sterilized needles that are actually made
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because we are a civilized people and we have medical standards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why dont they just use straight gas its cheap its very fast and it works every time its what humane slaughter houses use on hogs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so the gun doesnt jam
Showerthoughts,not_removed,imagine being sentenced to death by lethal infection
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even for people who are literally about to die to be honest i dont think my dying wish would be that the needle is sterilised
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gas is painful try blowing into a balloon and breathing that in againnot lethal what people have suggested is nitrogen asphyxiation nitrogen is way better for that purpose although i am against the death penalty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or lethal inception
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alternative facts are pretty popular these days im sure the weekly world news and all the other trash tabloids are rejoicing right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is way too deep for

Showerthoughts,not_removed,sick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,answer the question okay whatever that where there when then wtf where have i been
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also works with whosethose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mind blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you replace the h in what with a t and flip them around you get the who
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you replace the t in that then and there with a w you can be a jeopardy champion just dont forget who
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every day with this shit please give it a rest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its only midnight here and i have not smoked nearly enough weed for this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ikr
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never heard this and it kind of blew my mind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its barely morning here and i havent had enough coffee for this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,really id be surprised if id seen it here less than times it would be in the top few lists on top all time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well in that case on average i have quite a decent life because a bunch of parallel mes have way more awesome lives but about the same sized bunch also have way more horrible lives
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the night in my dreams im in love with you cause you talk to me like lovers do i feel joy i feel pain cause its still the same when the night is gone ill be alone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah assholes and rich people always live longer and she has both going for her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well now youve done it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or a cellphone which is getting close to everyone africans living in corrugated steel shacks have webready cellphones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the many living people who you see everyday are specifically those who are able to breathe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except it doesnt stop and causes all kinds of problems for people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres levels to this shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,insectsmonsters so they do exist and your justified
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apparently there is more dark matter in a dark room vs a lighted room so technically we dont know what is in dark matter so you have lot of unknowns that you reaching your arm out into
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats to stay safe from the large spiders that live under there duh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a cat who likes to bite my foot if its over the edge of the bed or outside of the blanket so i guess shes the monster
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am the exact same way im a grown ass man and i just dont feel comfortable with it like that ever since we were babies we have associated comfort and safety with a blanket so naturally i think we still hold that today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a relatively tall individual i am forced by the size of my bed to either have my feet andor arms off the bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i laughed thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,such a stonely day and its mine the most stoneliest day of my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im happy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your comment and username have just won this thread pack up guys its time to go home this guy wins it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that just got a hearty laugh out of me oh my god such a stonely day should be unbanned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your all fuckin high
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean i put this on trees first soooo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wasnt barking were all high
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel like its the opposite kinda
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its funny that most people leave their bag of salt at home when they go out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres not ive never played an online game with a stranger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,read the bottom comments and youll start smoking a pipe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,username checks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive noticed most top comments are short op post picture of tiger cubs playing with a big ball of yarn average comment something suggesting theyre just like house cats shit comment an over thought out comment like this one im doing now top comment awww
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just start clicking a few of those show replies down towards the bottom of the thread it gets real mediocre real fast
Showerthoughts,not_removed,truei just had the same realization a few days ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so if this becomes your top rated comment will you redefine witty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yessss this is so accurate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if its a good thread ill resort it by newest comments first but most times i leave it as best first i need that sweet reddit wit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rocks gray rocks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow sounds like people are real insecure on reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre so much wittier than i am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm started smoking a pipe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,samezies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have a pikachu on your shirt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i asked a couple of my pilot friends about this and they said they were obligated to ensure they guided the plane to crash somewhere void of people they said theyd want their passengers to jump with parachutes if they had them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant even
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its like op expected a pilot to come on here and say that hed grab the parachute and do a double backflip out of the plane while flipping off the passengers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but im saying what if there was a parachute
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the honorable thing though not the thing theyd do
Showerthoughts,not_removed,since july falls on a monday this year they are probably celebrating the holiday on july since they most likely have monday off but not tuesday also all the big and official fireworks will be set off on july so it doesnt make sense for them to compete with bigger and more ostentatious displays
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because explosions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because i work early on the
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because theyre sold weeks before hand and are unattainable the rest of the year since they have them on hand they use them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who made you the celebration police
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we went to see the fireworks on friday night granted were in canada and july was canada day happy independence day americans and happy birthday to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay michael bay youre not fooling anyone with that username
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unattainable for the rest of the year not entirely true many states have them year round mainly because theres nothing else to do there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oil didnt come from dinosaurs it came from plant matter when large tropical areas where crushed and buried by the shiftingcolliding tectonic plates its where coal came from too oil is just coal squeezed and heated a little more escaping from the oil was a natural flammable gas that built up a dome over the oil deposit thats what is burning when you see oil rigs shooting flames out of them they use to release it but sometimes it ignited now we tap it and store it its called natural gas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relative to what if its relative to a nonspinning earth then you are always breaking the speed limit no matter which way you drive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this argument is self defeating
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mm is a whole unit vs fraction of an inch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it really makes you stop and think doesnt it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no stay banned your filthy piece of shit or pleasant dude who was wrongfully banned either way stay banned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol xd no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive tried looking also maybe contacting the slow mo guys and suggest that they would do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is a pretty shitty comparison though stoned sex is amazing so maybe thats what you meant or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how did you get here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by riding my magic reindeer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i want to crochet a rug
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jellyfish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,milk a cow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you want to be a jellyfish or go jellyfishing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt your experiences start to differ immediately after the clone is created leading to differences in thoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,insightful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and you will have very well ventilated super big scary bugs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you looking for rcrazyideas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes actually i forgot where to post this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im in australia fucking absolutely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder why they dont i bet there is a weird copy right issue preventing them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this would be a good thing yes but its just as easy to pause the clip on the first second and wait for it to load on youtube clips the bar at the bottom normally has the little white line racing ahead of the red line to show how far its loaded to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes the video will only buffer for the next x seconds so stopping the video at the start will leave you with the next seconds loaded and thats it wish there was some way to ensure the whole video will be buffered
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that hasnt worked in years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its best when you have dicks like me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,couldnt you find any nice friends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why the fuck are you not capitalizing tv let alone usa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,um youre suppose to capitalize abbreviations especially one naming something as a proper noun like the usa in fact you could probably skip the period entirely and just use caps instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,supposed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,feel better now also supposed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre home go drunk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,willie wonka
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is probably because he is a fictional character
Showerthoughts,not_removed,elves arent slaves they are just in a cult
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gru in despicable me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no hes fictional op was talking about real people like santa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe theyre just uneducated union workers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so innocent so pure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about period dramas
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sandy squirrel attracts sharks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you magnificent bastard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nobelium
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stop trying to make potassium a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so how does ok translate oxygenpotassium
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no you couldnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only in kazakhstan other countries have inferior potassium
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stop trying to make fetch happen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a chain of vaginas that links every person who ever lived too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everything that has ever lived too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then there is that one lonely guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol just
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is scrunch face slightly shake head jazz hands say the some random words in your native language
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chemistry defines a catalyst as something that lowers the energy bar for a reaction to occur and ideally is not used up during said process so it can be reused many times example given the required resources you can learn a skill on your own or you can learn with instruction one of these paths requires less overall effort on your part and the instruction materials methodologies are generally reusable for others
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no im unique i challenge the world to find another me good luck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more like but nice try at mathing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i stand corrected however same point different numbers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres approximately billion people when you divide that by million where does come from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn neither have i but i also live in canada and nowhere near cherry orchards so i have a decent excuse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even the internet has failed me in this endeavor someone needs to rule this stat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people would be calling for legalization of tobacco
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the overall public would be significantly healthier and itd probably make for a lot better taxation because of its benefits beyond just smoking but it doesnt have the addiction tobacco has so its likely tobacco still racks in more tax
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nothing wouldve ever gotten done except wed have much better snack food
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder what the us would be like if neither of those plants existed also any form of alcohol or drug
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably like india
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would be a lot easier to grow p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most time true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is as close as you will ever get to that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eminem would be better i feel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree but you know reasonable expectations its not like listening to dmx sing rudolph the rednosed reindeer isnt proof that sometimes shit happens
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bait
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its just a reverse gif of number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if it feels weird you probably just need more lube
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dry rub
Showerthoughts,not_removed,clearly you need more years of math
Showerthoughts,not_removed,se
Showerthoughts,not_removed,math not even once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by making some sort of signalblocking device that disables when the car is in parkneutral
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shit who likes decisions anyway they lead to stress and responsibility lets just yank out everyones brains replace them with us military computers and turn the human race into a bluetooth hivemind simple safe and efficient
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a manual transmission car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how could that be done
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it could probably work but itd screw over any passengers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what about using bluetooth or something sure texting and driving is bad but i drive alot at my job so if an important call comes in i still want to be able to pull over and take it or use bluetooth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,make all phones too big to get into a car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,put a scrambler in cars so if then are in the driver seat then the phone wont have any signal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there will no doubt be a way to do it some genius probably one who works for uber will come up with this edit although part of me thinks this should be something that people should just learn not to do its really not that much of a challenge to not text and drive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,genius youre gonna go far kid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that could be a problem during emergencies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its really not that much of a challenge to not text and drive and yet i so often see the driver behind me texting away oblivious to the traffic conditions and creeping along just a few feet from my car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get out of the car then use the phone or move over to the passenger seat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have the emergency number override the scrambler
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its actually appalling how many people do it ive never received a text so urgent that i must respond instantly if its life or death the only thing important enough to make you use your phone whilst driving then the person would be calling you not texting you still not ideal but at least with bluetooth etc there are ways round it there isnt a single text message that must be answered immediately theres actually a brilliant video floating around about this ill see if i can find it and post it edit heres the video
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can never understand how the higher in class you get the more freebies you get and how much rich people complain about poor people getting handouts its beyond me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre poor why would you buy something that is not necessary after all its a business rich and famous people can influence a lot of people to buy more of this kind of merchandise so its logical theyre endorsed op doesnt understand business for sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rich people get by far the biggest handouts they are the true leeches on western society
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre poor why would you buy something that is not necessary because sometimes you just have to treat yourself precisely to get a few moments away from your reality lest you go bonkers and start vandalizing stuff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have to buy over priced useless crap otherwise youll destroy other peoples property
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when oprah was poor did she vandalized stuff people vandalizing stuff when they cant have things they want thats the problem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a sacrifice one thats rarely noticed and even more rarely respected
Showerthoughts,not_removed,knew youd get stuck on that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,speechless
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its interesting how you think you know everything about me after thirty words ive said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its interesting that you have the impression that i think i know you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you might have something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,functions like its all held together with duct tape as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,snafu situation normal all fucked up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,always teetering on the brink of oblivion comforting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we always somehow make it through
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as i get older i realize a old
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we do assuming youre also in a first world country a lot of other people dont 😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,third world country here country somehow hadnt imploded yet but im trying to be optimistic here it helps a lot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they also dont touch when you say together but do if you say apart

Showerthoughts,not_removed,your body wants to ensure a sexy presentable corpse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,looks at nipples
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha ive thought about this many times ill wake up feeling dead tired yet my body is pushing resources into the production of horrifying long back hair if only we could dictate which non vital functions could just be turned off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your body is literally the living breathing example of well its how weve always done it and it hasnt had any kind of negative effect that we can tell yet so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you sound like a girl in once dated she had the same problem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or ear hair
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hair and nails do not continue growing after death a common but completely false urban legend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i fasted days just water i felt great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you live in ethiopia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,link karma op is mostly suffering from a lack of shame so pathetic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rubs

Showerthoughts,not_removed,head down lots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,had been living with my boyfriend for five years he was a master at making me feel worthless i was a fat child a fat teen and a fat adult at years old i was ft tall and lbs i rode my bike daily went to a gym watched my diet and went hiking every weekend it was the middle of november and he had just told me that i had no willpower and would never be able to stick to a diet and would always be fat i told him ill show you i am going to go on a fast and ill show you willpower im going to fast during the holidays that means no turkey dinner no tamales at christmas and no menudo on new years day i only fasted during thanksgiving and christmas i was going to try again after new years day i started april the first week is hard by the end of the second week i wasnt hungry i had so much energy i wanted to see how long it would be for me to feel hungry again people kept telling me that i was going to kill myself and i kept telling them that i loved to eat and i wouldnt starve myself because the minute i felt a hunger pang i would slowly work my way towards tasting all my favorite things again on my day died during a hunger strike my family panicked and said that if i didnt break my fast that day they would have me committed dammit i really wanted to go at least days my boss a paramedic handed me a cup of juice and said that if i didnt drink it i was fired and thats my story
Showerthoughts,not_removed,far worse at least you have theummthe pistons

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i work and i reddit and i sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea but i bet it will cost an arm and a leg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,could be considered to be mods
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i lost lbs to break my fast i did ten days of liquids ten days of easytodigest foods like rice tofu and fruit before i was sure i could eat normally my so wasnt happy with people telling me how good i looked and would bring a box of chocolates frequently or take me out to dinner or cook extravagant meals he would try to make me feel guilty for rejecting his gifts of love so by i was back to lbs i look back at those pics and realize i wasnt fat and gross he just made me believe i was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats new
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hope you didnt stay with him sounds like a real douche
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought at the time that any problems in the relationship was my fault and that i just had to try harder i actually married him and stayed years i threw in the towel when he accused my of fucking the marriage counselor to turn the counselor against him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well im really sorry to hear that no one deserves that bullshit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your people sound like jerks really boring ones at that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,less than or equal to the amount they usually do is what they mean but fuck that have all the fun
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i usually say this to my students when they are obviously offtask like hey kid i see you there dying of laughter about somethingand its probably not this grammar lesson were doing right now and if it istell me the funny thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats weird because im getting steadily better

Showerthoughts,not_removed,hello fellow texan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a former employee of whataburger i can confirm that it may or may not be true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or common bots just saying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt trust hate speech on this forum of free speech
Showerthoughts,not_removed,muscle memory at this stage was doing xmas shopping online on my mums computer and nearly went fapping instead when i turned on incognito

Showerthoughts,not_removed,eww
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not helping especially if you sit back and compare your life with other peoples highlight reels
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this terrifies me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uh what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when talking about internet conversations theres still afk that gets used a lot but i agree that i have not heard gtg in the last years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true being that we can take technology with us literally everywhere now conversations really dont have to pause though i also just spell out my texts since im not in jr high either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still gets used in online games
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can always just push her down the stairs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when faced with a mirror and nobody around i would make funny faces or huff and puff like a sumo wrestler
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha seriously why sumo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,coz i look like one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shouldnt ask
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if the filling process is over and no ones drank it yet its just in a state of limbo with no intentions of filling more or drinking for that matter the question should have more details
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not all drinking glasses are meant to be filled wine glasses for example is a wine glass that contains liquid half empty or half full or is it full since thats the appropriate serving size
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in actuality the glass is the wrong size
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree there should be more details who ever came up with the glass half blank analogy is a turd person who seriously lacks a well developed sense of logic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for the sake of the original analogy we must assume theyre talking about a regular glass like a pint or something you can read far into it and ask about wine glasses or decanters and other specialty wares but it only convolutes things for the wine argument it actually kinda works the same way because we are talking about the glass not the pour a wine glass can be filled to the brim or half way for that matter and vice versa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is no spoon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they both have similar hair and that ive fucked my body with substances look especially in the face

Showerthoughts,not_removed,misspellings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,activated via the grammar nazi button
Showerthoughts,not_removed,word is a very specific term for an element of communication actually we know quite a lot about animal communication from bee waggles to bird calls to dog play pants and gestures for instance heres an ape communicating that someone is an idiot and not worth interacting with i echo the sentiment to you now i wish my dog were here to look at you with disapproving side eye and go sit upwind of you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive had my cat for years and she understands lots of words i say outside the stuff mouse hungry toy etc but i only understand two words of hers i love you quick tongue flick and yer pissin me off double shoulder lap so whos smarter in the family
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt you just sleep off the high so theres nothing to experience or become addicted to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your brain gets flooded with dmt every night this is the strongest hallucinogen known to man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not all drugs are addictive but it would be the drug sleeping is a separate biological function most addictive drugs make it harder to sleep while going through withdrawl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could develop a chemical addiction which would really suckered because you wouldnt know what to use to get any relief
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats true so one would probably assume that its sleep they need
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which would make it even worse youd have withdrawal symptoms which if you can recognize these you can probably tell that they wouldnt come from lack of sleep if you cant recognize them as such youd be trying to get more sleep but the symptoms would make it even harder to sleep youd think it was getting worse because youre sleeping even less and it would spiral this is all assuming that this asshole ninja stops drugging you if they kept it up youd likely never know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm its just water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cinco
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is actually a gamepuzzle you tell people four is cosmic and its the only number that is then they have to figure out the rule theyll say a number like youll say is three is five is four and is cosmic theyll keep going until the quit these people are dumb and lazy and you should remove them from your life or till they get it

Showerthoughts,not_removed,the problem there is with your choice of music
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it will most likely be your car or your local emergency room
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmmmm on a similar note if we really are as close to colonizing mars as people like elon musk claim the last generation of humans to be born live and die on this planet has already been born
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men in black style
Showerthoughts,not_removed,welcome to quantum theory
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does that mean the universe isnt big though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,another form of relativity i suppose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it hurts my brain honestly so ill just leave it as that and not think further into it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the best explanation ive ever found on quantum theory was at the end of the first mib movie this thought fucks me up most as much as the thought where do we go after death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it does not matter either hillary or trump will finish us off before the universe explodes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there still would be people like me and my relationship that would be poisoned willingly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it stephen kings clown movie is coming

Showerthoughts,not_removed,how the hell do you rob a car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your car doesnt have an alarm probably
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure if hot water freezes faster than cold water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,try throwing something half the weight of what youre able to carry into the air its not easy and youll likely tire after a few throws
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my bother pointed out a similar example could a cement truck carry more weight while the drum is rotating because at any given time there is constantly cement falling from the top to the bottom and not being supported by the truck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hold your hand six inches off the desk and then let it drop thats what would happen to the weightless cement when it hit the bottom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seamlessr
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks diggity dawg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not that hard generally deaf people like myself are actually talented reading lips and the facial expression of people so it isnt hard to distinguish between someone yelling and yawning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably not body language is pretty different
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you usually close your eyes or its half closed when you yawn vs wide opened eyes looking at the person you yelled
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if its both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if its yelling and yawning probably the most awkward signs to read
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they had fat people hundreds of years ago fyi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think theres more to it than just the ease of obtaining the meal the quality of food is vastly different now id also be interested to know what size of portions they were eating compared to todays norm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey let me handle this question as i am qualified to answer it because i had french fries for lunch hundreds of years ago they had fast food in fact they had it thousands of years ago skinny people just eat less calories than ops mom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by fast food i meant the exact same fast food available to us today i shouldve been more specific
Showerthoughts,not_removed,happy day of the dead you should put their pictures on an altar

Showerthoughts,not_removed,not that weird unless were both weird its possible i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like a vast majority of this generation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what you drink what you play and what you listen to could answer that question ahaha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,right now drinking jack daniels playing out of the park baseball and listening to the history of the sword
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not too weird except i dont know why youre listening to that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like somebody got a thesaurus for their birthday congrats
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you have to be desperate to lose it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive always wondered how much easier it would be to get laid with no standards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are nokill shelters thats why you should always look for a pet at a normal shelter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,successful brain surgery yes brain surgery no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude dont make brains think about brains they dont know how to interpret information like that because they havent stopped thinking of themselves as human yet and not just brain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he didnt say an exceptional brain you still need a brain to even attempt it even if you fail
Showerthoughts,not_removed,huh youre right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant disagree with that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah they ran out of ideas after
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this time hes in a much greener land
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the stories are basically regurgitating themselves so bo surprise ill still watch them thoobviously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except it tastes like arse
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hiw do you know what arse taste like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dust to dust
Showerthoughts,not_removed,calm down mate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seriously they hate using freedom units
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt think i needed to know but now i need to know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i too must know the answer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aw yeh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,these are things that betas tell themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are two definitions of alpha number this is for ratings listings etc this is used for alphas in a group like wolfpacks first this can be used for premature versions of software sooo even though i understand your comparison i hate to break it to you that you are not correct
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im talking about people who fell the incessant need to express prove their alphaness its virtually always people who are broken in some way who take great pains to be alpha and they end up bugging heh everyone round honesttogoodness alphas rarely need to prove it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,proboly the same as what the standard price for a bottle of soda is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cents
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought they could charge whatever they wanted some random place i cant remember charged me for an arizonai was a little salty but didnt say anything about it because its cents i wish i could remember which can specifically but they dont put on all of them i think
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i seen arizona at target for cents one time

Showerthoughts,not_removed,this post will be removed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,false
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats just like your opinion man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it ran for years and also was considered to be a good show
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice edit op
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people from other countries can go out of their way to dislike or ignore us football if they desire it doesnt hurt us any but anyways yeah i totally remember how she said it too but for some reason my brain keeps imagining her pressing a button and a trapdoor opening beneath the weakest link

Showerthoughts,not_removed,through mirrors its pretty much just seeing your face

Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly he was always firmly on one side of the fence or the other
Showerthoughts,not_removed,agreed

Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you were an advocate for not masturbating itd still be thinking of good post ideas

Showerthoughts,not_removed,talking to women

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know its liberating to realize theres no such thi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as it stood behind you sizing you up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i still make sure my arms and legs are all the way on the bed when i go to sleep im not taking any chances
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that just means youre fat enough removed from watching the sixth sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because it was in your closet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,think about it long enough and youll still be afraid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to get everyone in the mood
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i stood two feet away from your moms bed while she grabbed her own ankles
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no now your afraid of someone grabbing somewhere else
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats when it gets you when you dont expect it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,umm that just means your no longer not an adult
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so year olds are adults ok

Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant blame them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til that make digs have nipples i looked down at my own nipples and couldnt figure out why this sounds like news to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nipples out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woof irl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had the same thought off and on for the past couple of years dont know why it took me most of my life of owning dogs to realise this decided to put this up as a showerthought after my dog demanded an extended belly nipple rub this morning but thought id search for dog nipples first to see if anyone else had thought the same glad to see i wasnt the only one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats second base straight people are weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know what second base is actually i was watching an episode of modern family and that columbian chick said it when forced to run the dogs belly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have those now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that already exists man from here is one

Showerthoughts,not_removed,a legend gone rip
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in sign language though they were calling you a wanker the whole time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should probably look up the definition of technically
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now mute guys are staring at their hands
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no but theyre saying o the whole time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and handjobs from a quadriplegic are technically a disappointment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not sure how that one works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this could also be converted to a joke what do you call a handjob from a deaf person a blowjob not my best work its am and im tired
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no they arent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the funniest thing ive read all week
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they were really just saying asshole in german
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wouldnt they be blowjobs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,must be sad to have a dog that doesnt smile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just like ops mom i would say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can often tell just by looking at their eyes and behaviour also tail wagging is a sign of stimulation not necessarily happiness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but they wont tell you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or how they get the caramilk in the caramilk bar or where exactly is the beef
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this data is error error error

Showerthoughts,not_removed,let the bodies hit the floor is about moshing though at least im pretty sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but only was written by paul shaffer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mashup pls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first decent mashup gets a shiny penny
Showerthoughts,not_removed,somebody should make a song that starts out with its raining men then suddenly changes to let the bodies hit the floor it could even be a trilogy if you add gimme shelter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow i never thought of this before and ive heard both songs too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mind blown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes i wish i could save my upvotes just so i can give a post like upvotes this is one of those posts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fun fact the song is called bodies thanks to pirated music downloads no one knows the actual name of songs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this just made my weekend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the real thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the event was
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre both about jumpers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that means the weather girls like fucking the dead apparently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the name of the fucking song is bodies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,false one song is about mosh pits and the other song is a metaphor for being surroundedinundated by lots of good looking men and i am getting so tired of seeing these recycledunoriginal shower thoughts ive seen this very comparison of these two songs on here previously
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets the bodies hit the floor is about moshing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ucharliwashere this belongs in rwritingprompts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why the fuck isnt it raining women godamn feminists always talking about equal rights and shit why arent yall raining down like men are why do men have to do the raining
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty sure america banned both songs after because americans are a strong resiliant and free people unless its words words hurt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what the hell are you talking about unless there is another version of these songs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can we go one fucking day without a joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,b r a v o charliwashere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha amazing 😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well its a funny post but its not true and detracts from the reality of the underlying esoteric meaning of the latter song let the bodies hit the floor is about people fainting when they finally are told the truth about the good side illuminati new world order and realize theyve been supporting it and loving its media the whole time theyve been hating it because liars out there told them to hate it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im singing in the rain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lsd is one hell of a drug
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the spirit of this musical thread i started reading your comment to the tune of millions of peaches
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hath cometh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just another day in warhammer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its raining blood hallelujah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like imagining this realistically oh sweet jesus get to gimme shelter ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no no this is how i want to go
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i thought he was talking about the stock market crash that started the great depression people jumped out of buildings it was so bad like a lot of people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,day somethings got to give
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that whole playlist is fucking satanic can you imagine having the meow mix jingle stayin alive some rage against the machine the barney theme and raspberry beret blasted into your skull for days on end while they tried to make you have a seizure with strobe lights i know we had a job we told ourselves to do but holy shit if thats not a way to leave a person as a haunted shell of a man i dont know what would be remix ear worm of meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow i love you you love the people of the sun hit the floor stuck in your head until you jam a pencil into your brain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i got hazed to this song about every night while pledging a fraternity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wasnt david grays babylon one of those as well imo the most heinous tactic of all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hey i went water boarding with a friend there once totally rad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is unbelievably adorable in a bodys hitting the floor kinda way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh wow thank you for sharing i love this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love that fucking bird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that is so adorable kinda sounds like jenny slates marcel the shell with shoes on character
Showerthoughts,not_removed,metal bird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont fucking shoot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,relevant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant picture someone who listens to that kind of music and has that kind of pet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pretty fucking catchy mate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,am i going crazy or do those fit quite well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to the top comment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i tried blending it with the original weather girls version and it still works pretty well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jesus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doot doot thank mr bot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aw man for some reason i was expecting them to actually play its raining men at some point during the trailer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats pretty fucking metal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that was an awesome trailer id love seeing that as a movie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,those guys have power armor but no helmets why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was epic ive never been a player of the series unless you count space hulk but this makes me want to check it out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is it just me or both songs are not in the trailer what is this rhailcorporate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no thats poop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it depends on the country in which its raining men
Showerthoughts,not_removed,men raining down from the sky one praises the event as a blessing the other can be seen as a more realistic and violent interpretation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was wondering if this was a tasteless joke with a very slow build myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he just quoted the song using quotation marks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tss tss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let the fingers hit the mutelet the fingers hit the mute i remember when that song was all over youtube for some reason
Showerthoughts,not_removed,skeeball court
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can only count to four i can only count to four
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that song makes me think of jet lis kill count in futuristic prison
Showerthoughts,not_removed,iiiiiim just tryin to tell you how im feeling
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats with the upcarrots before each word i see it everywhere and i feel like i missed something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when the men rain down from the sky many are deemed imperfect and let drop to the floor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,much better version honestly also how i got here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uinfinityalex
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aaaaaand thats enough internetting for me today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,be patient theyre coming
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a theory ones about bodies hitting the floor and ones about raining men what if they were about the same event
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or just hearing it on the radio or clubs pandora tv other people music playlists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think your reasoning is flawed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no that never happened ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op was trying to say that both songs may be in the same event but the person singing might have different perspective both song titles and chorus can be interpreted as bodies falling from the sky its raining men pertains to men falling from the sky and the other song is already quite clear bodies hitting the floor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a theory ones about bodies hitting the floor and ones about raining men what if they were about the same event
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you realize he didnt mention right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your artificial outrage is amusing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i get it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course a filthy presser would say that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsmediamakeamemeorgcreatedbooboowendyjpg
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bit of the old ultra violence
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all those men and he doesnt catch a single one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mfw i realize im gay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also literally
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you and i are of one soul
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what the ending of the trailer looked like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a web of connected songs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,day cant take much moooooore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait is there an underlying message im not getting from that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,somebody made a spotify playlist with the known at the time cia torture songs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i once had a competition with a friend to see who could listen to nyan cat the longest we both lost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm was a pledge
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my favorite torture songs are my heart will go on celine dion and i cant live without you barry manilow with myself as the performer thanks to some music lessons as a child i know how to sing in sharp notes and modify the rhythm so its aggravating im not allowed to sing karaoke anymore but my siblings will help with chores just to get me to shut up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont shoot its a sandwich
Showerthoughts,not_removed,early alt pop rock and a parrot why not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im surprised no one else had done it before me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can make a mashup out of anything if you get the tempos right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,considering the top comment is id say thats a pretty big climb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep totally thought it was going to be a trailer where one side is winning mercilessly and whilst its showing their pov its playing its raining men and form the other side let the bodies hit the floor am now dissapoint
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is a significant chunk of the warhammer aesthetic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,warhammer is a metal universe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,careful thats what people said about warcraft
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depending what part of the fluff you pick space marine sergeants and above dont always wear helmets either as a show of faith in the god emperors protection a show of superiority for the rest of the empire of man or just because they really enjoy watching stuff die face to face not to mention their skulls are about as solid as standard bodyarmour and theyre immune to most toxins of course the real reason is a mixture of ruleofcool and the fact that its easier for an audience to form attachments to characters with visible faces so characters that need to be recognized at a glance will all have to show their faces andor carry some form of unique marking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cool points
Showerthoughts,not_removed,budget cuts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to show off blizzards facial animations
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its an rts what you want is total war warhammer sadly theres no total war out yet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a little different more like a version of starcraft so its a smaller scale than the tabletop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dawn of war is great dawn of war is pretty good but its squad bases rts kinda feels weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the songs werent in there but it was literally raining men in the trailer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so not really an event but more like an image this isnt about something that actually happened
Showerthoughts,not_removed,floooooooooaaaaarrrrr why did this take so long
Showerthoughts,not_removed,death metal scream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youtube damn kids i remember when it was new and all over the radio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would you press mute twice you would just be canceling the first mute with the second one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was waiting for that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it should be rendered as superscript half size and slightly above normal text
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ohhhhhhh thank you so much this makes perfect sense hahaha how shallow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,schlongoblin shlong goblin oh god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,awesome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats what she said
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its raining men is about a woman having a lot of options for sex or am i crazy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think all of you are using the word perspective incorrectly as it pertains to an event its just a dumb post sure its a showerthought for an idiot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have any of you actually heard these songs i dont feel like anyone here knows what the hell they are saying
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he didnt mention it but fuck it fits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when the shit hits you fans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how have i never seen this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit this is incredible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the video is so quick but do we also see guys twerking there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sweet i worked on that video
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow that was a treat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahah amazing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bit of the old inoutinout
Showerthoughts,not_removed,literally figuratively that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,day its not unusual
Showerthoughts,not_removed,somethings got to give is a lyric from the song
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one somethings got to give
Showerthoughts,not_removed,saliva is alt pop rock
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres another in the thread its just not very good
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ah i see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what program did you use
Showerthoughts,not_removed,saw warcraft on monday its ok i liked it better than the new xmen has some problems but it was entertaining
Showerthoughts,not_removed,warcraft is supposed to be decent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,movies like wow should be r not i think thats part of why videogame movies tend to be so bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,warcraft was fine you just need to understand the lore behind it most critics dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and if theyre captains or above theyve probably got an iron halo forcefield generator so they dont need to bother with helmets except for like hard vacuum or extreme radiation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also theres the unreliable narrator explanation which says that they are wearing helmets but they arent shown because heroes of the imperium
Showerthoughts,not_removed,part of why frisky dingos xtacles were so neat but also felt better as the props they were mixing in their personal lives with essential anonymity was so odd but im clint
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainruleofcool
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fucking chaos worshippers are taking our jobs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blizzard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when there is it should be called only war
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtss are fun too it comes out next week
Showerthoughts,not_removed,loved total war and warhammer online the mmo but had no idea there was a total warwarhammer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is it as involved as something like starcraft ive played rtss before but stuff like halo wars battle for middle earth ii and a few others like that starcraft is on a whole other level though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it happened once in when a freak tornado destroyed a church in the american colonies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you perhaps do not know but music that specifically tells a story is known as a ballad one can argue that these two songs are ballads and thus are about a fictional event other examples of ballads are red baloons the song of silence hey jude let it be american pie and purple rain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,regardless there are bodies falling in both cases lets start there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,death metal o i am laffin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i remember when it was all over wwe and became their ecws theme song that one porno too where the girl gets destroyed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when youtube would mute copyrighted audio the uploader could choose to swap the track out for another out of a list and that one was near the top
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can still remember picking up the cd from a store that gasp used to be filled wall to wall with just music and people would go there and hang out and talk fuck im old
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well bodies is about moshing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude its rshowerthoughts its a joke move along
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well bodies is about moshing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more suitable to reference the plane that got shot down by a russian missile
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and now reddit knows
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes and its awesome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bit of the old razzledazzle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually virtually that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i though ut was the song somethings got to give edit i can engrish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,two somethings got to give
Showerthoughts,not_removed,saliva bodies is a song by drowning pool and yeah i would call it that what would you call it they might call themselves nu metal i guess but drowning pool is what was considered alt rock or alt pop in the early i mean that song was on the radio mtv and whatnot when it was popular a lot of people listened to it its certainly not a song that is specific to any particular subculture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fl studio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you see this one time on reddit cant even remember from where and think interesting and a neat sub but ill never see that again i was wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they also need to stop coddling nongame players on lore movies like john wick showed you can just jump into things and generally people will figure shit out in warcrafts case its not exactly conplicated stuff either
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heretic you suggest that the heroics of the adeptus astartes are exaggerated by lies may the emperor have mercy on your soul
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ya theyve been really good at them since the mass effect series
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alternatively fucking horus or xenos get out of my imperium reeeeee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alas thats their tabletop rpg where you play as imperial guardsmen they dont like messing with brand recognition i would love an adaptation of one of the tabletop rpgs though dark heresy or deathwatch or rogue trader thatd be pretty sweet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dawn of war no it comes out next year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i havent played it yet so i cant really comment on how intensive it is but you can look at gameplay from the previous games and make your decision
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sauce the porno of course
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a bad joke and its poorly worded then if i think its stupid and does not belong to be this high then i have every right to voice my opinion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why not both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reddit front page on tminus minutes and counting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres gonna be some ass in the forecast
Showerthoughts,not_removed,awesome
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,virtually literally figuratively that then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,three somethings got to give noooooooooow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mix saliva and dp up a lot either way i picture listeners as rottweiler owners not poultry caretakers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now i want to see a sitcom based on the emperors sudden but inevitable betrayal it would be something like the golden girls
Showerthoughts,not_removed,huh at first i thought you were ranting utter bollocks and then i googled only war and its a thing huh rogue trader would be best some sort of batshit insane firefly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh saw june and didnt even look at the year
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup username checks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i find it funny that your username is theshowerdrainsniper but you dont have a grasp on the concept of showerthoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,absolutely probably maybe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let the bodies hit the floor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how do reavers clean their spears they run then through the wash
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think if they were to do an actual crpg itd be best to go with dark heresy because its probably the easiest pitch to a general audience if im being honest if they went the simming the rules of the tabletop route rogue trader would probably be pretty cool as its interesting enough to make that work ship combat and the like being more interesting than diceroll gun fights but a dark heresy game in the vein of the witcher or deus ex or mass effect yes please
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my problem is not with understanding the sub one which i frequent its with how poorly this post was titled and the fact that most people seem to think that there actually is an event that these songs are as referring to knowing nothing about them edit the expression its raining men literally has nothing to do with falling even showerthought fine fair stupid post yes deserve upvotes no way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let the bodies hit the floor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,let the bodies hit the floooooor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some food is really artistically displayed i dont have a problem with taking a picture of a plate of food that is a thing of beauty i had a friend who would take pictures of food and share it with her family she was living overseas so it felt like they were together at meals when i thought about it like that i was a lot less judgy about people who take pictures of food
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they should announce the release of a sequel to groundhogs day then just rescreen the exact same version
Showerthoughts,not_removed,informative
Showerthoughts,not_removed,first world problems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you would have an unoriginal and boring showerthought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still felt like commenting must mean i really like this post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,does anyone want to jerk off twice in one day but dont have the urge too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but what if you always feel antisocial postorgasm even if you really like someone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry fatties this works
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why are you jerking to fatties
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why are you not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all your posts are invalid after the nude fiasco
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgallerysvyoc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do people you demand nudes from send them in those dreams
Showerthoughts,not_removed,holy shit dont you own reddit are you gonna revoke my reddit privileges if i dont send nudes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i already have a lot of dreams about events ive had in the past i honestly dont think technology will ever be able to properly nail down dreams though theyre such an abstract surreal concept i just dont think theyre something mankind could properly grasp in that sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is so deep just wow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what
Showerthoughts,not_removed,delet this or ill revoke ur reddit privileges
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill send you to camp if you dont send nudes of yourself to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe someday i heard our memories are all encoded in our brains so we have to figure out how to literally relive our past not just daydream about it so im thinking theyll invent a way to pass out and relive a past day in your life except this time you can play it out differently many will choose sep and stop the bad guys or spend time with a dead relative etc reliving everything exactly how it was not the hasiness of typical dreams
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgallerysvyoc dont act like you dont know what im talking about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well in most of my dreams i have about the past they are usually in what i refer to as my noire world pretty much ill have dreams about the places i grew up or where ive been but the layout of the places will all be cut up and distorted and it will always be night and in black and white most of the time itll be in the middle of a storm as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wtf does that have to do w me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well in this method you would be transported to a time in your life exactly what it was then you can do things different than the first time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because thats your username in the pictures someone tagged your username so you shouldve seen this a long time ago so youre apparently a racist homophobic bigoted child who threatens to kick users off of a website that he doesnt even own lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only parts of the name are obscured in each picture piecing them all together we found out your username despite the ops best efforts oh well sucks to be you better delete your account buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha youre a loser
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lmao wrong guy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you wish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ha no it isnt douche
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we dont need to wish when it became true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jasmine pls send nudes thx
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who r u
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it never became true cuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice try using bad spelling as a distraction
Showerthoughts,not_removed,messaged me about weeks ago begging for nudes think i still have the conversation in my inbox i can always post the screen shots without your name half ass covered after i get off work if you like to prove its you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn you are real delete your account
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds like youre asking me out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you delete yours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no get a life kid lame wannabefunny username

Showerthoughts,not_removed,not even but heres the proof that youre pathetic and full of shit httpimgurcomdelpryo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why havent you blocked him yet also thanks for adding the uncensored pics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know who you are other than you want to be with me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre very welcome i havent blocked him because me might revoke my reddit privileges im scaredha eh this amuses me now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am not sure anyone has a desperation well so deep as to want someone as deluded as you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha that exchange was hilarious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hooray you get
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so why do you want to date me so bad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you sound like a year old kid that tries to be edgy and racist online because you would never say the shit that you post here in real life trust me it wont end well for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so you are asian hahahahaha go back to asia
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt stop being so sensitive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this fact alone should have disqualified rio from hosting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah it just gives you more ads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always feel like the devs somehow keep track of whoever rates it and doesnt rate it and they are silently resenting the ones who dont rate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,usually the increase in ads would come after you give a rating
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to see them in person
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we already know whats going on in one anothers lives if we really wanted to have a bbq or something i think it would happen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this are we really that obsessed with our devices that people dont understand the value of facetoface contact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you wont believe this one weird trick everyones talking about for clickbait fail ftfy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and you never will
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all of ops comebacks are just pure genius so glad i stumbled upon this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,insightful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like eating rice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about those times when you accidentally step on rice with your socks on then a bunch of hair sticks to it then it hardens to stone and you cant get it off your sock ever again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ants can carry that shit on their back can you carry a grain of rice on your back no it falls off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please dont interrupt while i think about a single grain of rice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are the kind of edgy sophistication the world admires
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not sure what to tell you i have only experienced this with boogers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve seriously lost your shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you smoking something other than strawberries
Showerthoughts,not_removed,naplock blubbaing intensifies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dare you i dare you to put a grain of rice on your back walk to work and back with it still there then tell me im wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my grandma gave me this name show some respect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i work from home
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wont judge you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats too bad i really needed a good judging
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then may i direct you to hotornotcom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you may not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are we in love
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we just might but theres another

Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a chaz bono sort of way youre hitting all of my buttons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have the body of a hillbilly on meth and raisin bran
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh my god dont stop dont stop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my smile shines of cheese wiz my hair flows like bear shit in a river
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you do know that different places have different time zones right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im gonna take a wild guess here and sayno
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the entire world being asleep at the same time is as likely as everyone in your entire country being asleep during the middle of the day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,almost certainly like right after we evolved after there were a decent number of us no probably not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yes the first personeverthat would be all of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh yes the first personeverthat would be all of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not sure but there was a particular lucky streak between november and february where nobody died
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that true too lazy to google
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahahaha marry me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could also say that vr is the rich mans sleep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but rich people dont actually sleep in vr do they
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats generally what i do and give them a quick rinse after although most of the time i just let it dangle and dont even touch it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,

Showerthoughts,not_removed,because what depressed people need most is to stay in a constant cycle of depression by feeding off the misery of their peers you could call it suicidebook because thats probably what most of the users would be doing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know but i assume seeing how your friends all seem to have a great life by constantly rubbing into your face that theyre making awsome vacations have fun eat fancy stuff etc is far worst the reality that all of them have problems too is mostly omitted i consider that more dangerous than knowing your friends fuck up too from time to time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know your life or anything so im not sure if this thought comes from personal experience or perspective but either way i find it best not to look at all the awesome things my friends are doing now if i am feeling particularly depressed ive got friends teaching in third world countries others that are pretty nomadic and move between places like alaska and hawaii depending on the season and some that have been really successful in life and are now purchasing vehicles at the age of its really easy to see the good moments of someone elses life and assume that is all there is but there are studies that have actually shown people who post more frequently on social media have a lower self esteem and thus seek gratification through their social media when i do see these posts about awesome things that happen to my friends i try to remember they arent really rubbing it in my face they havent specifically sent me a message saying look at what cool shit i have and you have nothing i remember that they have struggles they face every day as well and that it is probably better that they dont post about every single fucked up thing people who post negative things like that are really just sending out cries for help and i would rather my friends be in a good place than having to worry about them constantly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well its an actual shower thought lol im personally doing pretty ok and am not even close to being depressed its just what i frequently read what made me think of it i have read multiple times that people get upset when they compare themselfs with others which appear more successful in life something along the line of my friend recently good promoted the other is buying a house my childhood crush just married my sister got her first baby and what am i doing i live with my ma and browse reddit all day ive read these kind of post often social media can be cruel anytime good happens to you youre glad to share it when something bad happens you probably dont even want to bother people because you dont want to be that guy who complains about everything and seeks attention even though you might even want to talk to someone because of this facebook instagram etc are mostly about the good things that happen so i thought maybe if people would see the truth that success comes with great struggle and that people are not alone with their problems that they maybe get motivated by it by feeling not worthless a little bit exagerated but rather like anyone else to know thats nothing wrong with you is very reassuring i guess you get my idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unlikely
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it depends since your question is about wisdom you can directly say that younger generation cannot be wiser than older people they can of course be smarter but for example the iq has nothing to do with wisdom wisdom is made out of experiences and not out of intellect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i disagree i think wisdom is understanding the way the world works and so there can be young people who are much wiser than older people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good pointi dont necessarily agree that an older person is wiser than a younger person in some situations one experience may bring more wisdom in one person than multiple experiences in another person so some people could have many experiences in life and still not be as wise as someone younger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this might count for you but the definition of wisdom is that you have intelligence and a lot of knowledge based on your live experience and do not say that a year old has more life experience than a year old of course there are a few but dont generalize
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sure i do not deny that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think you read my comment correctly i never even said the number i said a younger person can be wiser not that they all of them are there was no generalization you just said that by definition a younger person cannot be wiser than an older person and now you are saying there are a few year olds who are wiser than year olds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me a year old is a younger person you did not specify younger person and i just added a random age and i also said that a younger person can be wiser although the definition says that you need a lot of life experience and for me you sounded like you think that in todays society younger people are wiser than older people next time specify your argument or question so everyone can understand you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my argument didnt need specifying in fact it would have made less sense if i had said some year olds can be wiser than older people it would have sounded like i was talking about year olds specifically the fact that you thought i was generalizing or implying that younger people are wiser than older people although i specifically said can be is on your part i cant make sure you read all the words in my argument thats on you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,anyways i think since we think the same we shouldnt argue any longer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well fuck me

Showerthoughts,not_removed,look up german verbs and how they are structured into sentences english is easy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,born in the usa as a native english speaker we were absolutely had charts of irregular verbs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre right german is really difficult to learn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,really i thought most of them were common knowledge because you speak with them all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,native german speaker here we also had to learn them kind of most of them were known to us because of daily use but we still had to learn the rules and exceptions which apply to them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive been doing it all wrong smh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,trying to be like the rest of the world is in itself influencing it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is it though i mean one is legal in public and mildly inconvenient the other is highly illegal and murders families
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the difference between a smoker and a drunk driver is the smoker gives you a chance to move
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i say both of these things but if you walk up and stand next to me while im smoking you can fuck right off if im sitting in a bar and you get pissy you can piss on out the door if im at work and youre standing there as i run a grinder and smoke you can take that shit down the road
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not really a drunk driver is not sober and is a danger for everyone you dont get killed if someone smokes besides you neither you get any cancer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh the smokers are downvoting lmao
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel bad for the pets of cigarette smokers because animals cant speak up for themselves
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except for smoking around people is deadlier than drunk driving
Showerthoughts,not_removed,smokers who smoke in multi dwellings are harming others smokers are harming waiters and bartenders they harm their kids etc a drunk driver may or may not hit you second hand smoke is proven harmful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we found the smoker die of cancer asshole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,look that drunk may or may not kill or hurt someone when they drive kids or others who are privy to second hand smoke like those in apartments or bars get harmed they may or may not get a disease
Showerthoughts,not_removed,smokers who smoke in multi dwellings are harming others smokers are harming waiters and bartenders they harm their kids etc a drunk driver may or may not hit you second hand smoke is proven harmful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre equating dangerous drunken activities to the idea of going up to someone while they are typically outside and saying can you go away please second hand smoke is harmful they know this that is why smokers take their activity outside if you stalk them out of there and still have a problem youre an asshole also youre not listening to anyones side of the discussion i suspect youre just doing this for more attention
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the last days my dog has eaten cat shit rolled in the rotting carcass of a deer and burned most of the hair off his muzzle trying to get a flaming stick out of a fire i dont think second hand smoke is the big goofy bastards number health risk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,drink driving is proven fatal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kids shouldnt be in bars anyone else could vote with their dollars ie choose not to frequent a bar where there is smoking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do they still allow smoking in bars in the us
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if a drunk drivee hits youyou die a most likely gruesome death or you are disabled for the rest of your life you are where i live not even allowed to smoke in public buildings like restaurants and many bars so you aint harm anyone there you shouldnt smoke infront of your kidssame with getting drunk or driving drunk with them on the backseats and also the cliche that every smoker is a selfish person who blows you his smoke in the eyes is not truei cant speak for everyone but when i smoke im not addictedsometimes i smoke for a few months and then not for a year or so i would never do that and never infront of kids and when they walk on the side ways i switch the hand so they wont get it on their fave ect your comparison is rather stupid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre going to quote yourself dont pick such a stupid quote
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people die per year due to second hand smoke people die per year due to drunk driving httpwwwcdcgovmotorvehiclesafetyimpaireddrivingimpaireddrvfactsheethtml so by those numbers it is more deadly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no those people died from automobile exhaust million cars and trucks and you want to blame a few smokers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you asked me to prove that second hand smoke is deadlier than drunk driving i have done so good day sir

Showerthoughts,not_removed,beats of the crap coming down the pipe in this thread p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well see i think once we get some participation it will drop down to around
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hope so noone is looking to participate in this damn thing everyone seems to just be looking to stroke their ego with some instant karma im honestly thinking of giving up on reddit altogether ive deactivated my fb a while ago and the only sub i really participate in is my local town the rest are too shallow to be honest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hi sparsheeeg thanks for submitting to rtifu however your submission tifu by taking my trainer into a security gate has been removed because you have violated one of our rules which can be located in the sidebar rule httpswwwredditcomrtifuwikicommonfuckups feel free to post this in the weekly being embarrassed is a common fuckup please refer to our rtifuwrules our rtifuwsubs list of rtifuwikicommonfuckups before sending us a message if you have any questions we ask that you httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetortifusubjectmy submission was removedmessagei have a question regarding the removal of this directly for appeals
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well to be fair you didnt even bother to post a complete sentence here and youre complaining about how no one else wants to contribute physician heal thyself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im confused
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i didnt say contribute i said participate as in have a discussion build depth etc i also dont think quantity is a sign of quality i think depth is a sign of quality and not as in thats so deep man nor stupid back and forth jokes that thread on for pages as i said maybe reddit just isnt for me because it does seem like thats the kind of stuff that gets the upvotes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you want people to participate you should try to meet them halfway your post here really isnt a good example of how to engage people and if youre chasing upvotes youre missing the point of reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you notice my lack of points over a year period im obviously not chasing upvotes my post is a good example of a thought i had in the shower and thought that this was the place to express it instead i get comments like is that it and a shit post maybe this just isnt the audience i want to engage with or maybe im just missing the point of reddit in general lately back to slashdot it is for random internet discussions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dunno the first few episodes were lol funny at times but season kinda got shitty fast i think the last episode i watched was when the fat guy had a freezer full of something cant remember did i miss anything really

Showerthoughts,not_removed,to make false your above claim
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was a joke dont be a cunt about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i havent ironed a shirt or pair of pants in over years dont let it sit in the machine when wet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never iron any shirts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,😊 bingo this comment doesnt say anything and these arent words

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i actually almost lost the whole side of my finger from the tip top the first knuckle on a restaurant sized can the shitty can opener left it attached in places went to carefully pry it open and next thing i know the side of my finger was hanging by a tiny piece of skin just kinda flapping there luckily it was able to be attached back on and it healed fine so yeah they can get ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i understand that but its level of concern people have that surprises me every time i open can of tuna it feels like im handling a live grenade with how careful people tell me to be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well it seems to work doesnt it

Showerthoughts,not_removed,a solar system by its very nature has a sun at its core and orbiting objects therefore orbiting planets of that solar system most assuredly have a sunrise at some point as the sun visually breaks said orbiting planets horizon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mmmmmm deeeper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sunrise there is only one sun other stars would have other names so they cant really have a sunrise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is only one sun known as the sun in our solar system if you would like to postulate the absence of any other suns outside of our solar system you will have to reword your post you used the the phrase other solar systems which necessarily invokes the presence of other suns the stars central to each solar system to maintain the very definition of other solar systems you can name them what you wish but if they are the central stars of a solar system they are by definition suns
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this isnt a shower tho oh right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ahh nice shower observation if only there was a rule against shit posts like this

Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are only sure that you are truly alive when you can look death in the face smile and give him the finger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if you cant die you arent alive

Showerthoughts,not_removed,but people die when they are killed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and they are alive before that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hotel guy here most hotels that arent at resorts ha e stopped stocking them labour is expensive for the return and the amount of charge backs stale and expired food not to mention how vodka can mysteriously turn into water has led us to abandon the practice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i stayed in a hotel where the power doesnt work unless the key card is in a switch on the wall so i couldnt keep takeaway or keep drinks cold in it there was no point even having the fridge
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bout tree fiddy edit now your edit looks silly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you mean refrigerating overpriced drinks that only the desperate will purchase
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well a mini fridge aint nothin it refrigerates itself after all unless you are being cruel to mini fridgesthen thats different
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lots just lots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtheydidthemath
Showerthoughts,not_removed,currently in thailand and i can confirm at least one as of right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most places turn them off when the room isnt occupied it seems like every hotel i go to i have to crank the temperature knob as cold as it will go for a few hours before using the refrigerator
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually most every hotel fridge ive seen has a minibarsodasnacks etc inside it of course the hotel will charge you if you take any of it what i do is get my own snacks and sodas put the hotels in a cabinet and then put them back in the fridge when i check out that way i get the convenience of using having cold sodas without paying like a can
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder how many adults shat themselves right now excluding elderly and sick people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,omg you had the russian reverse jesus at your hotel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you could get another key card
Showerthoughts,not_removed,many of those will work with any old card shoved in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can stick anything there its just a switch also refrigirators and air conditioners are generally on a different grid
Showerthoughts,not_removed,usually a credit card or your drivers license will work the same so you can keep the lights on charge your pc have the aircon on even if you leave the room
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tree fiddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op didnt mention minibars just fridges which are found in many business level american hotels
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or just stick any card in there i even used a small pamphlet that was handed to me in cancun just fold it so itll fit right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,any hotels not just murican ones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where are the boobs dude
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was expecting to see boobs you are a phony
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i also partly expected boobs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always assume boobs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no stereotypes by definition are inaccurate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,honestly i just dont know what youre trying to say
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eg politicians are all corrupt at least trumps not a politician clearly trump is the best candidate a new study found that bacon is good for your health clearly we should be eating bacon everyday

Showerthoughts,not_removed,battlefield

Showerthoughts,not_removed,no superpowers no jesus know superpowers know jesus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually jesus is god so youd literally be god
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i always wonder about time zones like if you lived on the time zone line and your friend across the street lives in the other time zone so a mom yells at her kid to go to sleep because its and the other mom doesnt yell at her kid for another hour
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you blatantly stole this from comedian joe mande
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats actually kinda funny since i stole it from a michael che special i just watched on netflix did michael che steal it from him and also ive never heard of joe mande
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk but thanks for admitting to the theft
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well im not a professional comedian so its not exactly a big deal but if we uncovered that one pro comedian stole from another one thats actually noteworthy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why did you do it though with no intention of giving credit to your source wouldnt you want to share the things that bring you laughter with others wouldnt you want success for your source
Showerthoughts,not_removed,forget it jake its reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt call it stealing he had nothing to gain but useless karma to gain more like sharing kinda how everyone else on the internet does not that big a deal bud
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait until you realize that you have friends youve known for years then realize you didnt meet them until after you were out of college
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when people teach their young to read at home with love there begets hope for a better future
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i took the gold for bonglifting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tasty meat tube
Showerthoughts,not_removed,spit roasting that thot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if black guys did this to a midget would their dicks touch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called spitroast man the girl is like a pig being roasted on a stick two dicks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe just the second part is true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some will flip and some will flop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and some people really dont care either way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,y is the roullette russian u can say the same thing about non russina roullette
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and your level of game becomes overly lame
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have no shame so therefore ill have no fame
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is there an automatic repost timer for this or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when staying home beats going to the bar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when a night out isnt worth the hangover
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can start to catalogue all the stupid mistakes you used to make not having an emergency fund not paying rent on time at all costs drinking burnetts staying up all night also baby fever starts to kick in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i did today while taking a very wholesome dump
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you is tired you is broke you is adulting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because pants need to fit more precisely in order to by functional
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends where you are all my shirts are bought by collar and chest measurements so its a question of retailer not of industry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you tailor uses measurements to make your pants but not your shirts that is bullshit tell your butler to fire the tailor and find you a new one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but most people still need a belt so its kinda meh anyways i just find it odd that pants need so mush variation in size but shits are pretty generic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmm good point also im referring to t shirts i didnt really think about dress shirts when i posted haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eating turds scratching checking out the trash true bon vivants no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well buddy let me tell you about a movie called homeward bound
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but if you really do think about it you will find that it would be almost impossible to know what thoughs actions are youre better off thinking in larger time frames
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rwallstreetbets is waiting for you senpai
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait did you just say conspiracy theorists are making the smartest conclusions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are plenty of annoying atheists out there but in general i think they try to make rational logical conclusions conspiracy theorists are the complete opposite they take any random piece of data they find and completely twist it around ignoring any sense of logic or scientific process
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes and even if they turn out to be wrong its still preferable to blind faith
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah its the sheeple that really annoy me when its already a proven fact that corruption runs rampant governments constantly get caught discussing planning and attempting conspiracies all the time and yet there are people who think its more likely that there are no conspiracies going on thats mathematically objectively according to hoyle stupid right there what could cause such a fundamental disruption of basic cognizance i mean its not like theres literally something in the water oops wait googled yeah there is well shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that part he asked about
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should follow your own user name
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hundreds if not thousands of universities and backyard scientists have bounced lasers off the reflectors left behind from the moon landings a smart conclusion would be we landed on the moon but conspiracy theorists ignore this or create wild explanations smart conclusions are based upon occams razor conspiracy theorists do the opposite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,preaching to the choir brother the hardest part is those people can be somewhat intelligent but propaganda and conditioning are very powerful tools people with blind faith in corrupt powers are like religious fanatics theyve been taught a bullshit story from birth and they cant remember ever not thinking that way so when you attempt to present an alternative viewpoint they are incapable of receiving it rationally brainwashing is a very real very scientific very powerful method to ensure this kind of fanaticism and thats why it works a child is a blank slate that carries the message of whoever holds the chalk get them believing young and later they will react to any dissenting opinion from a primal instinctive part of the mind all rationality disappears under the flood of adrenalin from righteous rage and you end up with people killing people over beliefs that cant even be scientifically backed up but the key part is to remember that your sheeple arent necessarily stupid its just the machine is real its been there longer than any of us and its followers have perfected their methods over centuries and then what a bunch of intellectually stunted people that really just inherited a fucked system are supposed to just reverse all that in a few decades sadly no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seriously he asked the exact part that is not understood in other words hes is asking if you actually think conspiracy theorists are making the smartest conclusions and i second this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well this is chock full of assumptions and logical fallacies
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but i must politely decline any further interaction with you dude you literally just told this person you arent going to talk to them anymore and then proceed to give them a life lesson on assumptions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess ive been told
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah ill have to retract my earlier statement apparently some of the sheeple really are stupid and do deserve contempt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes as much sense as grouping decades but we do that too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same theres something wrong with us i think it might be add
Showerthoughts,not_removed,glad to know its not just me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this makes no sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no the summer portion of the olympic title describes which group of sports are included which are entirely different than the winter sports not what season it is hosted if it were to be the winter olympics it would have to include the winter sports instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they are summer sports and greece is in summer right now they did make up the olympics thats why they always get introduced first in the parade
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no not in any way its still summertime it just happens to usually be colder than wintertime also the summer and winter olympics happen every years not every six months so the season is unrelated edit shit my b i was taught something wrong at some point tmyk
Showerthoughts,not_removed,brazils winter season is from june til september
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats weird mine arent happy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id still rather have the fast clock being right a couple of times doesnt make it useful
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at least one of us is for real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of course money changes lifestyle duh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,back in the it was tense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ye posted this twice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,where should i own a personal narrative
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unqualified shits is the politest way of calling you all armchair analysts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know that ive ever met a wwii veteran my grandfather was a korean war vet and my dad who remembers bits and peices of wwii he was around is a vietnam vet but dont think ive met any wwii vets thats so weird
Showerthoughts,not_removed,welp i guess is time for another one then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its already normal to not meet a revolutionary war vet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because they are old and dying and children are being born its the passage of time pretty obvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who the hell cares
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bruh clear bandaids also some rich people probably pay an arm and a leg for fancy skintone bandaids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the cape behind them probably throws you off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you dont generally take in the complexities of everyones features your brain simplifies into something you recognise glasses being a large part of that blurry generalisation upsets that profile when removed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if they dont you probably dont need glasses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one does not need to pay for internet electricity water and pretty much any other utilities in most video games
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im aware thats why its odd irl i have things that are actually important but i blow my money but in video games im hesitant with even small purchases
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpiimgurcombdrqdpng
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how the fuck
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my dick is a cold emotionless killer all my passion comes from my hips
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait so what you are saying is that porn isnt real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahah those suckers will only have accessible vr games and porn fucking losers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,usb c takes away all the guess work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aint he dead though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hate the game not the player
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont think that invalidates him in some way robert plant once said in an interview that everybody who claims to do something like make music simply for the love of it is just lying george carlin was self aware as fuck he knew he was part of the system as we all are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ya he dead mhmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i say you he dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i should probably state i like george carlin im just saying what if the secret society living in the shadows created george carlin to rally and pacify a demograph that inevetiably going to formulate in any possible version of society
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on a related issue you can request your personal file from the fbi via a foia request httpswwwfbigovservicesrecordsmanagementfoiparequestingfbirecords
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not every year has days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt a year has days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a year is one orbit around the sun minus of a day which is the of feb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont worry i have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they dont ive counted and this year has wake up people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me too thnks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it all has to do with the earths rotation and how long it takes we didnt get to pick i hope im not missing a meme here im a little rusty on my dank memes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,blame the damned sumerians and then literally everyone between us and them inclusive for not adopting metric time httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexagesimal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats just the mean calendar year an astronomical year is days on average
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who decided how long a second is though or minutes or hours sixty is such an obscure number
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was very interesting thanks stranger
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which means theres hours in a year or about minutes shorter of a year than the usual estimate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me my favorite fictional video game character is princess daisy tell me about yours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my favourite character in the last of us is bill
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jaime lannister from game of thrones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never playedseen last of usjust heard of it so cant comment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes hated but in the books you start to sympathize with him more or at least i did
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh play it then if you like a good story
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do love a good story what genre is it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a linear post apocalyptic survival stealth kind of game if youre easily scared then maybe horror too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is have you heard of the reduced section
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ehh humans dont usually want worms except fishermen ad gardeners the late bird gets to the party and all the worms are already eaten
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i´m a fisherman and dread the summer days when they go to the bottom of the ground cause it´s too hot gotta make your own compost to fix that problem in the summers i guess i need a aquariam full with them breeding now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they did actually its mentioned in creed it happened offscreen d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha yea but thats in reference to the friendly sparring match from the end of rocky iii nothing intense like the first two
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think this is askscience rather than shower thought but here is the answer what we call light is just photons we experience light by coming in contact with these photons and inside of a black hole would surely have a lot of photons the problem is that these photons cannot escape the singularity due to its massive gravity so none of these photons can actually come to you and for that reason it would still be completely dark assuming you are stationary
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only if there is an infinite light source inside the event horizon this may be possible we dont know what matter does when it enters the singularity but its most likely not infinite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive wondered that too where does it go does it make it through and to wherewhen or does it transform those things are so stinking mysterious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lots of crushed light and other matter mixed and compressed would probably still be black because black is the absence of colour
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my favorite interpretation of the inside of a black hole is the white hole that leads to its own pocket universe theory
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt that circular logic though by that i mean assuming one could magically exist inside the singularity how would the space in front of you appear if you space photons every sub atomic particle is under the same crushing force of gravity wouldnt every particle in effect be drawn towards each other by effect of everything not being able to overcome the singularity like if a fat person were sleeping in a water bed and a potatoe chip and a ball of candy fell off of their stomach by the depression of the bed the standin for spacetime in this example bending into this persons girth the chip and ball would invariably be drawn towards each other while falling under this persons weight affecting the bed theyre in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the massive light would already be a part of th e singularity and therefore you moving towards the singularity would not allow you to have contact with photons if you could stop the time and just go through the black hole you would see the time itself what you would see in singularity is kind of a whacky question with no answer for all we know you will see unions having sex thats because we literally have no idea even photons wont survive that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol i can relate and he keeps telling me why are you not talking and i am like i am thinking what should i talk about but why dont you say something meanwhile and he replies i am thinking too d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes and sadly it is accepted now literally whatever the hell that means lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gonna tell this to my pastor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats a presbyterians
Showerthoughts,not_removed,doesnt look like anything to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a stopped clock could be stopped every hour on the hour but never right at any point throughout the day however a broken clock is right twice a day everyday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so is a broken clock running
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or perhaps youre squeezing multiple people into a picture and everyone wont fit otherwise
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fixed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it goes into affect at am
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no am in your local time zone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what about morning wood surely pissing with a hardon is near the top
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they may call it yogurt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we call it στραγγιστό stragisto strained yogurt greek salad is χωριάτικη choriatiki village salad
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyve probably never heard of it like canadian bacon p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what do they call regular yogurt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yoghurt is how its spelled outside usa and canada
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even in canada we know of canadian bacon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i honestly thought it was a typo because you hit a bump or something while typing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when i lived there we called it ham
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha i always keep watch for them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ham is different canadian bacon is peameal bacon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what makes it canadian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no idea what makes french fries french
Showerthoughts,not_removed,after trying to use windows for about minutes i turned the computer off and installed linux on it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i actually like windows after you turned off the awful automatic update system its pretty decent bit as the last windows version i had was vista i guess i didnt have high exeptetions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess im a passionate driver
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why are you thinking about your dad in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe youre both assholes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair you were that before you shouted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no one cares angry nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre shouting at other people playing video games its the same thing esports but if youre yelling while playing its reminiscent of a player yelling at a ref which is enough to get you thrown out in most sports
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cheering and screaming in anger arent the same thing one of them increases enjoyment the other shows you lack control
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes the angriest gamer you ever heard hes the angry atari sega nerd hes the angry video game neaaard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,majority defines what is right few generations down the line you will be the passionate player
Showerthoughts,not_removed,someone has daddy issues
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im a very passionate fapper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and one of you is actally playing the game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wrong youre both idiots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,peace is a lie there is only passion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can be a very passionate league of legends player
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if theres anything ive learned over the past two years its that the sort of person who soapboxes about angry nerds ruining nerd culture is a parasite that has latched themselves onto the culture in the hopes of becoming a cultural authority and has no real interest in it and should be ignored until they move onto some other culture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reminds me of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no youre also showing your passion for video games doesnt make you any less angry though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont see how people shout at any of this stuff its completely illogical ive never shouted at a game because i know it wont do anything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at least when you tell during video games its something you can potentially changesolve as opposed to sports where the tiny men in the box cant hear you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,video gaming is nerdy video gamers are nerds people really need to start getting used to what we are much like athletes are jocks we are nerds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am going to definitely repeat that quote to my parents
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i do both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sooooyou play clash royale
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre both nerds
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i see what youre saying but is this wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if your shouting at sports on tv your an angry sports fan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its cuz you got pwnedd newwwwwwwbbbb
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the video game demon is real
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your dads an angry nerd too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds less like a shower thought and more like a well known fact
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds about right yeah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take it easy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what am i when i shout at a sports video game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well to be fair hes just watching a sport not playing one then again shouting at a pro csgostream might be considerd wierd too i hate people who yell into their mics in a game lmao
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an angry videogame nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have a good point its where someone would say something to me if i was bitching about a game i was playing but when tens of thousands of people go to the fucking game and will boo scream yell pout and get mad if their team loses its okay honestly you cant change it as a fan youre there to watch the game gamers are there to play it most games you can control what happens so sports fan are more in the wrong then gamers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to be fair your dad is watching the very best in the world competing and screwing up youre just getting angry at normal people getting stuff wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre a passionate nerd but its possible to be both
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the salt levels are off the charts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sports are a thing that people do in real life video games are literally nothing go fuck yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so youre saying that youre an angry video game nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its because in this day and age nerds are the only culture its pc to make fun of
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless is league then you are showing your passion for the sport and you are an angry nerd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea gotta love them double standards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just upvoted to
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think its weird that guys get so angry at things they supposedly love so much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the following idea grow up and stop playing video games also you have smelly farts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its different because youre likely shouting at other people who can hear you and are shooting back in real time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate people in bars yelling clapping and any form of interacting with the game on tv shut up watch it make comments to yourself or your buddy next to you at a normal volume
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no one cares its just a joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its hard not to be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,watch where your going to stupid baboon faced ass dangling nugget
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my mom never swears she doesnt like rrated movies and doesnt talk about inappropriate things however when shes behind the wheel she swears and it is so funny to hear that stuff come out of her mouth because it is so unlike her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plot twist didnt actually think of this in the shower post removed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just when i think about kissing dads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont ask questions you dont want the answers too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,probably
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the truth hurts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rroastme
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry mum
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you smart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not premier league football
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre insinuating his father is only cheering in both situations it can be positive or negative
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they both show a lack of control calm down its just a game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how about just nobody shouts at inanimate objects ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think sports will still be a big deal in the future
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it doesnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay please note that i am not liable for any punishment may this include spankings technology bans or groundings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell no cant stand mobile games
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that dads name albert einstein
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but youre actively involved in the video game some being very competitive watching a sport on tv you are not actively involved
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget the fights and riots
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bad reasoning but okay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if youre yelling at proleague
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your dad is watching the very best in the world competing and screwing up people yell at the detroit lions all the time best in the world my ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i fuck myself every night mate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,grow up stop using reddit as a form of entertainment go work and clean and do nothing that may give you even slightest bit of entertainment in your free time dumb reasoning right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no one listen to this im getting a degree in game design i spend a lot of my time playing games but also have a fiancee and son game playing and adulthood are not mutually exclusive dont shame people for doing something they enjoy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but your dad doesnt know that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whats just a joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mean thats kinda the joke
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh trust me no appropriate words are used here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dear ufrizzin your has been removed for the following reasons ¯ツ¯ we respect your right to have questions or concerns about this issue i am not a bot and this action was performed manually if you have questions good for you we all have questions
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its okay i think about my dad in the shower but i was just asking because maybe you think about your dad for the same reasons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,take a shower angry need
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not insinuating shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont enjoy yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as a software developer scolding my computer helps me stay sane
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do you not live
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im curious where in the world you live in where this isnt the case
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op how old are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont get me wrong i love video games more than i like sport i have no problem with people enjoying games im just saying there two are not exactly the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fair enough
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you for explaining the humour friendo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i saw this in my inbox and actually thought my post was removed lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think about your dad in the shower too utakesthewrongsideguy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,chill your dill buddy what were you trying to say then because that was how i took it and still do after rereading it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mummy tells me not to give out my age on the internet
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wise ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love both as well im a bit biased for extreme sports over games though but it still is bad reasoning to be honest deep down theyre both the same the sole purpose of sports and games is recreational entertainment with sometimes a bit of competitvism thrown in imagine youre the player on the football field you miss this super easy gamewinning shot and you get angry you rage on yourself for failing and losing now imagine a dude in csgo or something missing a super easy gamewinning shot you rage on yourself for failing and losing see theres almost no difference other than the type of game being played
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well yeah its illegal for me to have a sex life at the age im at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the joke that op uses inappropriate language when driving hadnt been made yet you could see the joke coming but i actually made it thats kinda the thing dont be upset

Showerthoughts,not_removed,you realize he is a video game character
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is a noob showerthought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you cant be bothered to do basic research or apply a bit of thought i have no sympathy for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is reddit for then hmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this statement has already been posted a million times maybe use the search and save us all some time or i dunno theres this site called google you might want to try dipshit

Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not asking noob questions i just see so many and they are replied very harsh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a giant circlejerk of established internet common knowledge
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am not the one asking these questions must be hard to have to insult someone because you cant think dipshit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,internet common knowledge see
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whoosh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,might be showing some cynicism after here expecting the new gen got the memo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what xd

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i had a volunteer job arranging shelves and i got in trouble for being too slow i wasnt even being paid so nice thought but probably will not work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as an overnight grocery store stockercashier everyone who does this job has some level of ocd its kinda like building a house in minecraft at a certain point your brain knows something is wrong and it has to be fixed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lmao their worst fear ppl consistently fucking up what they need to be perfect
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have a feeling ocd people would drive themselves crazy stocking shelves because depending on what kind they had theyd spend literally hours arranging and rearranging the same product on a shelf and then panicking as soon as a customer touched it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is a special place in hell for countries which have tipping instead of a decent minimum wage ftfy

Showerthoughts,not_removed,i hate tipping why do i have to personally pay the restaurant staff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if i get shitty service i think to myself this person doesnt care about the job enough to get tipped
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i work at starbucks anyone who doesnt tip is congruent to satan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ok special place for those who do not tip when the service was decent or more than outstanding
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you work at starbucks thats the bigger problem here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldoccasionally do tip at starbucks but times out of the service is crap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people still pay so much for coffee
Showerthoughts,not_removed,could you be more specific so that i am able to fix whatever mistake i have made or are you simply stating that my statement is wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hes saying people shouldnt have to make a living based mostly on the generosity of others
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if you live in a country where employees of a restaurant get a decent wage
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its actually a pretty good company to work for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if they dont make enough on tips to exceed minimum wage then their employer must pay them the minimum wage for their state
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this comes from me being a post mates driver and not getting tips i shall edit it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,debatable i recently left for some pretty shitty reasons ive worked for better companies that actually take care of their employees
Showerthoughts,not_removed,uh oh i hope nothing terrible happened i have been to other stores in my district where the managers arent as cool but my store is super close
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this isnt new
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this has always been a thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ass acne assne
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they have remedies for that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never knew that haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just not this one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hopefully not these olympics though especially if theyre judging our hygiene
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha as long as they dont see the water sports i think well be ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats when you buy blackout curtains
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or eye covers you could also get fog lights and troll the people by shining the light at them even in the morning i used to have a good view of a couple lecture halls so i would use a lazer pointer and telescope to point it at the profs teaching never got caught 😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats absolutely hilarious i should do that 😂
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you ever watched a silent film
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same thing for blind people they wouldnt know the sound is from a video just as the deaf person wouldnt know one of the videos lacked sound
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same for dead people i guess
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think blind people with hearing can hear the difference between a video audio and real life audio p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and coma patients
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a lot of people are glad they grew up in a time where all of their teenage stupidity wasnt recorded forever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why i check the on this day every day to clean up my dumbass posts from years ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyll never talk to me again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youll get there dont feel discouraged
Showerthoughts,not_removed,women cant live with em cant live without em
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well uhhhh theres nosulus rift
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some eateries actually use certain ingredients for scent appeal like when you go to the fair and you want to spend bucks on some deep fried snickers its cause you have been bamboozled into thinking your hungry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ultimate immersion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,eyes wouldnt be screens they would be a camera and the ears would be a microphone the mouth is a speaker the nose is a trumpet duh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ever been to a theater
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the smellascope from futurama
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know if this really belongs here but i thought about it in the shower after my dinner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait the opening theme or the imperial march
Showerthoughts,not_removed,brb getting chips so i can chomp along
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what a unique shower thought just like all the other unique ones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,would take forever to load the page unless connected to wifi unfortuently
Showerthoughts,not_removed,buzzfeed does that its terrible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,filthy muggles they prefer clickbait lmao
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some news accounts online already do theyre called gifs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,get outta here with that autoplay bullshit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that would scare alot of old people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because it would suck ass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gifspaper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so many meaningless gifs would piss me off looking at you buzzfeed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,webm video is small
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel your pain and theyre so useless too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wait until my father hears about this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell with them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,reddit we invented the gifspaper
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea fuck em get with the times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and here i waste my lucid dreams summoning endless watermelons and then sleeping within my dream to see what happens spoilers i just woke up instead c
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would get dated real quick
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would hate that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jokes aside no no it shouldnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure theyre the same person i cant think of a time ive seen them together
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aziz ansari is way more talented
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because it would suck i dont know i like them both separately but that just seems like a really forced pairing to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,here please take this upvote can someone give them a call to find out another night awake trying to solvd mysteries
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youve never seen me with either of them i am aziz ansari and kevin hart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,american isnt a race
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or a human option
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless youre a native american
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a nice idea but you conflated race and nationality they actually arent the same thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your nationality would be asian chinese japanese east indian but your race could still be caucasian
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its ok i get where youre coming from
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i get that feeling occasionally often right as im falling asleep eyes closed i see something coming at me and i suddenly sit straight up in bed i hadnt been dreaming but neither had i been completely awake its strange to say the least
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me it usually feels like im tripping and jump up before i fall
Showerthoughts,not_removed,happens to me all the time its like for a split second youre somewhere else about to react to something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i usually see pavement as i trip too i had spinal surgery when i was all night as a consequence of the painkillers i had oh gods im fallingtrippingbeing crushed by a bookcase dreams all night which was less than fun because i jumped awake each time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh my god i pictured this and just seems horrible sorry man
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was pretty off my face so it didnt hurt as much as it should have mainly i was just entirely convinced it was all real at the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they probably had you all medicated out on percocet and hydros
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who cares what your signature looks like
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is not a palindrome all my dates are iso certified these days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,americans why didnt they post this in june its not june today rest of the world that makes perfect sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its also my birthday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if youre in candyland sure
Showerthoughts,not_removed,by the way you were the first to post this on here as far as i can see cant wait to see the flood of reposts coming soon

Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh i finally get it usa usa 🎉🍔🍔🍔🌭🍟🍟🍕
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wish you posted this earlier in the day so people could enjoy it damn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in the usa its just another day
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are just days late shhh we are going to pretend it shouldnt be
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well happy birthday

Showerthoughts,not_removed,looks at calendar damn im lost out here haha youre right sorry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im lost out here half the time as well so i feel ya
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aliens are music
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can try but most people will probably decline i think there was actually still a law that meant you could duel to contest almost anything until recently when some guy challenged someone to a duel over a parking ticket or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i second this post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in a couple of countries you have the right to a trial by combat a few years ago a man in the uk was given a ridiculous parking ticket to show just how stupid that ticket was he requested a trial by combat which was denied by the judge
Showerthoughts,not_removed,socialites related to the oj trial thats why
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually there are many reasons why the kardashians are famous robert kardashian the father was a friend and lawyer of oj simspon during the trial kim was a friend of paris hilton i believe which spun off into the infamous sex tape we know of today and because they have datedmarried other people with fame kim is also a successful entreprenur correct me if im wrong about any information
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more power to them for making it im a capitalist just making a joke more than a complaint or rant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre riding the coat tails of his stardom by him i mean oj thats like a movie extra suddenly getting famous
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you are correct with everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually kris is the only one who is riding on the coat tails and shes managed to build a name for the entertainment industry as shes a manager for her kids but also different musical groups the three oldest kim kourtney and khloè all have makeup lines clothing lines i know that kim has a perfume and they have a global app the industry is all about who you know more than half of the stars out today are famous by pitching a show to someone they know who knows an agent who knows someone else no one is self raised anymore just because the kardashians have made a brand for themselves and are surviving after all these years is rooted in jealousy let them be rich in la who are they hurting why does everyone hate on them they dont do anything bad i honestly hear their names more by people complaining than i do in everyday life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,id end up eating the whole bottle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do it its a winwin situation you get candy your body gets vitamins
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what you read is bad egg in a hen house full of hundreds of thousands of eggs welcome to american media controversy sells happy fun times does not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the more you read and play the more you gonna portray
Showerthoughts,not_removed,heres a link to further explain httpunderscoopfirecomhowtosurvivepostsunburnitch i am trying a few ideas from here
Showerthoughts,not_removed,um cortisone cream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wife is on way to store now currently jumping up and down with towel on my back not helping losing my mind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dude ive tried this is not something ive ever had before and i wouldnt wish it on my worst ninja enemy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kind of aside from the difference between plucking a string and hitting it there are still other differences for instance a piano especially in the upper register uses more than one string for each note also there are even less strings on a harp because pedals are used to raise or lower them by half steps and in terms of the tone the pianos body creates a lot of resonance giving it a very different timbre those are the major differences that come to mind but many other subtle ones are important as well edit clarification
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mostly because you couldnt sleep on the warm bed u fell asleep in the cold class
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would kill to fall asleep on one of those
Showerthoughts,not_removed,plus the fact your bedroom is silent compared to a classroom during lecture
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this never actually happened to me except on a mind journey or however you call those fantasy trips you occasionally do in class
Showerthoughts,not_removed,alternate reality
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apparently you dont really know any elderly people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just getting ready for the next step
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not always worked with a couple of bitchy old ladies in their at a soup kitchen they ran the cooking area and treated all the kitchen help terrible when i met a couple of elderly people in that neighbor hood who had gone to high school with the kitchen ladies i found out they were mean girls in highschool and very bitchy their whole lives getting old did not mellow them out at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,bill cosby is waiting for his innocence to return
Showerthoughts,not_removed,multiple used to convey a pregnant pause not just a rest or breath lie a comma almost like awkward
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theyre ellipses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no i think its pretty weird too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is a legitimate use of punctuation theres no reason texting or comments should be any different than printed books
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ever see a tv show where a telegram was being dictated and instead of the word period they said the word stop morse code and all the dot dot dash stuff you are just of the new age but your symbology represents your ancestry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how many months pregnant though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its determined by how many periods there are which is actually the opposite of how that normally goes when you think about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op asked if theyre the only one answering no implies that you agree with them you mean yes they are the only one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have no idea how much sense this doesnt make yet it makes all of the sense 😳im scared
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if the crystal skull vodka wasnt so expensive and crappy i would totally buy that bottle asap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because the livestock feed the superior species humans abusing pets gives no benefit ill take your bait
Showerthoughts,not_removed,horrible death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dogs and cats coevolved with humans to be our hunting partners and pest control livestock coevolved to be our food we kill them to feed us and our pets if we stopped killing the livestock humans could live on but our quality of life would decrease but our carnivorous pets cats and dogs could not live without it as they no longer hunt for their own survival they depend on humans to feed them if we stopped killing livestock we would be abusing or carnivorous pets by starving them to death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pupper patties sound good to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,found the vegan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there is also no benefit in abusing livestock still it happens every day see here for instance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fullyconscious chicken get their throat slit pigs getting abused during stunning which also a lot of times doesnt work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not asking to stop killing them just to do it properly and on a less bigger scale we then had the time to do it humane
Showerthoughts,not_removed,actually im not there are ways of killing livestock humane the problem is that its not done correctly in huge slaughterhouses because of the sheer mass we have a local butcher who does everything from upbringing to slaughter and processing himself he takes the time to make sure the animals are actually unconscious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how would you suggest they are killed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the cone method is actually pretty useful you do not have to deal with a frantic chicken and afterwards you just leave it there for a few for the blood to drain i used to just grab there heads and swing them in a circle and pop the neck seriously though i do not believe in pushing a hurt cow around with a forklift like you see on animal cruelty tv commercials as for small animals i have personally raised for slaughter it is just the quicker the better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why researchers are making the cultured meat spend you time better by donating money to them as thats the only way that these animals wont be tortured is when we dont need to kill them period because we can just grow the meat in a lab
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you ever been to a slaughterhouse and seen how its done or are you basing this off of secondhand accounts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dead is dead what does it matter how the animal is being killed i am against animal cruelty but these animals were bred for the sole purpose of feeding humans
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tough question for now the methods arent the real problem still need to be changed but the performance is in slaughterhouses they dont take the time to do it properly as a suggestion do it like in the old days with chickens for instance you petted them they got completely calm and there head was just chopped of in a matter of not even seconds no fear for the animal no suffering but as slaughtering is an industry profit is the rule no and thats the problem
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i admit i havent but a friend of mine worked there and i see no reason to question his depiction especially as it is almost identical with what others describe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i say we have the slaughterhouses above a large cliff with a massive hinged trapdoor so we can give cows a free skydiving experience and just blame gravity afterwords while shrugging our shoulders
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a friend of mine works at a slaughterhouse and says its a wonderful magical place
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if a law made suicide punishable by death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,paraphrase of a reshitpost
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah theyd misidentify it as cancer or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not neccessarily they can all be used as a farewell but these days its not so common for the first three
Showerthoughts,not_removed,stopped buying games with season passes for this reason read i dont play video games anymore because of this horseshit editstopping to stopped
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fuckin expansion packs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont have a serious problem with this as long as the other isnt required to complete the game otherwise rage quit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can someone explain this i have not seen this the games i buy are and any dlc is just a bonus for example gta v pokemon x rocket league
Showerthoughts,not_removed,logic does not check out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what first of all what in the world are free hotels second of all why would you want to move houses every day that would be such a hassle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like hotels without a fee so you can explore places and countries without any hesitation because life is not about staying its about moving and exploring well its just my imagination surely it wont happen haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant see how that would be beneficial to most anyone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this sounds suspiciously like what someone might say about doing crack
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but where do you stop when do you say no more fortunately my cat wont let us have another i appreciate that about her
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont take my cat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats how i got up to seven cats a few years ago i found homes for three of them and one died i feel stable at three cats but i would never say i would not take one in again if its cold or hurt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you should see my scratch marks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my cat is the same way i asked her if we could get another cat and she stopped talking to me for a week
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i did actually bring a kitten home once ill never forget the way my cat woke me up in the night stared directly into my soul and without breaking eye contact pissed directly on the carpet for the first and only time in her adult life didnt even matter i was only minding that kitten for the shortterm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thator monopoly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,have you ever played monopoly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i guess you havent seen the news lately with all the mass shootings
Showerthoughts,not_removed,monopoly is the second
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats why i hope san andreas fault will hit san fran the hardest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks buckaroo btw why was that watermelon there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,good for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except photoshop exists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,jesus was born in bce which means before the common era which is a way of marking time combining multiple calenders
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because romanmadegodlike jesus in bible is not real life jesus better use before current era bce and current era ce now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,¯ツ¯
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because in fairy tales everything is possible
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know its all made up hopefully this shower thoughts is solved nothing dealing with religion makes sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well then in just the bc calendar how can he be born in bc but then ad be the beginning of jesus life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well why does everyone use the bc calendar then is it bc or bce
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the bc calendar isnt a thing that exists
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its ce
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because the calendar date back in greek time then roman changed it along with the bible again the bible jesus isnt the same with historical jesus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wow i love you thank you god bless amen jesus christ
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im drunk and eating stale cheese isz thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so in your examples with extra backslashes did you type of them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so then why does bc appear everywhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it doesnt it just appears in christian literature and not even all of that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they do know at least
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can confirm am looking at screen at work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ooh ooh ooh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i still love getting mail the kind that arent bills
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is that tylers paradox
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just pile it up behind my pc screen and sort through it like once a year lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same thing with getting on the scale
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i love mail from friends anything that has my adress printed in a clear view window is fire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,during summer i compost the lot and in winter may use it to start a fire
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was all about getting those cards from relatives around your birthday you knew there was money inside of those cards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes yes it is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if theyre bills you need to pay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that certainly helped
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i pay all my bills online so not much worries there ill open the doctor mail as quickly noticeable pretty much leave the rest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh nice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,steam still requires putting in cd keys
Showerthoughts,not_removed,swing and a miss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he paid for pc games in the aughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,medium aged gamers will never know the pain of having to find word on page of the manual and then being angry because the copy protection only works for the english version of the manual not for the finnish
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol i def remember this original watercraft did this i believe
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,today i am thankful i do not have a stuffy nose however i am sad i live on the east coast of florida right now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nope i take some nasal decongestion medication and then dont have a runny nose anymore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the variation on this is if you get a stuffy nose a lot get a turbinate reduction billed by your ent as completely safe and end up with you realize you really took the stuffy nose for granted
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like when youre in someone elses house at trying to get more cocaine in your sinus
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how did you mentioning being in the first year of university help with your explanation
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this question needs to be answered
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pie spice idk man people seem to love it never bothered to try it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a good question matter of taste i suppose me i love apple my wife loves pumpkin i can take it or leave it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,starbucks marketing and the cultural designation of basics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most everything pumkin like can go die but pumkin pancakes fuck yes give me that dirty goodness
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was this translated from vietnamese or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,pain is there for a reason people would have vastly extended recovery periods andor die as a result of this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not really your birthday unless youre a time traveler
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as was played up pretty well by travoltas character in phenomenon alongside brent spiner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was always told i wasnt another year older until after the exact time i was born i was born at pm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well technically its your birthday on midnight in the timezone of the day you were born unless you want to get precise then its not your birth hour until the exact hour you were born is in the time zone you were born
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt that obvious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats very funny ive never seen that movie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not everyone lives in the same timezone they were born in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,didnt see it that way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless they know that i know
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like to think any kind of villian could do this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think it mostly has to do with positioning
Showerthoughts,not_removed,staying up later than usual here as well
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a different format of fallacy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure that sleeping space will be an advancement in a lot of selfdriving cars not for a long time though theyll have all these laws early on about how you have to be alert while a computer is driving for you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can only imagine what that would cost considering the cost of a new motorhome today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder how much this would impact domestic airline travel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if there is plentiful renewable energy selfdriving motor homes will replace traditional housing for a lot of people maybe not in big cities but in most places why have a house and car if you have a house car
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how has noone tagged uelonmuskofficial in this yet if this isnt the plan for the model y ill be very disappointed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive got an awd minivan i took the seats out and put in a king size bed drive to work nap at lunch road trip on weekends its great
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or what about automated rvs for overnight commutes between cities want to spend the weekend innyc but you live in chicago hop in a pullman rv and wake up rolling into the city or how about automated rv tours
Showerthoughts,not_removed,woah woah were getting on the wrong track fewer paved roads less dependence on high technology give people back their jobs as coach drivers horse trainers all is well ill shovel manure all day every day just give me a dry barn with a washbasin and im all set
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if in the future we live in giant towers that can move their floors across the city on rails that would be dope
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youll always wake up at the dmv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think theres a bed in the latest selfdriving semi
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you will just be bringing back the highway robbers haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is it possible to sleep on a motorhome my buddies i rented an rv in our and that motherfucker was bouncing like crazy it was scary cooking drunk high too lucky no one died
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you have a big car you can lay a mattress in the back and sleep on there
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and then human traffickers will hack your car and abduct you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think youre on to something once we dont have to be alert for it the better cars will have comfy couches or beds as well as deluxe entertainment systems
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is how they take over you fall asleep in them they have a little smirk and drive you off a cliff one by one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,self driving cars are going to be held to a ridiculous standard starting out within years every major auto maker will have the option available within years potentially every new car will have it standard in theory years from now of the cars will have self driving capability some people will figure out that choosing the manual option allows you take risks the other cars wont while exploiting the autobreaking features knowing you can cut people off and their cars will have to stop within years legislation will be proposed for higher regulation on manual drive modes it wont pass initially but eventually it will after the data proves selfdriving vehicles the safest option the big downside darwin has one fewer tool to thin the herd
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like in minority report the people are just lounging while their car goes straight up at insane speeds there were vertical highways iirc
Showerthoughts,not_removed,deluxe entertainment systems people treat them like that anyways
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just took out a patent for this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how they gonna take over like that theyd have to die to kill you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was with you until the last sentence everyone has lapses of judgement now and then or moments where they get slightly distracted should the car with a family who went through a green light and then got tboned by a red light running truck going mph be considered a good thing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,flying is waaaaay more efficient than driving i say that as someone who loves to drive
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a fully loaded has basically the same mpgperson as people in a prius
Showerthoughts,not_removed,while youre sleeping the car will eject you off a cliff it would stay alive but youd be dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that didnt stop kamikazes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til i always thought that it was less efficient simply due to the higher speed leading to an exponential increase in air resistance over cars on the highway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,self driving cars are not susceptible to most forms of traffic blocks wouldnt make a difference
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the selfdriving cars are still built by humans though even if they became selfaware theyd be relying on the human engineers to build in ways for them to eject you like selfcontrolled doors what we really need to worry about is the second generation selfdriving cars the ones that were built by the nowsentient first generation with these humankilling tools in mind
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they didnt win or take over
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre right in that one factor mph vs is waaaay more surface and shape friction thing is a car carries one or two people usually whereas a big jet carries people the equation would be mpg x people plus modern planes are pretty fuel and time efficient turbines need almost no down time they run from here to there non stop few break downs or maintainence tear downs the airline industry is all about efficiency
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they can apparently be produced on rshowerthoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i can reproduce a turd just about anywhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes you could technically be cloned
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are lab mice
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hows the meth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,checks out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sadly i think generations from now there will still be very few people living in space thats only years and although im sure we will have a small colony on mars by then i still dont think the economics will work out to make it a good home
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtitlegore
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nah theyll probably be too busy trying to watch ultraporn i dont even know if i have a greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandfather let alone care about where he lived
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea but i can only put so many greats in the title without having people go onto the next page of reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yea but washington probably has greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandchildren and shit having one of your grandfathers be americas first president isnt shit that anyone would ever forget all i gotta do is do something very important or so completely fucking stupid that i get remembered for something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its all good i appreciate the spirit of your post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you i appreciate you appreciating my spirit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you wouldnt be saying that if you were around before it happened
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i like to pluck mine out and put them on toilet seats just so people see a super long pube
Showerthoughts,not_removed,on the contrary op pubes are just short genital beards
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same exact texture too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some men can grow thick pubes but not thick facial hair i wonder if anyone ever experiences the opposite
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hmm hmmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no because hes off duty on personal hours and isnt a result of his job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lets be honest he probably doesnt have much else to be stressed out but work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the amazing thing is when you actually watch a broadcast channel with advertising now and wonder how you could have watched all that crap years ago and how some people can cope with actually paying to watch that crap on cable it took me two ad breaks to stop watching broadcast tv again and refuse to ever watch it again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so youre basically saying you missed all of the superbowl commercials
Showerthoughts,not_removed,years without here visiting my parents and seeing commercials is so weird even surfing on a computer without an ad blocker is weird who would have thought annoying the fuck out of people is a good way of selling crap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same but i still listen to talk radio so hearing commercials is still a thing i would prefer to go away kindly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,internet tv and memes are all i need
Showerthoughts,not_removed,except for all that in program advertising
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the one time i wanted to watch commercials superbowl fox sports go doesnt show themim watching thru roku app
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but how do you know which kind of auto insurance to buy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i havent seen cable tv commercials in so long im always shocked by the new movies in theaters
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never even watch tv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no commercials is awesome if you have kids
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this was me when i deleted facebook i think instagram is next and i would eventually love to cancel my cable
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what is terrible is when people say oh did you see that great commercial no then they look at you all awkward like you watch tv dont you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then came superbowl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,only reason i got back cable after not having it for two years is that when i called comcast to get cheaper internet after they jacked me up the only way to get it cheaper was to add cable back on the bill still dont watch it but am always amazed going to my parents house and seeing all those damn commercials it just irritates the heck out of me similar to when im somewhere that doesnt have adblock the ads are just obnoxious
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive been without cable tv for years same with stationary telephones i only need internet and a good android tv box with kodi and other apps no adds no random lucky opportunities or other silly offerings on the phone etc couldnt be happier
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rnotinteresting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which only ever have two or three good ones
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shhhhh dont tell him about stranger things
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the good ones will probably be on youtube soon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,annoying the fuck out of people people get numb to it still effective somehow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just upgraded my serous radio so i can listen to the faction talk show it moved onto its own channel i had to pay more for the upgrade and it has a bunch of commercials now im pissed about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,white trash rates from a army guy here is a penguin dont know why﻿
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seriously i just call them all and ask if theyre the one with the british gecko and may i speak to him
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i consider it neglect if you expose your children to excessive advertising though youre the one who has to pay for it literally advertisers know how to make kids bug their parents relentlessly about garbage toys i have two kids who barely know what a commercial is and they rarely ask for random crap they saw on tv
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and it would have made an amazing music video
Showerthoughts,not_removed,all i can think about is her ass being spanked by paddles certainly does sound amazing to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just see her ass with a tennis ball between her cheeks twerking on a table
Showerthoughts,not_removed,an easier way to say that is that someone has an accent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think you have it backwards everybody has an accent
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres also the possibility that were the only intelligent species currently in the universe and by the time weve died out a new race in a whole other galaxy takes up our mantel as the smartest species edit i posted the wrong link this is the right one here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsnhhvqgsmec
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this seems pretty accurate but if they left they mist have had some pretty good technology to get themselves off of earth and you would think there would be some remains of it because if we went extinct most of our things would stay behind and we would have left a huge mark on the entire planet but the aliens in your story did no such thing i know it could have been wiped out by the big bang or something like that but to me it just doesnt add up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,edit i posted the wrong link ok that makes more sense anyway thats a depressing thought were the first and will never see life on other planets
Showerthoughts,not_removed,now thats just a theory but yh its possible were the first intelligent species
Showerthoughts,not_removed,even worse is that were the last surviving intelligent species
Showerthoughts,not_removed,congratulations you discovered supply and demand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because it doesnt exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,every shit you take ill be watching you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i only film my interesting poops
Showerthoughts,not_removed,read this as people film every shit they take—the supernatural part took me off guard
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats because once everybody started carrying ubiquitous phones with builtin cameras nessie bigfoot and the aliens among us went into hiding camera crews and paparazzi are such a pain can you blame them who needs that headache
Showerthoughts,not_removed,op wants supernatural shit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wouldnt be so certain about that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the one thing ive learned from cops is that everybody has a shady cousin willing to loan a stolen car full of drugs
Showerthoughts,not_removed,easier lie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,academic probation unfortunately was the ignition under my ass i needed get serious about my life pretty sad but how i kind of grew up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same desire here i gave no shits when i was in community college now i want to pursue a real education in something im passionate about and its a tad more difficult at
Showerthoughts,not_removed,adam sandler does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just looked up click and read the plot so disappointed in myself i will stay under the shower till i drown
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the ability to make comedy movies without any effort or jokes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was gonna say the plot for the movie click but those are basically the same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exact same thought lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,since this is reddit then quite probably so
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats my first time on chan i was expecting swastikas everywhere
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im not sure if im understanding this post which is my bad regardless may kind of help answer the question start at if you want to only hear about the thought subject id reccomend watching the whole video though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the answer is no evidence fact is a board that has a hardcoded rule that no post can read the exact same in the above picture i asked on the board the question i wonder if any one else has had this same thought before and no one else wrote it so no one else thought of it if they thought of it they would of wrote it so does that mean every single brain is unique or perhaps vsauce can answer the probability of our brains being identical like the mathematical probability of us being the only life in the universe maybe it is possible but the human population is just to small of ratio
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats true reddit is a much bigger population to sample than
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the answer is no your own question wasnt a yes or no question it wasnt even a question but i am glad you are telling me the answer is no and that you have collected evidence on
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and its full of reposts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no on nothing that says the same exact thing can be said twice and so a exact phrase can be uttered only one and my thought was helping me put my thought on that board
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes but my thought was when i was putting it on not on reddit and no one thought of doing it on yet so i was the very first but does that man people in the future will have this thought and then it doesnt count l
Showerthoughts,not_removed,since im the only the one who have thought this question on the answer is no no one has ever thought it before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no its not but i was the first person to post it on thats the thought
Showerthoughts,not_removed,said tiny winner lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you have my up vote sir
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you mr catseatuwhenudie
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its scary enough as it is not going near the ocean ever
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it scares the crap out of me when you cant see what your swimming over im not sure if seeing what is down below would be worse or not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well the majority of the ocean is clear like that swimming pools can see the bottom because of the blue color they paint the floor if it was painted black it would look like the ocean light can only travel a certain distance through the water
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes it would
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when httpsyoutubeiprpnqduso in the ocean i would be scared too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i havent seen jesus in like two thousand years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can watch the olympics every two years
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there was a scandal ridden shit show of an olympics just years ago
Showerthoughts,not_removed,of those whove burnt to death
Showerthoughts,not_removed,downvote cuz begging for upvotes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im unsure whether to downvote because begging for votes or upvote to prove this post wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,upvote for honesty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but wait youre proving my point so i am correct send apologies at earliest convenience thanks
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aww yesss the old catch
Showerthoughts,not_removed,upvote for upvote for honesty
Showerthoughts,not_removed,upvote for upvote for upvote am i doing this right
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shit dood downvote cuz u messed it up smh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,story of my life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive seen dogs with their balls dragging on the ground its weird to not look at that point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,apparently it was a good one
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hell yeah it was i was on the edge of my seat the entire quarter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i call that my tuesday nights
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mountain folk do this with whiskey
Showerthoughts,not_removed,similar to every pizza is a personal pizza if you try hard and believe in yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at times i feel like im trying to get fat last time i was eating a pint of ice cream and i finished it cause i am american alright i took off the lid and threw it away cause im not a quitter everyone jim gaffigan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sometimes i throw out the lid on accident so i eat it all rather than taking the lid out of the trash or its my subconscious challenging me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or keeping the lid and throwing out the ice cream its all perspective
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or when you open a bottle of wine and throw out the cork
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is your real name jim gaffigan
Showerthoughts,not_removed,commitment is cutting the container in half and using it as a bowl
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the bigger the lid the greater the commitment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,kill bill song booms in the foreground
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well if you are fat like me that is easy lol
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and all this time i thought i was afraid of commitment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but before throwing out harvesting all that ice cream on the lid with a spoon setting it on the counter for a moment and then saying fuck it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,came here to say this was too slow presumably because of all the ice cream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i prefer mondays myself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,can i come to your house tomorrow then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lid throwing out on a tuesday got frogurt in the pint its so fruitay
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sunday funday for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,try hard pffff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,who doesnt finish a bottle of wine come on have some spirit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or you know you could just use the container since its already pretty much exactly a bowl edit grammar
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre not fat youre just in calorie debt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sounds more like a sunday sundae to me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats way better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never heard of a woman trying to stop someone drinking the bottle just stealing the booze and drinking it themselves of course most of the ladies i know could outdrink an entire frat on pledge week
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well which am i having wine or spirits
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i normally buy round containers for using a spoon they get a bit deep unlike this thread
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lol yes debt that i am trying to pay off now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sundae funday
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why not both with a tub of ice cream
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you implying that you are actually a robot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,aroobot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i say it in a robot voice in my head
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i immediately said both of them like richard nixon after reading this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre onto me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,helium
Showerthoughts,not_removed,gift from the doctor
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe op is an alien
Showerthoughts,not_removed,was this thought done during a shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and here i was thinking i should get into the shower to think of something original
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rshitterthoughts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i mostly forget my shower thoughts and theyre often repetitive like but really whats more gross showering in the morning or at nighteverydamntime
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i must justify my thought so no
Showerthoughts,not_removed,catch and release always seemed cruel to me ripping the lip or throat flesh out of a fish and tossing it back in you dont feel sympathy bc it doesnt express pain shoot a deer in the ass you better go finish the job asshole or go back to the range relative equivalency would be choosing to not take the shot but you are out there and could have but the beauty of nature trumps your game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,a hole in a fishs cheek will heal and the animal does not feel much pain a good solid shot on a deer will kill it even if the hunter was a veterinarian kinda hard to release that back into the wild
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i doubt most assassins would bother performing surgery on their intended targets dont quit your day job
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres prolly some schooling involved that one or the other didnt have too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,is damaging earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is fucking true its the butter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im with you all the way on the grilled cheese but two slices of bread two mozzarella and some frenchs yellow mustard has never let me down
Showerthoughts,not_removed,believe it or not if you use mayonnaise instead of butter youll get a perfectly browned grilled cheese and a heart attack thats a twofer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,couldnt agree with you any more so yummmm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes perfect sense egg yolks and oil delicious you just cant beat the flavor of a rich fucking butter
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why doesnt amazon realize if i bought a jug of laundry detergent im probably going to need another one soon but if i bought a bicycle thats the last thing i need
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if it is consumable then replenishing it would make sense
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i bought a wedding ring online a few months ago they wont stop trying to sell me wedding rings now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you can use this to your advantage a bit by putting things in your cart then leaving them there for a week or going through he checkout but canceling at the last confirmation often you will then get adds targeting that product or similar with discounts or coupons
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they usually advertise a better model for less so you hate yourself at least in my experience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure it has something to do with reinforcing your decision
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same with netflix why are you showing me movies ive already seen and why are you showing the same movies in consecutive categories
Showerthoughts,not_removed,none its a myth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not if its ultraviolet or infrared
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also not if its in space the beam needs to be bouncing off of something eg particles in the air for it to be visible and
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and not if were talking about microburst lasers also keep in mind that real lasers actually move at the speed of light as in from here to the moon in just over a second not at the walking pace you see in most scifi movies and games
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is why you can see barely controlled rage fill teachers eyes when someone says the classic youre a teacher you get so much time off
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i agree my ex was a teacher she used to ask me to assist in marking i didnt agree with some of her marks and gave up helping she would think close enough is good enough i thought by doing that she wasnt doing the student any favours better to say theyre wrong and show them where they went wrong some of her students were supremely stupid though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it was originally invented as social criticism against capitalism
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes even little dogs can become wealthy landlords
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget the risk of going to jail for nothing other than a random reason
Showerthoughts,not_removed,also your friends and family members are actually giant assholes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i guess it kinda worked everyone fucking hates monopoly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,til monopolys purpose isnt to rip families apart
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nobody ever plays by the rules anyway there are tons of house rules that drag the game on endlessly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre drunk get out of the shower before you slip and hurt yourself
Showerthoughts,not_removed,whaaa
Showerthoughts,not_removed,something like red has little to do with bed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that statement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats an infected vajayjay and thats a statement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im trying to find words that rhyme with vagina
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a statement but its not that statement
Showerthoughts,not_removed,china
Showerthoughts,not_removed,calvin klein kindanorth carolina
Showerthoughts,not_removed,makes sense your teeth are part of you skeletal system whats your point
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no very false teeth lack collagen which is the substance that gives bone flexibility and allows them to heal after being broken aside from blood supply teeth are mainly a calcium deposit with blood supply in the enamel and capability to heal on their own sorry edit you can down vote me to the bottom but it doesnt make you any less wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what if we downvote you slightly above the bottom will that make us slightly less wrong
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it would likely cause the end of the world best we dont mess with fate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or cherry flavor tastes nothing like cherry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpimgurcomoxqirtp ive seen this before
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres the story that the heart symbol comes from the shape of a seed from a now extinct plant that the romans used as a contraceptive so the symbol would appear on shops selling contraceptives i dont know if its true but its a great story
Showerthoughts,not_removed,be the one to create it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its in room
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive never understood how people actually enjoy driving between work traffic fuel costs and a mediocre car whats there to like i wake up earlier and take the bus to work just so im not the one getting frustrated behind the wheel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im afraid ill never get to enjoy driverless cars because im too used to driving when im sitting behind the wheel
Showerthoughts,not_removed,easy fix have kids with marry jane get a divorce and then get joint custody
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but dont be too blunt about it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well yeah this is kind of what happens for people with synesthesia their brains see music in colors amongst other responses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,isnt synthesia feeling the pain of others
Showerthoughts,not_removed,such as
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the individual atoms that make up the world
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or fragments of meteorites that could be older than the earth
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i was thinking along the lines of meteorites
Showerthoughts,not_removed,like the one posted recently in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how high are you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we do know what dogs hear and what not
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we can measure what frequencies animals can hear
Showerthoughts,not_removed,most females are able to hear the dog whistle pitch i cannot
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i blew a normal human whistle and my dog was startled and started circling me they can hear them
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i havent looked down im afraid of heights
Showerthoughts,not_removed,unless youre dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or you always had weight and when you didnt have weight you didnt exist
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,when an infant shits raisins they look more like grapes than when they went in
Showerthoughts,not_removed,which is why its one of the best dad jokes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rtinderstories
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im pretty sure it hasnt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how did they say of course not back in the old days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i dont know what ops smoking
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because it still costs money to produce
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why would people make food if it was free
Showerthoughts,not_removed,economics if we have the ability to print too much money why isnt it just free if we have the ability to make too many cars why not just make them free its a quite senseless argument
Showerthoughts,not_removed,he wasnt the first astronaut he was just the first man on the moon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,winners are grinners
Showerthoughts,not_removed,neil
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sadness probably
Showerthoughts,not_removed,soap
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yes because soap dries my skin and shampoo and body wash are more gentle
Showerthoughts,not_removed,maybe both too much shampoo and its be oily too much body wash itd be dry side question since im thinking of it can bald people get dandruff
Showerthoughts,not_removed,their own tears is an acceptable answer
Showerthoughts,not_removed,as is known bald mens tears are abrasive and cleansing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is known
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if reddit stopped awarding karma points i wonder how many people would stop reposting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ugly people like me would post more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people would just start commenting the word like instead source my lack of faith in humanity
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i remember there being plenty of selfies on myspace despite there not being any likes then again that could be why fb is a multibillion dollar company while myspace is only mentioned as a punchline
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its called snapchat and people still do it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its mostly for attention of any kind not just likes if they kept comments then people would get their attention that way
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then maybe my old high school friends would stop periodically begging for attention by posting theyre going to u friend anyone who hasnt liked a post in a while
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive seen tons of selfies on snapchat and there is not like system on there so probably it wouldnt change much
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if reddit stopped awarding karma points i wonder how many people would stop reposting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,more just look at snapchat stories
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i feel bad for kids that grow up in a world of social media where their self worth is based on likes and not who they really are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i wonder that if people stopped fistbumping with each other everyone would stay home and reddit facebook and instagram instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just ask facebook they test stuff like this all the time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some people would continue consider the social media vsco there is no liking or comment system and yet many people continue to use it regularly
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seriously i feel like people just love the attention and the need for everyone to know what they are doing at all times
Showerthoughts,not_removed,so like snapchat
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this guy wants do kill facebook even more than he is now
Showerthoughts,not_removed,there are plenty of people who have a low number of followers and still post doesnt change a thang
Showerthoughts,not_removed,facebook or as they call it attentionwhorecom
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i would not post anything on instagram
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if facebook counted the total number of likes like reddit karma there would be even more attention seeking posts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,true
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if im honest id post more
Showerthoughts,not_removed,roughly the same amount probably profile pictures still have to be updated once in a while
Showerthoughts,not_removed,me i do it anyways
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this would actually make a very good social experiment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,facebook already did that by giving preference to paid content and filtering everything else youve probably noticed the same posts over and over in your feed edit not sure why this is being down voted facebook officially acknowledges this change they put a pleasant spin on it but they are by no means denying any of this
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you beat me to it mr master i will concede and delete my similar comment you deserve the karma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not many this sub was full of reposts even before text posts gave karma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,le
Showerthoughts,not_removed,touché
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its a valid point i couldnt care less about my karma however i feel there is distinction between hosting other peoples content for imaginary points and hosting pictures of me for points the former wants imaginary points regardless the latter wants validation for the points theyve accrued
Showerthoughts,not_removed,hahaha same here buddy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,my lack of faith in humanity has determined most people would be too lazy for that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no remember myspace days before the likes and retweetsreposts people would just leave behind comments either showing love or fake love in the end people would still upload selfies to get some form of approval from others whether it be a simple like or a comment on said post
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what does people liking posts on insta relate to your lack of faith in humanity god why is reddit so against people having social lifes
Showerthoughts,not_removed,upvote
Showerthoughts,not_removed,
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but you still get to see who sees your picture so that might be good enough for some
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah but thats to make me mates laugh init
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not likes but views which could be even more powerful as what if your crush or s celebrity viewed it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,beat me to it eh
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i asked them but they didnt get back
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive noticed that fb is absolutely garbage nowadays my newsfeed only shows content from the same people who i barely know or care about and the rest are ads
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mr tiny weiner you are a small and humble man i hope you dont go unappreciated
Showerthoughts,not_removed,brilliant comment really added an extra dynamic to that first comment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,laugh emoticon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tom will always be in my top 💖
Showerthoughts,not_removed,then upvote his comment and leave we dont care
Showerthoughts,not_removed,it is ive noticed girls will track certain mans too
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats the wonderful new algorithm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tiny winner but thank you for noticing the wordplay mr genital diddler
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sick meta addition really adds to the whole theme of reddit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you know while posting it i thought about you and what youd think i thought what will learn from what im typing i spent a lot of time on that comment in hopes itd please you im glad i did a good job thank you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this mans right herr is taking all ur womenz
Showerthoughts,not_removed,though i would love to see posts from my close circles i would also like to see random posts from other friends maybe theyre going golfing or something and you guys can catch up or something
Showerthoughts,not_removed,okay mr tiny weiner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well you really did help me out i just couldnt understand what dalitmasterrace was trying to say your approach to the subject really shed new light for me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shut the fuck up you puffed up ignorant twatbag you shag toasters in your spare time ya cunt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,angery
Showerthoughts,not_removed,please have the courtesy to call me by my correct name mr clam pounder
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tiny wiener genital diddler and clam pounder sound like names from an erotic nursery rhyme food for thought edit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,tiny winner
Showerthoughts,not_removed,sorry edited my comment
Showerthoughts,not_removed,perfect much better
Showerthoughts,not_removed,mr tiny weiner is just commenting for karma
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or for hunting
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in which case you give them away to get something else trade then
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats a lot of belts
Showerthoughts,not_removed,cant be letting shit like this slip through the cracks any longer man now you gotta use your shampoo again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you made me imagine that i was quickly blowing air out my nose
Showerthoughts,not_removed,swing and a miss
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think an apple a day keeps the doctor away is a pretty proapple statement that would be silly propaganda for microsoft a leading competitor in personal computers
Showerthoughts,not_removed,putting the name of your competitor into peoples heads seems like a bad idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if you buy apple you cant afford treatment how do you like apple now that you spent so much on it those were what i was going for
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i am pretty much looping through the martian interstellar prometheus and the new star trek trilogy every few months space it is a tempting mistress
Showerthoughts,not_removed,for me it is books not movies i cant reread books because it is predictable only harry potter has wanted a reread for mr
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont forget apollo and from the earth to the moon
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rhfy dont know if youve heard of it but i love space and scifi and if you can handle reading you will lose yourself in this sub
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thanks will check it out
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well some people at least p
Showerthoughts,not_removed,too bad that has never happened once
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dont get the analogy but probably cause i have prime
Showerthoughts,not_removed,not without consequences my friend
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and then you become fat and everyone fat shames you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or would it sound more like alvin the chipmunks whispering seven days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,the speed would not matter at all just glancing at it is enough to get you the last days of your life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,why wait it already is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i saw the dubbed version of friends once but it wasnt just dubbed they also removed the laughtracks from it man it was painful to watch so many awkward silences after mediocre punchlines
Showerthoughts,not_removed,if a joke is funny i dont need a queue to laughi just laugh i managed to get my hands on m a s h without the subtitles and that definitely increased the quality of that show if i recall correctly the producers didnt want the laugh track but the studio or network insisted on having it i think its different when theres an actual studio audience present during the taping like some bits on seinfeld are almost funnier due to the audiences reaction
Showerthoughts,not_removed,just to be clear i meant to give the viewer the option not to just remove them altogether
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but then you wouldnt know when something funny happened
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this would filter out the mediocre comedy writers from the exceptional peerless gut busters i thoroughly enjoy new girl for its original comedy albeit odd and ott
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but then the show would be filled with awkward pauses
Showerthoughts,not_removed,some of the scenes completely change chandler goes from witty to abusive monika goes from cute to mentally ill phoebe becomes a monster same is true with big bang theory watch it without a laugh track and its downright depressing
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i never know when to laugh unless the studio audience gives me the cue then i know its socially appropriate
Showerthoughts,not_removed,british comedy does this a lot it makes it even funnier imo
Showerthoughts,not_removed,both of those shows are shot in front of a studio audience
Showerthoughts,not_removed,idk i mean you have a point and def the right to question its authenticity but those camera men are some mother fuckers bro what a ridiculous job some of those guys have
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i know exactly the scene youre talking about either the bird mother fucked up or the crew staged it and theyre really fucked up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they lay the eggs up on the cliff so that their little geese babies dont get eaten by predators the birds jump when theyre still really small and fluffy so they dont splat against the ground which as you saw the majority of them made it i too was surprised by that evolutionary tactic but if all your ancestors did it your body is probably fairly suited for it also beats getting eaten by an arctic fox while youre chilling in your nest
Showerthoughts,not_removed,haha true dont mean to discredit their patient resiliance
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the correct answer and far too logical
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ive heard that not making your bed is good because the fresh airsunlightmagic kills bacteria in your blankets and sheets
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because itll look nice for the unexpected company that never seems to go in my room let alone come by at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i never do if someone comes over and is disturbed by my lack of bed making then that is a person who will not be invited over again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i have the same thoughts about showering why shower when im just going to get dirty again
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i muted ours months ago no one has said anything i dont know if anyone has even noticed
Showerthoughts,not_removed,but i like hearing the beginning of the imperial march when my food is ready
Showerthoughts,not_removed,seems like an intentional design flaw if you ask me
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think microwaves should be able to sync with our phone which will vibrate when the popcorn is done added bonus you could use the microwave to help locate your lost phone
Showerthoughts,not_removed,microwaves are
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i also hate when microwaves have shit touch buttons that you have to press really hard or else they dont work
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpssuicidepreventionlifelineorg you go op just in case your next thought is about toasters in the shower
Showerthoughts,not_removed,or when they keep beeping at the end of the countdown even after you open the door gah
Showerthoughts,not_removed,never seen a truer word on reddit my oven doesnt beep and i do perfectly fine
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its for blind people
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you live alone unepherblue dont be overly dramatic
Showerthoughts,not_removed,how
Showerthoughts,not_removed,people could be on night shiftflexible scheduling or hungry
Showerthoughts,not_removed,exactly it should be an option not mandatory it already stops cooking when the time runs out its not like shit is going to burn unlike your oven
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to wake them up
Showerthoughts,not_removed,wellthe voices havent mentioned it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theres a sound button on mine now it doesnt beep
Showerthoughts,not_removed,to let them be sure button is clicked havent you seen that everything that can be accessed by disabled peoples beeps like atms traffic lights dect phone keys etc if manufacturers will not do that thay can be sued for ignoring disabled people that thing that beep can not be disabled that is what is really annoying and wtf
Showerthoughts,not_removed,um it was a bit of humour connected directly to op sorry to have upset you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we all will isnt that pleasant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,what i find worse is how many of your friends and family are going to die before you the unavoidable truth that my dad will die and i will have to do the arrangements brings me to tears even thinking about it my own death on the other handmeh my believe in the end of thoughts and existing with death lets me pretty much not care at all
Showerthoughts,not_removed,no it is very sad ill miss you denalicain
Showerthoughts,not_removed,think about it this way do you prefer to handle the arrangements after your dad dies always completely heartbreaking but expected or do you prefer your dad to handle the arrangements after you die honestly the idea that there is always a possibility that i die before my parents do making them lose their only son is by far worse than considering the very sad but natural order of things that the parents will go first maybe if you think like this it wont make you so sad because either you die at the same time extremely unlikely and terrible because both of you would die before your time in this situation either he dies first or either you die first and he has to handle the pain of losing a son
Showerthoughts,not_removed,ill miss you too mrjellydonut
Showerthoughts,not_removed,youre right i dont want my dad to bury me helps a little my grandfather had to bury two of his three children his wife died on his birthday and his mother in a work accident doing what he was supposed to do but couldnt because he was sick i dont want anyone to suffer through so much loss and guilt but as always the solution just dont think about it as you said natural order
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you fuckers forgot about me im hurt
Showerthoughts,not_removed,theoty live long and prosper and when you leave this mortal coil i will mourn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,fucking awesomejust imagine the guy that spilled butter on it for the first time
Showerthoughts,not_removed,still waiting for someone to comment on whomever lmao
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im still on the fence with that i couldnt decide if whoever or whomever was right assuming we dont know who discovered popcorn isnt that the proper context and a person would say whoever if they dont know who theyre talking about but assuming another does i dont fucking know im high
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and now im reading
Showerthoughts,not_removed,understandable your skin will repair itself your shirt is now ruined
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i understand you didnt pay for your skin but that shirt probably cost a bit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im sure youd feel the same if you had a gaping hole in your face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i think the dissapointment you feel in a hole in your shirt compared to your skin is inversely proportional to the size of the hole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because shirts dont heal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,your skin heals for free a shirt doesnt man there are ways of making basic bodily functions sound so badass
Showerthoughts,not_removed,discovered holes in shirt today can confirm
Showerthoughts,not_removed,skin doesnt cost money fabric does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shit i tear holes in my body for fashion
Showerthoughts,not_removed,shirts dont heal
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everytime my skin tears i throw it away and buy some new skin
Showerthoughts,not_removed,depends on the size of the hole
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you beat me to it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i came here just to comment that haha
Showerthoughts,not_removed,grandma will magically fix it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i think its about time someone made a selfhealing shirt bucks says there will be a kickstarter for it within a few months
Showerthoughts,not_removed,same
Showerthoughts,not_removed,well i think its about time someone made a selfhealing shirt bucks says there will be a kickstarter for it within a few months
Showerthoughts,not_removed,we have holes in our face
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and theyll take the money and run
Showerthoughts,not_removed,any hole is a goal s
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and then pores
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in years youll be dead and seem like a strange idea
Showerthoughts,not_removed,they will have data centers instead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,in years we will be so very glad that we had hard copies of what we did and wish we had had hard copies of everything
Showerthoughts,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikitheobsoleteman
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is the best thing to come out of this sub today
Showerthoughts,not_removed,this is brilliant
Showerthoughts,not_removed,easily offended people often start sentences with im not easily offended but
Showerthoughts,not_removed,do u get triggerd bro
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i cant believe you just said that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,are you offended by that
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im offended you had to ask
Showerthoughts,not_removed,soyou are offended
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im offended that i have to tell you i am offended
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im offended thatyou have to tell me youre offended
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you guys are making me nervous i need a safe space and i need it now there will be a protest at noon tomorrow
Showerthoughts,not_removed,im offended that the reason you are offended is because you asked if i was offended which offended you
Showerthoughts,not_removed,because you cant travel to office and back home in a plane and the traffic is worst so we wish for flying cars but again how it will solve the traffic problem well may its my own shower thought d
Showerthoughts,not_removed,light aircraft is ok
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its so you can unlock the door and open it with the right hand
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you may find your off side is stronger while your dominant side has better fine motor control well thats how it seems my body is
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you beat me to it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,thats how it is for everyone usually anyway
Showerthoughts,not_removed,you beat me to it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i beat myself to it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i just lost the game
Showerthoughts,not_removed,nice decent way to put it
Showerthoughts,not_removed,oh but he does
Showerthoughts,not_removed,at this point who cares
Showerthoughts,not_removed,one time i was watching sex tv and i saw one man buttfuck another man that was probably the gayest thing ive ever seen
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its not gay were just being men
Showerthoughts,not_removed,and here i thought it was all that gay porn
Showerthoughts,not_removed,dudes strutting with half chubs also a guy flashing his huge bush at everyone scarred for life
Showerthoughts,not_removed,see you on the field
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yup sounds like every highschool locker room
Showerthoughts,not_removed,those were the days
Showerthoughts,not_removed,i dont know but who the hell am i that gov should concern im nobody
Showerthoughts,not_removed,that makes you public enemy
Showerthoughts,not_removed,its more in regards to current news as though you need a room to be wiretapped your phones a wiretap dipshit
Showerthoughts,not_removed,lel id watched enough movies and theories
Showerthoughts,not_removed,itd probably be higher because eventually living people would run out of resources and resolve to stealing from the dead
Showerthoughts,not_removed,damn what about first stop
Showerthoughts,not_removed,yeah i honestly have no clue why this is still greenlit makes no sense to me but then again i know like of the logistics behind the olympics
Showerthoughts,not_removed,everyone thought it but brazil is the most populated country so they deserved a shot at hosting probably some greased pockets that made it actually happen though
Showerthoughts,not_removed,rios economy was actually predicted to grow massively by the time of the olympics that didnt pan out and here we are today
