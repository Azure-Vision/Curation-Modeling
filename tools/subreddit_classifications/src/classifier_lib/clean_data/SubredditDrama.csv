SubredditDrama,removed,i guess the guy bought into the fear mongering that white nationalists have been promoting for decades he did not work it out himself he was spoon fed it and rewarded for being a good student now he thinks it is true and because whenever someone beliefs are challenged they feel their identity is challenged he will fight like a caged rat and even has reading comprehension problems because of the trapped rat mentality sad

SubredditDrama,removed,also if that weapon ends up being used to kill another person who isnt white or cuban jewish whatever the hell zimmerman is i will not be surprised in the slightest lots of minorities are killed by other minorities in gun violence the number one killer of black men is other black men so yes if another minority dies at the hands of another minority it will not only not be a surprise its a statistical likelihood im not sure why you have to bring up white when zimmerman is a hispanic peruvian origin man who killed a black year old its the unfortunate reality when when have so many minorities in poverty this is a class and a proximity problem not a race problem so why are you talking about white people when they have nothing to do with this sources in most homicides involving one victim and one offender were intraracial about of black homicide victims and of white victims in single victim and single offender homicides were murdered by someone of their race httpwwwbjsgovcontentpubpdfbvvcpdf

SubredditDrama,removed,im glad you conducted a survey to be able to say with authority that most people agree with you i can tell that your concern over the perception of the word degenerate was important enough to you that you did the background research before this thread necessary to make claims over what most people think about the word rather than just pulling out random assertions on a subject you didnt even know was a thing before this thread youre not offended you dont personally know anyone who is or at least no ones felt the need to share that with you before this point thats lovely obviously there are a number of people who feel different and what the fuck does it matter to you if theyre discussing it in their own sub
SubredditDrama,removed,i stand in awe of your disdainful aura of pure cool allowing you to look down smugly on the fools that care about things which you obviously totally dont at all because caring would mean youre right and thats just as much a selfevident truth as your ability to make populationwide statistical generalizations on a subject you knew nothing about before today without doing any actual research on the subject
SubredditDrama,removed,whoa whoa if you cared any less you might just stop responding with attempts to show just how much you dont care still props for going against the grain because i just ran my own nonsurvey just like you did and discovered most people do care so yeah fight the system you apathetic hero you
SubredditDrama,removed,because dying by assault rifle is sooooo much worse than dying by another violent method gotcha you know your arguement for instantly dying versus dying by arson or other violent criminal method almost seems to endorse the use of so called assault rifles in the interests of humane actions you are a bernie voter arent you
SubredditDrama,removed,those shitlords aimirite😠
SubredditDrama,removed,dying violently by one method is far worse than dying by another violent method because the common wisdom of the current year says so you should add some key phrases and buzzwords to your pathetic screed for effect
SubredditDrama,removed,is that why gun control is usually led by slimbag sellout traitorous jew politicians glad to know that your standards are based on the needs of less than point zero two five percent of the planet fuck those hooknosed shysters if you want them come and get them

SubredditDrama,removed,nigerian pleaseblood libel my assyour entire history is about being persecuted every jew holiday is about that time you almost got holocausted or that other time you were expelled or removed from an area and heres a newsflash for you far more groups of people find the jew to be an utterly repellant and filthy creature other than palestinians and germans internet hasbara always fucks up thinking that world history started in no people have hated the jews for much longer than that and it is not your much vaunted yet fanciful blood libel you people are parasites plain and simple

SubredditDrama,removed,lol so mexico isnt a shitty country its ran by the fuckin cartel and has a lot of violence
SubredditDrama,removed,semantics you can ban books on a criminal level or you can just ban books from curriculums the effect is the same and the people deciding over it have a legal mandate to do so from the state furthermore texas affects the whole country you are just trying to sidestep the whole issue with semantics
SubredditDrama,removed,why are you ignoring the actual issue
SubredditDrama,removed,if i dont teach calculus it doesnt mean im banning it thats the problem americans teaching creationism instead of calculus to chidren even in public schools

SubredditDrama,removed,rpolitics reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
SubredditDrama,removed,emotionalturboplep yeah that about says it all i cited facts and was downvoted by you left leaning freaks i never said i was just asking why i told you why want to talk about lazy arguments why is it that the left always talks about suicides that happen even when people dont have guns but never talk about defensive gun usage
SubredditDrama,removed,no are you really this stupid i cite japanese suicides methods with reference and you reply no citing cdc studies in the us perhaps you should actually learn to fucking read before you reply let me repeat it so you get it the japanese suicide rate is much higher than the american rate and they cant get guns so they hang themselves and jump from buildings rather effectively too if people cant get guns they are still going to suicide youre too dumb for this conversation and youve just proven it oh wait redditor for months with karma so obviously you must know everything about everythingor you just post like you do while you collect unemployment
SubredditDrama,removed,this is not how srd works

SubredditDrama,removed,nothing pisses off nerds like a character that deviates from straight white cis and male unless its a woman whos created solely for jerking off purposes
SubredditDrama,removed,so what do you mean lgbt does this mean tracer is a lesbian or is she a dude thats transitioned but still likes the ladies if its the former why cant we just say shes revealed to be the l in lgbtq i dont care enough to read the comic
SubredditDrama,removed,it would make my if bliz announced that tracer was actually lgbt i can just imagine the massive shitfit the usual gamer crowd would kick up over it after so many of them became weirdly emotionally invested in her butt this year
SubredditDrama,removed,being lgbt isnt really a big deal these days negative points yeah this is very true plus points classic reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,of course the first openly lesbian character in overwatch would be one thats specifically designed for the male gaze sigh
SubredditDrama,removed,whats kia or tia
SubredditDrama,removed,hi there id love to hear a follow up response to this refuted argument presented by this
SubredditDrama,removed,she fears a cartoon frog those are the most important things that guided my decision wew lad
SubredditDrama,removed,actually we didnt hide it at all during the election and proudly wore the label he was banned for trying to make raltright into rthecuckold
SubredditDrama,removed,sounds like theyre doing awesome work toward making reddit great again
SubredditDrama,removed,wow did you really miss the point the obvious double standard is that jews want israel to be only for the jewish race israel is an ethnostate but this hypocritical rabbi has the audacity to criticize richard spencer the most famous white nationalist in america who is advocating for an ethnostate for whites
SubredditDrama,removed,lol youre either an idiot or deliberately avoiding the point im making it doesnt matter whos fault it is i agree the bigots are more to blame the point is when the usually young people on the left act overly zealous all they do is push people in the middle over to the other side shouting at racists might make you feel warm and fuzzy inside but its a selfish action when youre pushing people away from out ideology
SubredditDrama,removed,i agree i believe muslim arab men should marry jewish women for peace and harmony in the middle east there are lots of terrific leftwing groups in israel supporting openbordersforisrael
SubredditDrama,removed,youre the kind of person that sjws try and tell me is just a strawman made up by the alt right because nobody is that stupid in real life im saving your comment for the next time they say that
SubredditDrama,removed,rthedonald isnt racist enough for the raltright but its getting closer where we are for example rthedonald openly hates muslims and mexicans however they have opened their hatred toward blacks now after the chicago blmkidnapping where we really want to get them to is hating the ethnic cousins of muslims
SubredditDrama,removed,exactly glad you agree there are white male trump supporters who will look at you with a straight face and say theyre not racist but they support building a giant wall on the border banning muslims and sending the military against black lives matter every so often theyll post a photo of a self hating minority wearing a trump hat to cover their asses many of them will come out publicly as altright in to months as trump cracks down on brown people believe me
SubredditDrama,removed,were a clever bunch
SubredditDrama,removed,thats a common misconception about the altright let me correct the record david dukes stormfront is far too tame for us we actually hang out at the more extreme the daily stormer that promotes holocaust jokes and is run by neonazi white supremacist andrew anglin its disappointing to me how many users on reddit downplay our extreme beliefs and attitudes
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off and die
SubredditDrama,removed,its not about misconceptions tbh its about pure hate they hate jews and they use misconceptions to justify their bullshit even if you proved them wrong in every way theyd still hate you and then find a new way to justify their hate dont get me wrong i think people can change but its not that easy
SubredditDrama,removed,whats satire
SubredditDrama,removed,it also happened a long time ago know what else happened a long time ago hillary cunton laughing at rape victims and constantly lying about everything

SubredditDrama,removed,bunch of paedos
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a fat idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know about him but i can tell you why i voted trump even though as a californian it didnt matter much most of it came from a dislike what happened under hillary clintons time as secretary of state drone strikes to start with are pretty bad my local mosque has a bunch of right off the boat or first generation american yemenis a year or two ago the mosque worked hard to gather donations to send to peoples familys in yemen civilians who were getting bombed via drones under clinton i read articles talking about how we employed a doubletap strategy with drone strikes which i think is banned under the geneva conventions but then hillary became the second coming of christ but with boobs when she ran for president perhaps drone strikes will continue to happen but i like to think that the dnc is going to be less corrupt with politicians that are berniecrats and in four years well have a better president also he talks like that because he goes on
SubredditDrama,removed,a quick check through his post history reveals that even other alt righters think this dude is an asshole

SubredditDrama,removed,askgaybros is a really awful subreddit that thread is only the tip of the iceberg
SubredditDrama,removed,that subreddit is a piece of work take a group of mentally unstable selfloathing insecure gay men with intractable social anxiety depression poor selfesteem poor coping skills sexual frustration and dissatisfaction subtract from that any iota of common sense or a basic foundation of reality that any average human being would normally possess add to that raskgaybros obsession with straight men and the concept of being straight and factor in the negligence of the moderator towards his own subreddit the lack of any respectable moderation and regular trolling and you have a recipe for disaster askgaybros is inarguably a disaster as you can see i really dislike askgaybros i truly do feel bad for those people my friend quooklyn has had similar experiences as me

SubredditDrama,removed,this is completely false hillary clinton is confirmed to be involved in a number of criminal conspiracies trump is not it is that simple if you really want to go nuts about it you can start at the uranium one scandal and trace the whole criminal enterprise from there the smoking radioactive gun uranium one tldr uranium one is the name of a south african company that bought kazakh mining interests through bribery and the political influence of the clintons later bought by frank giustras canadian company who then sold the company to russia the podestas got paid the media wont cover the severity of the crimes the new york times did a great article about the uranium one scandal that america seems to have forgotten but is very relevant as it outlines the actual relationship between hillary clinton and russia as opposed to what we are being told in the news today cash flowed to clinton foundation as russians pressed for control of uranium company httpsarchiveisvrmkk there are a few reasons this story is especially important the panama papers and the podesta emails both provide independent primary source direct evidence that this story is true and worse than originally stated you can see it for yourself treason is happening at the top levels of our government where our politicians and lobbyists are willing to sell out american assets for pennies on the dollar and surprising number of them are all in on it the media is representing all of this as no big deal while shamelessly trying to sell a war between russia and the us over fake news about hacking it lends credibility to the idea that these people in this social circle are capable of running a vast sophisticated criminal enterprise that talks in code we are able to trace the web of money launderers all in bed together through primary sources starting with these breadcrumbs this is a screencap from the offshore leaks offshoreleaksicijorg that shows ras corporate services and troika dialog are connected the observer does a good job of breaking down some of the relationships to make them easy to understand panama papers reveal clintons kremlin connection among the sberbank subsidiaries that the podesta group also represents are the cayman islandsbased troika dialog group limited the cyprusbased sbgb cyprus limited and the luxembourgbased sb international in podesta email it is revealed that bribes were happening through a variety of mediums first with respect to the stock option agreement there is a discrepancy in the stated vesting schedule between the one john signed back in and the one i sent to bob which you sent back to me signed john transferred the resulting common shares from the option exercise to the leonidio llc as such we would need to edit the transfer of share agreement to reflect the transfer of common shares to the llc notice the dates this scam has been in the works for years media matters was already trying to spin damage control on it in ny times failed to note giustra reportedly involved in kazakhstan mining deals more than a decade ago uranium one posted million in revenue last quarter the podesta group fails to disclose this financial arrangement to congress which is technically treason here is the congressional report azerbaijan hong kong trade development council republic of india republic of iraq embassy of japan republic of kenya republic of korea republic of maldives republic of the union of myanmar republic of south sudan center for study and media affairs at saudi royal court socialist republic of vietnam these entities get a louder voice in us government than us citizens it is clear that a violation of the voorhees act is occurring httpsarchiveisvjvq not only is this technically illegal it is obviously unethical and it should boggle every americans mind that these people are allowed anywhere near public office yet they are in the white house and have been for a long long time the media has gone out of its way to make sure you dont see it for what it really is organized crime us code § registration of certain organizations the following organizations shall be required to register with the attorney general every organization subject to foreign control which engages in political activity in fact the kazakhstan government felt exactly the way americans should feel mukhtar dzhakishev who worked with clinton to pass off the mining interests to russia was charged under articles of the criminal code of the republic of kazakhstan article section large scale fraud committed by an organised group article section misappropriation of entrusted property on a large scale committed by an organised group article section accepting a bribe in a large amount article misappropriation of entrusted property article abuse of power why arent americans outraged because their attention is being diverted to conflicts manufactured by the media everyone has forgotten about convicted felon bob creamer and massive election fraud proven by okeefes hidden cameras everyone has forgotten about paid agent provocateurs pretending to be violent trump supporters austyn crites got off scott free even though he was clearly an agent provocateur committing voter fraud and who owns a creepy daycare property httpsslimgtzqorbjpg the prison blood scandal httpsislimgxgutkyjpg whitewater scandal httpsarchiveistkkgl hillarys fingerprints on vince fosters documents bill clintons controversial pardons even the washington post has trouble explaining away a publication funded by saudi arabia and its ties to huma abedin httpsarchiveisredno keep in mind the washington post is owned by the cia hillarys brother ends up on the board of a gold mining company in haiti aftermath hassan nemazee httpsarchiveiseczfg this is all just the tip of the iceberg it is important to note the pattern of scandals how many there are and how widespread they are that is why when it becomes apparent that this social circle is also riddled with pedophiles httpsslimgddfwzsjpg people start to wonder about pizzagate and if the clintons are connected to any of the pedophile rings out of chicago dallas franklin and washington dc jt packing john and tony has virtually the same board of directors as the clinton foundation and has been operating out of an empty lot since the clinton foundation seems to be the epicenter of the new organized crime that has successfully infiltrated our government the us has become a mafia state run by criminals where law enforcement and the media are focused on eliminating competition the media is involved wikileaks made it clear how much collusion was occurring between hillary and the media hillary was astroturfing the internet httpsarchiveiscovjl we no longer have to wonder what the new version of operation mockingbird looks like jidf correct the record tavistock institute of human relations they explicitly instruct the media to represent issues a certain way then have their internet astroturfers give illegitimate exposure to bogus ideas it is a system of mass persuasion that is a lot more sophisticated than people are willing to give it credit for it is easier to fool people than to convince them theyve been fooled mark twain it is possible that every conflict you are presented on the news is controlled on both sides in order to follow a script and keep you distracted from the criminals who are negatively impacting your lives and your childrens lives because they are traitors if pizzagate was totally fake then there would be no need to spend the amount of time and money being wielded against fake news the likes of which may have never been seen pizzagate has drawn the attention of all kinds of paid internet shills all day everyday they are trying to derail the narrative that reveals the wider web of slime and corruption even the us government has people who are specifically on the internet trying to steer all of this conversation away from the president himself who has been to comet ping pong who is central to the fiskergoreobama scandal and who was seemingly born in kenya if you check every news article before he ran for president it is all organized crime the clinton foundation is the epicenter of political corruption and the media is trying very hard to keep you from recognizing that basic provable fact if we are to believe the washington post and the new york times treason and other crimes have occurred on a massive scale why is it so hard to believe that human trafficking would be any different the truth is that this all starts and ends with mining the nexus of illegal gold mining and human trafficking report httpswwwveriteorgthenexusofillegalgoldminingandhumantraffickingreport frank giustra is involved in mining companies marc rich who was pardoned by clinton was also involved in mining with glencore hillarys brother ended up on the board of vcs mining human trafficking is inevitable around mining companies whoever is managing these companies is also managing the networks that provide them with the slaves they need
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahahha idiot thats a fake news myth can we actually discuss his cowardice now
SubredditDrama,removed,liberals do not deserve human rights donald trump supporters everybody we won faggot donald trump supporters everybody got em
SubredditDrama,removed,then they came for the kikes
SubredditDrama,removed,you mean
SubredditDrama,removed,that aint how sexual fantasys work you must be new to sex
SubredditDrama,removed,good to know the socialism mods realize furshit and weebshit belong in the trash
SubredditDrama,removed,oh i know i just like to remind them that theyre stupid cant even comment on the drama itself but instead why wasnt the drama about this fucking lol social justice college kids
SubredditDrama,removed,hurrr
SubredditDrama,removed,we dont have a crack team of analysts working around the clock here we have social justice kids idly poking around instead of doing their homework
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah the whole thing stinks
SubredditDrama,removed,its the theory that the political spectrum isnt a line so much as a horeshoeshape putting the two extremes farright and farleft closer to each other than they are to the middle
SubredditDrama,removed,those relationships really helped her win huh
SubredditDrama,removed,you either dont understand why pedophilia is wrong or you are playing dumb because youre a pedo so which is idiot or pedo
SubredditDrama,removed,right up until the point when he said that those are all the same reasons he has endorsed hillary clinton for president they all went insane and started screaming at the old man but he kept on can i get a source for this or a name of the black senator
SubredditDrama,removed,muh million dead jews
SubredditDrama,removed,horseshoe theory is weird commies want to play nice but its impossible when half the world is undermining you
SubredditDrama,removed,erm do you really think thats all theyre saying heres a really good glimpse into the mind of a jewish academic and the stuffs endless heres a recent story about their antiracism work as for being hateful i mean the current antiwhite status quo is way more hateful than anything i espouse do you not read the news professors tweeting about wanting white genocide mtv giving new years resolutions for white men oscarssowhite white this white that i want a place where we can live in peace without being abused daily and im the hateful one thats a real mindfuck
SubredditDrama,removed,dae all whites have it amazing and they cant ever complain because theyre all super rich and live in mansions and oppress poc daily they shouldnt complain when theyre trashed every day in tv and movies they shouldnt care when their culture is erased they should embrace it seriously fuck you and fuck everyone who thinks like you the goys are back i ntown
SubredditDrama,removed,are you stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,yup trump pounded away on how hed bring the jobs back to blue collar rust belt voters whove been swinging for forty years to whoever promised to bring the jobs back clinton never responded
SubredditDrama,removed,wow lots of morons here too sad
SubredditDrama,removed,hey why wont you respond to my numerous messages inquiring about me being banned in rprogressive
SubredditDrama,removed,ahahaha i just came here to post this im a mod of rmorbidquestions this has been a good night pass the popcorn
SubredditDrama,removed,ive seen a photo of this user its a something white girl
SubredditDrama,removed,what if that suburban housewife was an admitted serial animal abuser
SubredditDrama,removed,its more than one incident
SubredditDrama,removed,yusss those evil white devils not wanting diversity destroying their country theyre horrible
SubredditDrama,removed,muh million dead jews
SubredditDrama,removed,what is my main point my point was this isnt simply people harassing some poor girl on the internet theres some shit this bitch said first to bring it on herself im not saying anyone should to anything to her but this is to be expected if youre going to go on the internet and claim you have a history of abusing animals
SubredditDrama,removed,which was evidently a mistake judging by the results of nov
SubredditDrama,removed,the family dog what else and before you say cat murder killing an animal isnt abuse really how is killing an animal not abuse
SubredditDrama,removed,im starting to think this is a long troll and the girl in the picture is just someone you and the op dont really like irl thats a decent theory i was not told not to share this photo or given it in any confidence i didnt even ask her for it im just sending it out because people want to see what i saw i reverse searched it and couldnt find any matches i dont think theres much harm if it is what it probably is fake but if it is real and this girl is so dumb she just sent me a picture of herself to prove shes not a man its hilarious im in it for the lulz
SubredditDrama,removed,why did you send me a pic of that woman when it may not even be her ive never had any interaction with you before so its kind of strange you were making fun of her looks on the other thread and its pretty awful because the username could be photoshopped and yoru first reaction is to post screenshot of him sending it with the link clearly visible youre so smart
SubredditDrama,removed,all a lot of us long term liberal democrats have to say to them now is that we warned them they choose not to listen told ya so you supposed long term liberal democrats said that hillary is battle tested and electable and can beat trump we told you that it would be mistake to vote for hillary to be democratic nominee as evident by the results of nov in which hillary failed to beat trump it was true we warned you you chose not to listen told ya so
SubredditDrama,removed,instead i got removed as a mod and shes still there
SubredditDrama,removed,so because you arent familiar with it you get to act smug on rsubdrama its an ancient method of carrying a knife pocket clips or belt clips arent available on the vast majority of fixed knives even today having something hang down your neck with a lot more uncomplicated especially since these knives are tiny
SubredditDrama,removed,special props to uridleyscotch for his work on tracing the trolls you can be a great seeker
SubredditDrama,removed,til that people are afraid of inch pocket knives what a world of pussies i would have totally mocked that uptight baby boomer bitch behind the register
SubredditDrama,removed,hello rsubredditdrama heres some wayback machine links to post history edit hello rsubredditdrama heres some wayback machine links to post history
SubredditDrama,removed,hello rsubredditdrama heres some wayback machine links to post history
SubredditDrama,removed,hello rsubredditdrama heres some wayback machine links to post history
SubredditDrama,removed,hello rsubredditdrama heres some wayback machine links to post history
SubredditDrama,removed,hello rsubredditdrama heres some wayback machine links to post history
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe thats why trump won because you people just dont understand
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think voting for her means approving of her at least speaking from personal experience i thought she was better than trump i certainly didnt despise her frankly i found her a tough pill to swallow point is voting for someone isnt the same thing as approving of someone for some of us it just means that given our choices shes the best one available
SubredditDrama,removed,i have the clap
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah guys leave those pedo rings alone they just want to rape kids in peace
SubredditDrama,removed,youre an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,what happened to reddits its not their fault they were born that way defense of pedos does it not apply here
SubredditDrama,removed,morons like you are why this shit is happening in the first place you cannot ignore the fact that high level pedo rings exist
SubredditDrama,removed,bruh youre an idiot suffering from textbook satanic panic
SubredditDrama,removed,what makes it so hard for liberals to tell the difference between nazis and a fucking regular ass populist movement
SubredditDrama,removed,suddenly reddit cares about pedophilia
SubredditDrama,removed,then youre an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,wasnt the point at all ffs youre retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,they call uspez a pedophile cuck and sulk when they get punished fucking idiots
SubredditDrama,removed,well photos of children with many comments that are full of pedolingo that are linked to high officials need some kind of explanation or is that a really crazy thing to ask
SubredditDrama,removed,here is the best and most articulately expressed post on why pizzagate should be allowed to be investigated there is simply too much coincidences to be nothing at all
SubredditDrama,removed,i heard they also release day dlc for kids
SubredditDrama,removed,that comment seems very informed but actually misses alot of information and photos that could use a little explanation to put it very mildly
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah no it was not like that
SubredditDrama,removed,read more about
SubredditDrama,removed,but the admins still httpsnpredditcomrpedofriends active gotta love the priorities
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahaha planetfreewillcom what a shill
SubredditDrama,removed,ok i get the general idea of pizzagate but ive yet to see a post outlining all of the reasons or facts of the theory yet im open to hearing it and am genuinely curious
SubredditDrama,removed,but the admins still allow httpsnpredditcomrpedofriends to remain active gotta love the logic there whether or not you agree with the conspiracy people should still be questioning why the fuck the pizza places owner while also hosting several events for hrc and at tony podestas home the connections and i emphasize are nothing more than connections are eerie and deserve some investigation by professionals not reddit also worth mentioning
SubredditDrama,removed,just wrote a longer response just above but i assume youre talking about the unclothes teenagers washpo article here it is httpsarchivefovddro i looked up katy grannons work and of course there are no nude teenagers on google because that would be illegal so i have no idea what art was on the wall only what was alluded to in the article
SubredditDrama,removed,link to redpill me on pizzagate
SubredditDrama,removed,i genuinely cant believe youre defending that photo you are a despicable human being if you dont find that disgusting with or without context if this pizza place was familyfriendly that photo would not raise suspicions but that place is very adultthemed i want to hear your twists on these photos from unnamed pizza place these are just some of the weird and eerie things going around the dc pizza place admins i am not jumping to conclusions i am simply providing irrefutable evidence of the creepiness that no media outlet has brought to anyones attention
SubredditDrama,removed,but blaming russia for hillaries loss is still ok
SubredditDrama,removed,hope renoughtrumpspam is next
SubredditDrama,removed,looks like the shills are in full force watch for their circle jerking berniebrotrumptard comments and report them
SubredditDrama,removed,im not sure what we expected thanks to rthedonald the front page of reddit is going to be the new pol
SubredditDrama,removed,the significance of obama playing ping pong is that it is posted on the twitter feed of the guy who runs comet ping pong ie obama is personally associated with a very dodgy person running a very dodgy business pizzagate isnt about omg weve found a connection between obama and that pizza guy pizzagate is about the dozens of connections between people in power people who are convicted suspected paedophiles and artists who create paedophileinspired art as well as the very suggestive private emails that the podestas send to each other about children
SubredditDrama,removed,httpsdcpizzagatewordpresscom
SubredditDrama,removed,sup
SubredditDrama,removed,james alefantis and david brock correct the record boss were lovers keep being condescending as fuck though guys especially when the topic is about the most heinous crime there is it doesnt turn people off of your shit no sir
SubredditDrama,removed,taking pity on pedos this isnt salon dumbfuck
SubredditDrama,removed,itt nothing to see here cp isnt real youre all conspiratards
SubredditDrama,removed,worst case scenario you witchhunt innocent people ruin their lives and drive them to suicide you absolute pea brain
SubredditDrama,removed,that doesnt even mention the dudes instagram
SubredditDrama,removed,of the shit trump said about hillary was bullshit
SubredditDrama,removed,i bet you didbnt even take the time to look at the evidence not all of it was noteworthy but there were a few very concerning things that need to be looked into deeper
SubredditDrama,removed,i was seriously enraged by the whole rpizzagate thing normally i dont want to participate in internet drama but this has got me pretty riled up not because its an insane conspiracy theory with so many holes what made be emotional was that there was an active witchhunt happening and it was so blatant places of businesses private social media accounts websites youtube videos they were getting brigaded by people reddit etc it was boston bombings investigations and that innocent daycare getting harassed incident all over again and nobody seem to learn anything from those events oh wait while people did bring them up there were also highly upvoted comments in reply saying that reddits investigation on the boston bombings was true but the authorities planted a successful media campaign to discredit it to prevent future citizen investigation lunatics i admit i unhealthily followed the sub for a while as it was genuinely interesting to see what sort of mental gymnastics the top minds could come up with i eventually stopped for my own sanity as i was getting irrationally angry and there other other irl things to do but i really wanted to from an antpizzagate sub or write a long detailed post debunking all of their theories ah heck im doing it now got to get it out of my system tldr above was just me making an emotional rant about rpizzagates witchhunt below is me trying to debunk some of their theories that made the rounds its a good introduction to those out of the loop the first part deals with how it all begain wikileaks leaked out several emails linked to the podestas clintons or their affiliates and some of these emails mentions pizza this links to a restaurant in washington dc called comet ping pong owned by james alefantis from what i read it is an offbeat hipster kind of place which has ping pong tables for customers to play with large murals with artwork that some may find strange a backroom which often hosts live concerts and weird restrooms which were hidden behind wooden false walls which were hard to access the podestas apparently love this restaurant and tony podesta celebrates his birthday there clinton held fundraisers there and is chums with the owner james alefantis this is more than enough to link alefantis with the podestaclinton inner circle of evil the second part of the infographic are photos from james alefantis instagram which was made private when the conspiracy blew up it features several photos of children some offcolour jokes and comments about sexual humour and pizza and things like that without context this is very creepy to some long story short this is part of the proof that alefantis is a pervert and the photos of children are very suspect could he be pimping them out on instagram the lower half part of the instagram is a big clue of the conspiracy theory the symbol used by pedophiles this is the part which enrages me the most nearby comet ping pong there is a takeout pizza place called besta pizza if you look at heir logo it is a triangular spiral this is obviously a pedophile symbol and the shop is a front for pedophile shenanigans not only that the shop is owned by a ex high ranking official in the department of justice sorry i cant remember who a politician with close ties to the clintons and whos work involves lawmaking and investigating of childtrafficking and child abuse crimes or something like that as soon as the conspiracy blew up the shop website quickly changed their logo and made a quick statement explaining the change we legit didnt know it was a pedo logo this was seen as an admission of guilt according to rpizzagate and that a connection between other businesses and the clinton pedo ring exists thus begins the witchhunt on other companies to see if theres any evidence of their involvement in the clinton cabal such evidence is mostly finding dan brownesque type of symbols logos and choice advertising text used in the companys websites i manage to find an example of this in action one person looked into the ip address andor the server that besta pizza uses and found links to a whole other bunch of restaurants in dc because god forbid that fb establishments go to the same it companies to handle their website needs he discovered that is highly suspicious as its logo is a spiral at this point they are looking for any normal spiral and not the specific triangular blue spiral the chef knows james alefantis and the company website use text like an intimate dining experience as a code to advertise child slavery he went on to look on to other pizza places and made many screenshots of damning evidence such as this yes the cartoonist nedroid the one behind the i made this repost comic is now implicated in all this other evidence in other restaurants include pizzerias which has a baby in their logo or photos of children in the childrens section of the menu suggestive text etc i could go on and on about the crazy shit these lunatics were posting as evidence but i already invested too much time and energy into this i should stop for now but i must talk about one more thing one of the key photos that the conspiratards uphold as a clear evidence was the instagram photo of a girl whos hands were taped with masking tape onto the table this was found to be very creepy as it has connotations such as child abuse and bondage and is one of the biggest piece of evidence that was used to accuse james alefantis of wrongdoing yes i concede that the photo can be unsettling without proper context but have you not seen kids do innocent things that may be misconstrued by adults as something malicious or sexual one time when i was a kid during art class there was masking tape the same kind in the photo on the table used for arts and crafts purposes we played with it and decided to see if masking tape was strong enough to hold our hands against the table we taped each other hands with a lot of the sticky tape just like what was shown in the instagram picture if anyone is wondering even massive piles of masking tape isnt enough to hold a year old male kids hand onto the table we could still free our hands from the tape without much force and anyway eventually the identity of the same girl that was on multiple photos on jame alefantis instagram was revealed she is safe and sound and i think shes a daughter of a close friend or relative to alefantis reddit and went to post her photo all over the internet anyway
SubredditDrama,removed,so youre for the pedos how sad made a note for your username pedo sympathizer
SubredditDrama,removed,its not fear its disgust elite paedophile networks have been exposed in almost every western country why do you think they dont exist in the usa too dennis hastert is a childhood friend of the podestas who got exposed as a paedophile clement freud exposed as a paedophile friend of the podestas the list goes on and on and on
SubredditDrama,removed,pizzagate is crazy town and subreddit drama is just srslite both shitholes
SubredditDrama,removed,good choice go to reddit alternatives without censorship so these bribed reddit admin boiysz get few thousands dollars less if they deleted this it means we were onto something

SubredditDrama,removed,i havent seen such a nasty farcical obviously false conspiracy theory since sinead oconnor announced hers in a systematic industry wide conspiracy where numerous hierarchies toptobottom in the catholic church involving covering up and shuffling hundreds of thousands of pedophiles and sexual molestors guised as priests for decades possibly longer spanning the entire globe im glad america destroyed her
SubredditDrama,removed,its not blatantly false dumb fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,wow the real headline here is admins do something for once
SubredditDrama,removed,there is soo much more evidence this is nothing but no matter how much evidence i give you it cannot be proven without the proper authority of the fbi but it sure as hell looks suspicious i am not one of the people that was deep into this investigation but this is a piece of the evidence that stuck out to me the person who posted that photo on instagram owns a pizza place called comet ping pong look at the logo of the comet ping before the pizzagate scandal and after now look at this unclassified fbi document that shows common symbols of pedophile rings httpswikileaksorgwikifbipedophilesymbols
SubredditDrama,removed,yes its all just a bunch of circumstantial shady and creepy stuff but the fact that it is so very extensive is what makes people suspicious the kicker for me was laura silsby why was clinton so interested in this lady who was eventually busted for stealing children why set her up with an attorney who was a convicted sex trafficker etc so many disturbing and unanswered disturbing that it is impossible for most people to dismiss it reminds me of the rumours about gw bushs homosexuality it was only of interest because he received enormous support from rabid homophobes all the evidence was circumstantial old stories road trip with gay buddy gay prostitute given a press pass and coming and going from the white house at ainstance pictures of them embracing any one instance is easily dismissed but after so many instances over a long period of time there has to be something there and everything else aside there is one thing that is hard to explain how does the president become intimately acquainted with a nobody who is a gay escort similarly everything else aside how does hillary know laura silsby what possible connection could they have it bears looking into
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,sounds about right
SubredditDrama,removed,no she has said and bill has said she literally speaks to the dead you dumb fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,oh honey i dont give a fuck about your opinion i thought my comment had made that cyrstal clear this wasnt an invitation to engage you can please go have a seat now
SubredditDrama,removed,no but this paedo circle needs investigation by the authorities without interference from those in power who are associated with circle members
SubredditDrama,removed,are you a pedophile
SubredditDrama,removed,wow get help before its too late
SubredditDrama,removed,and now srd swoops in to make themselves feel superior so im an independent observer in all this didnt register to vote so i dont care whos president although it brought a smile to my face to know that hillary didnt win after her godawful campaign where she basically just expected to be handed the job because shes smarter than trump and hoped everyone would forget that she tells everyone what they want to hear and then does her own thing based on who she owes favors but i digress this subreddit is probably more toxic than rpizzagate i didnt read the sub but i was aware of it i read a lot of the theories especially when it was still contained in rthedonald i didnt take it seriously hear that morally superior arrogant douchebags i didnt think any of it was a smoking gun or possible to correlate i thought it was all weird thats all its out of the ordinary it doesnt make a whole lot of sense for grown men to talk about food in the way they do some of the weird connections to haiti are weird thats all i think about it in a nuthsell its strange if you dont think its strange then you havent bothered to read the emails again does any of it correlate absolutely not and thats where rpizzagate lost me but i think this sub as just as much of an echo chamber if not more noxious because youre all united around feeling morally and intellectually superior to other people none of you are that smart get over yourselves
SubredditDrama,removed,it really needs to be noted that uspez and other admins were implicated in their investigation and thats probably got something to do with the ban
SubredditDrama,removed,the overt pedos moved to darknet boards not you moron
SubredditDrama,removed,have you seen the logos for the the other establishments in that block besta pizzas also owned by alefantis has the symbol for bit lover as their logo a day after that came to light they changed it it is still on their menu though another store has another symbol for girl lover as their logo look into it that is a very small part of the evidence we have found i highly suggest looking into this theory thousands of normal people who have never believed in conspiracy theories have been racking their brain trying to disbelieve what we have seen if we are right then children right now are being tortured its worth just taking a look

SubredditDrama,removed,no one wants to hear that autistic shit we dont need another racist cesspool they can hang out in thedonald or
SubredditDrama,removed,kids are in serious danger and your worried about the personal information of the people doing these things your in the wrong side of history go research it in voat
SubredditDrama,removed,sexism isnt real lmao
SubredditDrama,removed,o shit not the firealarms call the national guard i have literally never heard any arguments about how apparently feminists go around shutting down discussion of male gender issues read the misogynist rallies of mras who have little to say aside from blaming women and feminism that dont refer to the great firealarm pulling which you have no clue whether it even involved feminists meanwhile you go literally anywhere on the internet aside from small pockets and feminists have to deal with constant death and rape threats asinine strawman arguments and misleading debunking and public freakout videos used to undermine any criticisms of systemic toxic misogyny its not even close and the idea that were even having this argument when a nearmajority of voters including women voted for and endorsed the embodiment of rape culture and systemic misogyny for president is laughable
SubredditDrama,removed,the admins have shown they themselves will bend over to take the satanic dick of the monied elite time to destroy reddit all their cucked staff and migrate elsewhere
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,sounds about right for someone from austin
SubredditDrama,removed,bot beep beep im all about top posts this post had upvotes and got posted to twitter and subreddit the tweet all upvotes are on and and most importantly all posts on and
SubredditDrama,removed,people have a right to privacy and having their personal lives respected except for muslims so that we can accuse them of being notrue scotsmen whenever a terrorist attack happen how is that grandstanding
SubredditDrama,removed,so you have no income and pay no taxs hahahahahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,from your first article according to attorney ruth eldar of the noga center of the ono academic college men will take advantage of the legislation to defend themselves against rape charges by accusing the women of raping them false rape accusations used to be a big concern for mras but suddenly it conveniently isnt
SubredditDrama,removed,here is something that was posted just before the pizzagate sub was closed i have been a pedoring conspiracy person for a while yea yea i am crazy i know look into some of the conections yourself a lot is just coincedence but much of it is head scratching the investigation is merrited the internet is hard to control
SubredditDrama,removed,it is not remotely objectifying all the good fics have very interesting characters reimagined over and over again in different fics regardless of gender
SubredditDrama,removed,shush
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah i was coincidentally rewatching his specials on netflix and while he does seemingly go on tirades against pc culture or whatnot what separates bill burr from guys like the op is selfawareness of how terribly unhealthy it is to be feel threatened by women and faglike behavior
SubredditDrama,removed,what a bloody cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,vegans are pussies move on already
SubredditDrama,removed,tbf if realizes how much online racism is directed and venus and serena its pretty hypocritical to ignore how badly infested with donald youth his site is at this point the pus isnt just oozing from the sore its turned into sepsis
SubredditDrama,removed,so many redditors adore strong black women so im sure this will be nothing but wellwishing for months and months
SubredditDrama,removed,also this is coming from redditors so just never mind really redditors never fail to amaze me at the petty shit they choose to die on a hill for then again its a decent snapshot of the general public minus the old people so its safe to assume about of them are idiots
SubredditDrama,removed,clown 🤡
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit is an organization aimed at instilling fascist values into children
SubredditDrama,removed,are you a neo nazi autist instant coffee might as well as drink motor oil amirite
SubredditDrama,removed,if you are right then why was your terrible shitpost removed yea td is filled with racists everyone knows that but your comment was dumb af and irrelevant to the drama lol
SubredditDrama,removed,can we please stop using child molestation and pedophilia as synonyms you can be a pedophile your whole life without ever doing anything wrong or illegal doing this just further stigmatizes the problem and makes less people open up about it and seek help
SubredditDrama,removed,i think it is unreasonable to expect perfect mock meats at this time by that i mean that meat is not as good as you think it is food that does not exactly resemble meat is not worse for that reason
SubredditDrama,removed,gross fucking degenerate
SubredditDrama,removed,the standard on which food is judged should not be how close it comes to being meatlike because meat isnt that great
SubredditDrama,removed,fags are overrepresented among pedos ever wonder why these people all have fucked up fag brains thats why its the same degenerate shit like incest zoophilia and all that
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think the labeling of a product has anything to do with how it tastes i am wanting to ask why are the unique properties of meat the thing that you want
SubredditDrama,removed,people think a lot of things
SubredditDrama,removed,points at chair thats a chair
SubredditDrama,removed,we cant exactly exit the realm of opinion when were discussing taste
SubredditDrama,removed,nice meme
SubredditDrama,removed,i completely disagree with this and i can find numerous scholarly articles backing me up by simply googling brands image marketing and public perception are all proven to impact ones opinion of quality of a product food or otherwise im have no doubt that this is true but this is an obtuse interpretation of my point can you rephrase no this tiring when i eat a banana i do not think wow if only this tasted like a burnt slab of beef i am applying this exact idea to mock meats or any other food that is not meat a food not being meat or meatlike does not make it bad
SubredditDrama,removed,imo the o means opinion people are fools if they think their food needs to have the exact properties of meat to be taste good and imo the o means opinion those properties can make the food worse
SubredditDrama,removed,meats obviously the gold standard so thats what we want thats an opinion
SubredditDrama,removed,you can argue about opinions over how well it substitutes meat i can argue about how well it needs to replicate meat to taste good i am arguing that it doesnt that is my entire argument you are fine to disagree but im done with this dumb as fuck exchange
SubredditDrama,removed,yep agreed
SubredditDrama,removed,and how well they substitute their original they dont need to imo thats it
SubredditDrama,removed,and that meat doesnt even taste good to begin with it does not necessarily taste good so no something being meat does not make good taste i didnt mean that meat cant be good or doesnt generally taste good to people if its not doing its job whats the point of it its food that you can eat and enjoy i dont think people should want or need it to be exactly like meat this is all i wanted to say but probably havent expressed it well
SubredditDrama,removed,the scientific literature is pretty clear on this im not against global veganism but its not going to happen until we can grow meat in a lab christ dude i dont want to argue with your stupid as fuck memes
SubredditDrama,removed,im glad we agree
SubredditDrama,removed,you shouldnt want or need it to this
SubredditDrama,removed,funnily enough this twerp posts his own tinder disasters
SubredditDrama,removed,come on this has to be a troll their name is uhymenlebman
SubredditDrama,removed,cutfags are so cute rationalizing their state
SubredditDrama,removed,what fags
SubredditDrama,removed,well they kind of are
SubredditDrama,removed,i honestly think some straight white guys like to pretend theyre gaybi on the internet as if it magically absolves them of all provilege and lets them speak for the lgbtqiiaaf communoty
SubredditDrama,removed,does it make you uncomfortable to see marginalised groups getting acknowledged or something
SubredditDrama,removed,ok individuals of oppressed groups often need reminded that there are people who are there to help and support them sometimes its better to accept that instead of calling them ridiculous
SubredditDrama,removed,im sorry that you think so i thought this sub was more accepting than the rest of reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,i wasnt looking for an argument i just feel like a lot of people replying have the same vibe as the i just dont like gay culture folk that the original commenter pointed out
SubredditDrama,removed,is this your attempt at role playing
SubredditDrama,removed,go to bed and stop trying to understand us politics
SubredditDrama,removed,first youve just proven that you have no idea what youre talking about the link you provided is talking about playstation now not playstation plus now provides cloud access to games and isnt neccessary to play online it costs a month playstation plus provides a handful of ps vita and games a month and is neccessary to play online oh no i dont know enough about a particular gaming consoles hidden fees whatever will i do without that useless information youre the one saying a month for a bunch of games you own is more expensive than some free demorental crap it doesnt even compare second youre the one that brought up grey market key sites since you dont seem to understand what a grey market is ill pull up a definition oh wow so youre reaching for ad hominem attacks now thats intelligent it was literally words in my whole post and you latched onto it and went on about one particular site that i said i didnt use lol i know what it means i only bought one game from one site yes there are more than one and a shark card from instantgaming finally lets look at your build to start that build doesnt include an operating system so unless youre going to run the wide array of games available on linux this has already flunked the test but hey a windows key is only about on ebay that only puts you above the sale price of a oh shit you sure pwned my build i already have a copy of windows mice and two keyboards why would my build need what i already have and costs nothing and how is that over the price of a exactly are you still insisting games cost maybe for you not on pc they dont lol edging the price of your build up to still below so youre still not wrong ok this build falls below required minimums doom requires at minimum an hd radeon youre bringing a it requires an cpu youre bringing a itll hit the ram requirement but most aaa games are asking for its already below specs and were dealing with games from the past give it a few more years its unlikely this thing will comfortably run most new releases much less at actual hd and you have no idea what youre talking about the game runs perfectly on that card and processor ive tested it myself so obviously it isnt required at all thats a upgrade anyway and apparently youve never even heard of overclocking double lol i could go on and on the hard drive youve listed is refurbished which feels like a bit of a cop out compared to a new drive but thats debatable your controller is also wired a third party build which will be of considerably lower quality youd need a mouse to finish the windows install process spoiler alert i used equipment and sources that i myself built computers from its from micro enter ive never had an issue but if i did i could just walk in and return it so even if this is more powerful than a on paper the issue is that pc games arent often optimized at the low end of hardware whereas on a console theres a security that the machine you own will handle what comes out until a set point of obsolescence what you said you could go on and on and this is what you come up with i have security that this build is solid off paper because im using it right now your console is locked down by the manufacturer so it can things play apps only they sell music and watch tv your argument is chalk full of the same myths and excuses youre as bad as pcmr
SubredditDrama,removed,lol fucking vegans

SubredditDrama,removed,it reminds me of that story that periodically surfaces around reddit about buzz aldrin punching a conspiracy theorist i dont know if i should be surprised that there seems to be more hand wringing over punching a literal nazi than someone who thinks the moon landing didnt happen
SubredditDrama,removed,oh look a rsocialjusticeinaction poster defending naziism so which type are you a true believing fascist or just one of their useful idiots who think youre le rational hero sticking it to the sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,nazismfascism has violence ethnic cleansing baked in so it isnt terrorism its believing that the nazis mean what they say and responding proportionally to the situation there are those that think we can tolerate intolerance that society can survive this particular cancer given the stillinlivingmemory bodycount and the number of times countries havent survived i believe that a do not fuck with the culture response is more appropriate

SubredditDrama,removed,this guy unfortunately is not a troll in one of his posts he claims to use the fake name bruce wayne to be able to comment and follow her videos after some stalking of myself i found one of his commentsfrom nearly months ago whats worse is that he asks if she has a boyfriend i hope this kid gets help video that he comments on

SubredditDrama,removed,uphunnelcake youre fucking up man
SubredditDrama,removed,upvote this post let it be the first result
SubredditDrama,removed,popular will is not always the best criterium yet you cant completely disregard lest you become authoritatinand kia isnt fighting agaisnt left or right its about liberty vs authoritanism kia is about liberty really i thought it was about whining about anything that kia labels sjw kia always gave me a wierd mra vibe im not cool with that kia is like the boys locker room room in high school reeking of adolescent testosterone and male insecurity no thanks
SubredditDrama,removed,follow through this logic here you got banned people get banned for being an asshole from and we surmise that you were enough of an asshole to get banned the racist didnt get banned from and we surmise that the racist was not enough of an asshole to get banned from and we conclude that you were more of a dick than the racist
SubredditDrama,removed,this im not taking a side is a rhetorical tool ive seen being used since the red pill becoming a force on the site its sock puppets trying to appeal to people on the fence
SubredditDrama,removed,science is the sole dominion of islam given that it would not exist as we know it without algebra algabr which was invented by a muslim we should really recognize the privilege we have in being able to learn from such a rich civilization and its members instead of demonizing them by closing our borders thereby missing the opportunity of building something as glorious and prosperous as the old grenada
SubredditDrama,removed,whoa i had usuperpuro blocked so i saw none of his comments and i thought this guy was him anyways that other guys is banned i guarantee you
SubredditDrama,removed,learn to not talk in memes you fucking child is your mom tucking you into bed now
SubredditDrama,removed,i thought it was your bed time
SubredditDrama,removed,elfa youre a fag for thinking this is a troll drakus is a year old baby who thinks hes cool though his entire life is a dank meme
SubredditDrama,removed,you know i could tell your gender from the sheer amount of passiveaggressive sarcasm
SubredditDrama,removed,trumpets and the regressive left letting fascists get into power out of respect for freeze peach is more regressive than just marching them to the wall while you still have a chance
SubredditDrama,removed,who gives a shit theyre all a bunch of daal eaters anyway
SubredditDrama,removed,dogs are better than cats i hope you die
SubredditDrama,removed,dogs mcfuckin kkkill urself
SubredditDrama,removed,as beautiful as this here rope
SubredditDrama,removed,give me a valid argument with facts and logic why you little shits downvote me hes gone full reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,the violence was at she brought it to and he brought the to youre just a sexist twat
SubredditDrama,removed,people are forgetting the basic facts its only ok to hit women if youre a movie star
SubredditDrama,removed,nice try
SubredditDrama,removed,sexist is fine just dont call names gotcha
SubredditDrama,removed,in a moral society there is no such thing as had it coming when it comes to violence you can live out your fantasy of hitting a woman all you want society isnt going to tolerate you if you pull that shit irl
SubredditDrama,removed,touching is assault did you start asking loaded questions before or after the lobotomy
SubredditDrama,removed,updated so you can rest easier tonight have a good day
SubredditDrama,removed,ah so youre in the who are insecure about their masculinity
SubredditDrama,removed,good thing they have trpers like you who are so eager to teach them
SubredditDrama,removed,the guy literally said his reasons were islamic though this wasnt reported until recently
SubredditDrama,removed,oh true probably both reasons then
SubredditDrama,removed,they take oaths which arent biblical you mean like a person takes when they go to court or become president or enter the military or take the hypocratic oath etc do you just not like oaths that arent biblical or something
SubredditDrama,removed,you cant even join the masons unless youre religious
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah its hard to have a proper investigation when the people involved are corrupt as hell
SubredditDrama,removed,act like an adult please says the zealot who is sticking to their childhood brainwashingindoctrination
SubredditDrama,removed,i know is nominally for womens perspective but from what i recall its been overrun by butwuttabout the menz types
SubredditDrama,removed,i doubt it she already gave the rich white person half assed apology and need for self reflection speech shell probably just get a fine
SubredditDrama,removed,are you retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,ill be honest here at this point the only reason i pay any attention to lindsay lohan is that im still hoping shell get desperate enough to do porn before she stops being pretty not an ageist thing mind you plenty of older ladies are hot as hell nor a slight against sex work nothing wrong with doing porn in my book im just saying that addiction takes a toll and porn stardom is obviously a slightly lower rung on the celebrity totem pole than mainstream movie acting i really thought it would happen after she did the canyons with james deen even if not straight up porn at least a brown bunny style real sex on camera moment
SubredditDrama,removed,but since im a reddit user and a cs student im smaaaarrrrrttttt yeah theres really nothing of value about this website to begin with so to be honest there should be nothing posted anywhere because the building that holds the servers has been burnt down and a landfill has been put in its place
SubredditDrama,removed,they should have ate bullets
SubredditDrama,removed,nice meme
SubredditDrama,removed,the average trump supporter has a political memory of approximately seconds give or take seconds
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont believe i violated any rules with that comment but if a mod weighs in and says it does too far ill gladly delete it i made it ridiculous enough that the sarcasm should be obvious but you never know
SubredditDrama,removed,what a shithead i hated clinton but voted for her over him theres no question who was better for gay people
SubredditDrama,removed,ill never get people who think its immoral to fuck animals because they cant consent but have no issue having them killed and cooked so they can be eaten
SubredditDrama,removed,such edge much ratheism very troll
SubredditDrama,removed,why would you cite a document that supposedly supports your argument when you dont know what it actually says welcome to reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,git your liberal facts outta here
SubredditDrama,removed,amazing im a muslim and i believe in american ideals no you dont youre all evil pedos who hate freedom and you should take responsibility for what your people do which means were allowed to treat you like shit there are a lot of racist trump supporters you cant lump us all in one group fuck you this is why he got elected because youre all bigots who hate white men reeeeeeee
SubredditDrama,removed,nun uh im registered for the affordable care act dummy
SubredditDrama,removed,theyre like living caricatures thats why the muslim has a higher upvote count than the idiots arguing with him right
SubredditDrama,removed,the sooner you pedos are deported the sooner we can work on making america great and not end up like the eurocucks tell me again how rthedonald isnt bigoted
SubredditDrama,removed,the post was advocating that the us begin slaughtering muslims because hurr durr they do it in iraq id take that pretty personal too if i was a muslim joke or not
SubredditDrama,removed,if youre a member of a shitty organization then yes you should reconsider if youre a good person this isnt rocket science said by a trump supporter
SubredditDrama,removed,i think they get pissed in general if you call them anything that theyre not sure what means you could probably call one an orthodontist and theyd murder you for it
SubredditDrama,removed,islam is a religion but it is also a judicial and governmental system the first should be left alone the second and third have to be stomped into the ground before it has a chance to spread
SubredditDrama,removed,td must be the easiest group to trigger
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah im really hurt by that statement maybe i should go to the hospital and get my feelings checked for free
SubredditDrama,removed,hopefully hes seen what his fellow trumpers are like and might change his perspective also he believes in an invisible man in the sky so hes pretty confused anyway
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly he deserves it its not as if that sum or trumps bigotry isnt blatant if he wants to be a house nigga than he should expect to be treated like a house nigga
SubredditDrama,removed,because she is worried obama will enact martial law and refuses to leave the white house
SubredditDrama,removed,i know sky daddy is gonna be pissed
SubredditDrama,removed,can we just call it a hate sub and ban it now
SubredditDrama,removed,im amazed that muslim trump supporters even exist thats basically treason to fellow american muslims then again caitlyn jenner supports a political party that opposes her very existence as a trans woman
SubredditDrama,removed,honesty youre probably better off now
SubredditDrama,removed,not safe for cucksinteresting
SubredditDrama,removed,the whole thing seems fake almost like someone set this up to try and make td look bad and post the results in their shitty sub but who would do that 😎
SubredditDrama,removed,im all honestly i despise all religions not just islam islam isnt special religion poisons the mind into thinking youre not good enough without your imaginary friend it makes you feel unworthy it makes you feel bad that you have certain feelings it ostracises you from people and people from you cant people have their own moral code without not reading through an archaic text written by a bunch of people in the desert a few thousand years ago
SubredditDrama,removed,what an uncle toum sadly i know several muslim americans who voted for trump theyre doctors and engineers and small business owners more concerned about potential tax cuts than anything else pulling up the ladder behind them
SubredditDrama,removed,islam is shit whats the problem
SubredditDrama,removed,islam is a religionideology not a race
SubredditDrama,removed,oddly that subreddit hasnt been quarantined even though subreddit quarantine was made specifically for racist and bigoted subreddits its almost like the admins are playing favorites
SubredditDrama,removed,muslims constitute of the american population yet have committed over half of all terrorist acts on american soil since
SubredditDrama,removed,people try to gloss over the fact that muhammad married a year old and raped children
SubredditDrama,removed,obamaphones please tell me those are bright red phones that provide a direct line to the secret obama cave
SubredditDrama,removed,ive seen them argue that it isnt islamophobia because their fear is rational
SubredditDrama,removed,any reliable source you can find wikipedia pew research etc you caught me in the middle of writing my post i save and edit often in the first seconds because im on mobile so i corrected some typo crap which may have changed the context sorry
SubredditDrama,removed,there are so many people that you can find any kind of jackass now pardon me while i go to my jewish hitler appreciate group no one ever talks about the good things hitler cooked
SubredditDrama,removed,the muslim world has a huge amount of conservative people in it and the us is just ignoring them like they did with the hispanics this election because of culture
SubredditDrama,removed,man i love how the trump camp is totally not racist guys such an inclusive group jesus fucking christ though i dont even have sympathy for that guy he deserves to see who he stands with when he supports trump these are the people who want to shape americas future and its terrifying
SubredditDrama,removed,theres a mini civil war going on in atheism right now atheists tend to be more liberal and thus theres more sjws but at the same time they claim to be antireligion sjws tend to believe that islam is pretty high on the oppression olympics ladder which contradicts that whole atheist thing this ends up coming into conflict with itself as many sjw atheists are up their own ass with cognitive dissonance to act as the islam defense force
SubredditDrama,removed,you were brainwashed with islam and therefore is this information supposed to be of some useinterestworth
SubredditDrama,removed,you went to a muslim school and thereforewhat did you have a point why offer me totally useless information about yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,who said that
SubredditDrama,removed,nah only when leftists try to use human emotions as some sort of weapon
SubredditDrama,removed,according to the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination there is no difference between racial and ethnic discrimination and you might very well define muslims as members of an ethnoreligious group thus making it pretty much racist anyways
SubredditDrama,removed,make america gay allover
SubredditDrama,removed,those trump supporters are fucking scum racists and bigots who think they are arguing valid points hes just given the scum a voice and theyre hiding their bigotry less
SubredditDrama,removed,altreich ftfy
SubredditDrama,removed,as the last election proved equally is not an american value bigotry and hatred are
SubredditDrama,removed,reminds me of those jewish nazi supporters there was a great letter where a woman said that the nazis would be good because she was german first jewish second
SubredditDrama,removed,lol so much for not brigading you closeminded morons
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit those people are deluded theyll do anything to convince themselves theyre part of some superior sect of people and that muslims or immigrants or whoever they can group up is somehow inferior to them a bunch of children desperately trying to feel good about themselves by putting themselves above a bunch of strangers by default the way that thread played out is exactly how i picture the most stereotypical worst trump supporter except its basically all of them acting like that hilarious
SubredditDrama,removed,all trump supporters are bigots because they chose to support bigotry thats n o ta generalization thats a fact unless they were confused about what they were supporting and didnt understand trumps platform at all which is an incredibly small number of them that only voted for him on name recognition and didnt follow his campaign they are bigoted for what they support
SubredditDrama,removed,loldeadterrorists points minutes ago muslim all rape and murder or at the very least support it admit it why do yall want sharia law in the united states why do yall rape so much and ruin every country you move to why wont you go back where you came from i cant wait for trump to start deporting you people i know you said you are legal but im sure thats bullshit maga im not in favour of deportation but
SubredditDrama,removed,i know im sticking my dick in the ants nest here but im not supprised that muslims support trump both have sexist and facist ideologies aswell as both having supporters calling for violence against dissenters they could be the best of friends a disclaimer to keep me from being executed a majority of the muslim population in my country is voting on the left spectrum so i leave it to the individual not to be a shitty person despite the religion or ideology they were born into
SubredditDrama,removed,thats part of pol redpilling attack distract muddy the water being truthful is not useful if you worry about the truth too much you risk wasting time arguing with a smart person you dont need smart people you need an army of idiots who will dogpile and bully any link you share on reddit or irc no thats part of what leftists have been doing for a long time if you simply humiliate and make fun of your opponent you dont need to address their argument reasonably dont believe me recognize these neckbeard virgin doritos mountain dew fedora mra basement dweller misgoynist troll cis white male women wont fuck you racist sexist redneck the left created these tactics and the right simply adopted them kudos to having no self awareness though
SubredditDrama,removed,shits getting real hes trying to converse like a real adult
SubredditDrama,removed,someone needs to comission a study on trump supporters average brain mass in comparison to nontrump supporters i guarantee trump supporters have fewer brain cells
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck your dad
SubredditDrama,removed,dae voting for the iraq war with incomplete information is advocating to get into other wars
SubredditDrama,removed,the fact that that level of conversation is allowed is a black mark giving someone a platform to spew vile things then tuttutting them after their done is meaningless bs imo you are soft and weak and have terrible opinions
SubredditDrama,removed,uh oh a thread critical of islam lets see how srs responds
SubredditDrama,removed,lel always rich when euros think they can defend themselves without bug daddy america around to hold their binkies how did that intervention in libya go oh they ran out of munitions and ammo and had to buy some from the us
SubredditDrama,removed,smugging it up doesnt hide a nonanswer
SubredditDrama,removed,what the fuck i asked a person who identified as muslim feminist a question about islam why the fuck is that bigotry what is wrong with you can one not have a discussion with a muslim about their faith without talkjng about judaism and chritianity at the same time why exactly but at least you agree that islam discriminates against women so maybe you understand why asking a feminist who claims to follow islam how she reconciles the two is a sensible question
SubredditDrama,removed,who did i insult or make personal attacks the guy called me a retard and the worst i did was call him a useful idiot which is a political term not an insult
SubredditDrama,removed,dont do what here ive not insulted him despite him insulting me by calling me a retard why are you trying to police me when im the one being attacked
SubredditDrama,removed,i absolutely agree theladyeve great comment as usual and you are also very pretty
SubredditDrama,removed,this makes me cringe for society
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao i bet you think everyone that doesnt hate trump is conservative too right
SubredditDrama,removed,be quiet
SubredditDrama,removed,stop
SubredditDrama,removed,unfortunately things didnt go back to normal since he had suffered permanent damage iirc
SubredditDrama,removed,no awards for best titles
SubredditDrama,removed,actually i should give credit where credit is due i was alerted to this by by ushimunogora on heres an archive link
SubredditDrama,removed,from the news article i know the female starbucks barista was of legal age to date the man said i broke no laws i merely took a chance with my heart im tired of hearing the word creep as any black person or gay person is tired of hearing certain words i have a whole webpage dedicated to age gap love bucks says this guy has a reddit account
SubredditDrama,removed,pretty sure this guy qualifies
SubredditDrama,removed,this is one of the major contributing factors into why i voted for trump real tired of people not even trying to have a discussion because its beneath you fuuuuuuck that your opinion does not automatically have worth no one is obligated to engage with you when you say stupid shit try formulating an argument worth bothering with
SubredditDrama,removed,top posts from runexpectedoverwatch i am a bot messagecomposetokirkon
SubredditDrama,removed,you guys elected trump you literally got together and voted trump we dont need to say anything for lack of a better word america has given the world the greatest trump card imaginable we can now dismiss anything you guys say with that line besides you think canada had something to do with brexit you arent exactly what someone would call intelligent or even slightly informed
SubredditDrama,removed,and agreed with him on that
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks for the great discourse on politics udogdiarrhea ahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,as a trump supporter im loving the sectarianism in this thread keep it up liberals ivankas going to look great in that oval office come lmao
SubredditDrama,removed,reckoning with a majority of white people being actually bigoted as fuck has been very difficult for the left
SubredditDrama,removed,славная победа товарищ трамп
SubredditDrama,removed,ok ill just copy and paste this comment until youre ready to talk then
SubredditDrama,removed,youre talking to a commie who shitposts like he gives a shit about the democratic party hes against both major parties most likely
SubredditDrama,removed,white peoples feelings are the biggest victims of racism you should try and be more tolerant and understanding
SubredditDrama,removed,oh fuck off clinton lost agains donald fucking trump fuck her she is the reason the world now has to deal with a fucking manbaby as the most powerful man on earth again fuck her
SubredditDrama,removed,this is a good reply bravo regardless of them being qualified with far more hesitancy the leak source is remarkably similar and as such leaves room for an air of scepticism behind them im not saying russia didnt hack into the dnc im just saying there hasnt been enough publicly available evidence for one such as myself to blindly agree that russia dundiddit could take a lesson from you
SubredditDrama,removed,while the lgbt community has every right to be concerned being consumed by fear and hysteria is not going to help their cause honestly now would be a great time to plan an approach on the local municipal county and state level to maintain or set up prolgbt legislation examples would be for nondiscrimination clauses or some kind of domestic partnership setup that would be ready to go in the event obergefell and windsor are overturned assuming trump gets at least heritage foundation scotus picks
SubredditDrama,removed,so we get to criticize bernie for going on a jihad against th dnc instead of holding the l and staying focused on the republican opposition right
SubredditDrama,removed,this has nothing to do with being a woman i gurantee if a man like obama or romney pulled all the shit that she did that they would have been out of the race long before she did there are also an insane amount of woman who voted for heragainst trump from the primary fact that shes a woman and that trump has said countless fucked up things about females if anything the fact that she was a woman helped her immensely
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah that worked so well for us in the past just fuck off with the we gave them to much respect shit no we didnt the problem was that we treated them as a joke instead of actully caring about their issues
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah reading is dumb i get all the information i need from youtube videos and reddit titles but wow that is some rock solid completely legitimate evidence youve got there bud im convinced
SubredditDrama,removed,she also promised them jobs she had the backing of work in policy while trump lied to them lets not pretend they voted for him because he promised them jobs the nazism didnt hurt his chances there
SubredditDrama,removed,its organized
SubredditDrama,removed,there are just as many superdelegates today as there were last year the only thing the dnc learned was not to use email
SubredditDrama,removed,there are just as many superdelegates today as there were a year ago the only thing the dnc learned is not to use email
SubredditDrama,removed,whats with these kids that think you should always be able to do whatever you want wherever you want and face no repercussions i wish it was just kids check out trump and the trumplets for more on that bullshit i mean you can go back to all the senators who tried to impeach clinton getting caught in sexual scandals im sure there are tons more examples its a general problem with humanity
SubredditDrama,removed,failed neoliberal policies you mean the ones that got tens of millions of people at least some healthcare and prohibited companies from taking all your money all your life with healthcare premiums and then dumping you when you actually ask for coverage dude i could write out a long post telling you youre wrong and why but seriously just fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,im seeing it as a mix clearly the method the right has adopted works we treated some people with to much respect in that we expected theyd see through trumps obvious bullshit and conartistry surely they can see how declaring bankruptcy on the country is terrible and how tariffs wont bring back coal and manufacturing right wrong the gops method is treat them like their dumbasses and lie to their faces but you address their concerns in a way they want to hear hillary told them the truth coal and manufacturing are never going to come back like the ye olde days of the postwar boom but we can regear into sustainable energy and make new jobs but they didnt want to hear that we didnt address their concerns correctly
SubredditDrama,removed,is an electoral landslide
SubredditDrama,removed,fascism everyoneidisagreewithishitlerjpg
SubredditDrama,removed,good luck being a piece of shit helping to elect a literal fascist youre no better than actual nazi scum that supported him and you all will get what you deserve one day
SubredditDrama,removed,i love it when people take getting into good school seriously its like watching weeaboos acting as if they know how to use a katana leaving aside this asinine position that governance is some immutable force like the weather whats really naive about your position here is that people are up in arms about rising gas prices and not you know civil rights and class disparity and the like
SubredditDrama,removed,right its not like its really important jesus christ what a stupid ignorant privileged position this is
SubredditDrama,removed,i nominate the comments for managing in the space of only hours to be more shitty stupid and toxic than the thread that was linked we also had like reports in the queue of people in this thread reporting each others comments on the off chance i win this ill be giving the gold to the next runner up because its not fair for me to win gold in my own contest
SubredditDrama,removed,hes being downvoted for being smug about his indifference to politics that have very real effects on the lives of very real people im so glad you used your mod tag to defend his karma though
SubredditDrama,removed,human rights campaign coincidence i think not rthedumbass
SubredditDrama,removed,also ama
SubredditDrama,removed,this is drama you tard
SubredditDrama,removed,it is the perfect time for this
SubredditDrama,removed,academic feminism is nothing more than a distraction instead of focusing on the real issue of ceos sitting back and raking in obscene wealth on the backs of hard workers making slave wages they claim the real issue is there arent enough women ceos up there taking advantage of us brocialism or your issues are petty and will go away if we ignore them also what am solidarity
SubredditDrama,removed,he is not intelligent and he is not qualified in any field evolution is a lie
SubredditDrama,removed,what
SubredditDrama,removed,be careful watching that video in the op may make you want to kill yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,httpswwwredditcomrdirtymindbots rabiiiii dirtymindbot has returned
SubredditDrama,removed,no but that might be a smart idea usodiepawp given the war against christianity that continues to rage on this website and all across obamas america its just not safe to be a man of god and a supporter of mr donald trump these days
SubredditDrama,removed,you are calling swedes violent rapist pillagers
SubredditDrama,removed,it use to feature the niggers sub
SubredditDrama,removed,to be fair some rapes are better than others an year old having sex with a year old is rape in some states and is better than date rape which is better than a violent rape which is probably better than raping someone to death or raping a small child how is that controversial at all
SubredditDrama,removed,america has the best healthcare in the world are you retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,american healthcare is objectively the best in the world you just cant afford it
SubredditDrama,removed,ah yes a glimpse into the mind of a contributor to trp thedumbass tia and atheism they really have managed to combine that shittyness into one delightful ball of absolute tripe
SubredditDrama,removed,fu your fabrication damaged the election process disenfranchised liberals and harmed america how
SubredditDrama,removed,thats because your a stupid nigger though
SubredditDrama,removed,i think people who use mansplaining are assholes responding to them with stop cuntfusing the issue is valid
SubredditDrama,removed,no i genuinely dont care youre free to pretend that people with penises are women im free to call you a fucking lunatic for doing so
SubredditDrama,removed,this reminds me she thinks that small labia virgin human anatomy does not work like that
SubredditDrama,removed,is there any verification or is that sub just supposed to believe the trolling op is a whore
SubredditDrama,removed,if the op isnt getting a rise out of people then i feel bad for her youre free to do whatever you want but her actions will both affect her ability to pair bond as well as potentially chase off suitors that is unless she hides the fact that she let random dudes run train on her
SubredditDrama,removed,most people arent up for getting with the town bicycle if some chump does get tricked into dating her then hell leave asap if shes truthful that is unless he has zero selfrespect though
SubredditDrama,removed,because dating a serial whore lowers your status and people will think less of you for it she can do what she wants but shouldnt expect to have a happy relationship out of it unless she marries an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,ltr partners are one thing but a woman who does ons is low quality same goes for men also stop using suitor because you sound like a fedora wearing neckbeard idk why so many people defend whores lately i guess if you want to lick the scraps from someone else then go for it
SubredditDrama,removed,its not unhealthy to have standards and yes it is no stds no kids and am with a thin attractive woman whats funny is that shes the one who showed me the hilarious posts from rok sluthate and fph rip
SubredditDrama,removed,she is spoiled goods but she can do whatever she wants those are mutually exclusive terms dosh khaleen in vaes dothrak wow shaming people with nerd terms visceral
SubredditDrama,removed,just because im bi doesnt mean ill fuck anything i may be into incest and beastiality but not shemales im getting some really strong transphobia vibes here maybe thats just me but when youre into fucking an animal more than a human i think theres something wrong there
SubredditDrama,removed,le redditeeeeeeuuuuuurrrrs
SubredditDrama,removed,if you said the same thing about a muslim this sub would lose its shit lol
SubredditDrama,removed,i know people are uncomfortable with the idea of killing police officers for political reasons but i also dont like the idea of denying africanamericans the dignity of resisting their oppressors when there seems to be no peaceful path to ending police brutality indeed i think a peaceful black lives matter would have a much more compelling message to white people if they stood in contrast with a black terrorist movement with more radical goals and methods sort of like how malcolm x played bad cop to martin luther kings good cop in the black freedom movement in any case while these police officers who died in dallas may well not have personally been guilty of brutality against blacks i dont think thats a worthwhile distinction to make when ones community is being occupied by a hostile military force in war we dont have any qualms about attacking uniformed members of the enemy even if those particular soldiers have not visited any violence upon us
SubredditDrama,removed,she literally beats most olympians in most swimming events including men are you trolling she would love against most men in swimming events

SubredditDrama,removed,lol those fags are obsessed with usm i received a notification ban a few days before the ascension of god emperor from the mods of renoughtrumpspam when i had never ever visited that subreddit lol low testorenone men behaving like menopausical women not a good mix
SubredditDrama,removed,typical dumbass broad holy shit are you for real
SubredditDrama,removed,okay what ever makes you feel better maybe you shouldnt get so bent out of shape over dumb shit like someone preferring not to play with girls next time ill put a trigger warning in my comment so it doesnt hurt your feelings
SubredditDrama,removed,spez admits to editing some comments on rtheronald
SubredditDrama,removed,haha iran is shia tho not muslim
SubredditDrama,removed,like its mentioned all the time on rthedonald renoughtrumpspam etc
SubredditDrama,removed,rpizzagate rip rpizzagate i hope the popcorn in heaven tastes good i guess i cant link to threads there
SubredditDrama,removed,i think of it like this if youre going to eat a sandwich you just enjoy it more if you knew no one had fucked it melania trump
SubredditDrama,removed,this was said by the guy who started the conversation about how white people are in imminent danger from uh whatever the sjws i guess based on how many people were run over by trucks or suicide bombed in the past year ill let you take a guess on what they should be afraid of obviously its brexit and trump because raisins
SubredditDrama,removed,oh yeah obviously all leftwing folks support those crazy things like gender shit and whatever just like all rightwing folks are hardcore nazis there is no middle ground the world is black and white only a sith deals in absolutes you fucking retard seriously cant you see through your own shit and if you think the left attacks people for different opinions ive got news for you there is a fucking reason why thedonald isnt allowed to fuck with rpolitics anymore and surprise its because they attack people and the last time i checked trump is rightwing the only conclusion ive been getting out of this election is that most americans are shortsighted idiots who live and breathe propaganda and are thus so far disconnected from reality a disaster wiping them all out may be our best chance of global peace

SubredditDrama,removed,i kike that we have established person a trying to stir shit up and person b being a nazi as the two possibilities in a binary situation if m night were here the twist would be that the one guy is trying to stir shit up and the other guy is a nazi no one would see it coming
SubredditDrama,removed,whats wrong with being opposed to a shitty backwards ideology no more wrong with hating islam than there is in hating fascism or communism
SubredditDrama,removed,all right so ill touch your dick without your consent with no witnesses and if you stick by your lame principles you wont do anything if you do then you should perhaps review your principles
SubredditDrama,removed,usually but what if you have a system that is very organized but systematically biased against certain groups in such a case is it not acceptable to go outside the system to get justice
SubredditDrama,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrqreudpuklm
SubredditDrama,removed,theres no medal for street shitting
SubredditDrama,removed,jesus do you even read what you write the lack of selfawareness you have is staggering your making this a black and white issue as in theres right and wrong not a racial thing which im sure your gonna call me a racist again for saying that when its not so if a group invaded your country or came over you would open them with open arms and change your life because someone different is there that is why europe is falling and why they have attacks on their soil by immigrants on a almost weekly basis thats like if i went to japan and wanted everyone to change to accommodate me im guessing you believe those riots in milwaukee werent racist even though blacks are caught on video going get him hes white not to overuse a good term but your nothing but a weak willed limp wristed faggot who would rather bend over for stuff he had no part in than fighting for whats white oops i ment right sorry my racism is seeping through again lololol
SubredditDrama,removed,youre overthinking it they just said something deliberately edgy and offensive knowing exactly what reaction they were going to get because it feels good to be the center of attention when you feel like you deserve to be the dogpiling was the point
SubredditDrama,removed,well unlike dumb faggots like you i know when my point isnt getting across to someone who refuses to look at a problem from another point of view than their own so rather than waste any more time on even attempting to explain why your wrong im just gonna let you be another victim of the world your trying to bring in and be manipulated by the only other sorry your gonna get of me is that of sorry im not gonna spend any more time with you as i have better things to do like bask and enjoy all my white privilege and going to a good ole fashioned fag drag tonight woooo fag drag
SubredditDrama,removed,whatever faggot get that precious last word in so you can feel superior over someone once in your life
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know anything about how to fix you know the world but regards the idea that complex problems several simple problems i have an interesting irl anecdote which shows that is not true as interacting with complex systems means changing one thing can have unexpected outcomes due to interacting feedback loops problem river floods causing flood damage to properties solution build levee result increased flood damage wtf feedback loop responsible the levee does reduce flooding for a while so people build more where previously they wouldnt eventually when the river floods over the top of the levee the flood damage is way higher than if no levee had been built so now you solve the next simple problem of blah blah blah i dont care thats not my point my point is that a complex system is not the same as several simple systems they have emergent unintuitive properties and should be engaged with that understanding
SubredditDrama,removed,no u r
SubredditDrama,removed,so this account im on right now got banned from srd and i posted with another account saying hey you should ban this account as well and then oxus got that account permanently banned from all of reddit for ban evasion

SubredditDrama,removed,indians are contributing to america so much learn morehttpvisahouseinstudyinusa
SubredditDrama,removed,youre going full passiveaggressive now thats good it shows youre flustered youre still to chickenshit to actually call the guy a rapist because that has a social consequences for you he was acquitted you dont know what actually happened that opens you up to criticism i mean it sounds like he raped his girlfriend while she was passed out and let his friend have his way with her i have no problem saying that hes probably a rapist who got away with it but i dont know that assuming it is true his crocodile tears mean nothing regardless of how you frame it assuming he is innocent he owes nothing to you to society and especially nothing to his accuser the funny thing is you accuse him of making it about him which is a complaint that only has any meaning if he actually is a rapist which youre too chickenshit to assert but what youre really doing is making it about you youre mad that your outrage and the outrage of the accusations are themselves evidence feminist camp isnt being recognized youre mad that hes not following your script that your norms arent societys norms youre mad that hes still acting like hes right and youre wrong and since hes innocenthe got away with it there is nothing you can do to change that
SubredditDrama,removed,also why am i the bad guy here when i posted a picture of an activity i enjoy and get a bunch of comments on whats in my shorts instead of the activity itself and i respond to some of them in a mildly frustrated manner omg did he just get to experience what its like to be a woman posting a pic of herself on the internet doing any inane thing and then getting frustrated at the objectifying comments ii think he did
SubredditDrama,removed,teenage communists with no skin in the game talking about revolution do not speak for the working poor the marginalized people of color or any of it hey now being privileged and claiming to speak on behalf of the oppressed is a proud leftist pastime started by marx and engels themselves show some respect
SubredditDrama,removed,he was cyber bullied when he was a little girl

SubredditDrama,removed,why do all these fucking white reddit posters care what goes on in detroit its not like they are ever going to to there for such a superior race white people sure are a bunch of pussies
SubredditDrama,removed,the entire news world has been talking about the stanford rape case for months what the fuck are you talking about
SubredditDrama,removed,gamers are the worst this is also why i laugh when ggers try to claim that their targets are just making it up when they say that they receive death threats or are making their own
SubredditDrama,removed,shoot yourself faggot ill die decades after your retarded ass does
SubredditDrama,removed,ask japan what they did to china and korea i bet they wont admit to anything

SubredditDrama,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikieugenicsintheunitedstatesinfluenceonnazigermany after the eugenics movement was well established in the united states it spread to germany again you have no business talking about anything you are an embarrassment to the whole american race after the eugenics movement was well established in the united states it spread to germany you are literally retarded

SubredditDrama,removed,these subs are destructive you laugh at people you see inferior and for what cheap entertainment shame on you for contributing to this lol based on your post history im not sure what you are attacking this guy for
SubredditDrama,removed,yes im aware that people make threats all the time here but why do you guys take yourselves so seriously you so smugly act as if you guys are the moral ones while people tell me to kill myself get a fucking life rather than taking time out of your day to go thru my post history and threaten me
SubredditDrama,removed,so objectification isnt a form of sexism
SubredditDrama,removed,first flour i picked for your mother was white and bleached just like her asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,it comes from that anyone who disagrees with our side is just evil echochamber that these sorts of debates tend to generate
SubredditDrama,removed,are you seriously incapable of considering that perspectives other than your american perspective exist why do you think the whole debate doesnt happen here because we have too few theocrat wannabes
SubredditDrama,removed,or by
SubredditDrama,removed,lol im just being retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,memes are the best if they incorporate the people behind gulags and stuff incorporating kkk members now youre a racist
SubredditDrama,removed,does it matter they still exist what is srds obsession with pretending they dont
SubredditDrama,removed,i like how you try to bring it back to the thread topic when you clearly werent talking about that
SubredditDrama,removed,christ its alarming how everyone has become racists in the eyes of srd
SubredditDrama,removed,also the pledge of allegiance is not brainwashing

SubredditDrama,removed,jesus i mean fine points but lol this thread has crawled even further down the shithole
SubredditDrama,removed,pretty normal childhood and surprisingly apparently i managed to make it through without committing a sex crime or causing significant and longterm harm to really anyone and this whole everyone is dumb as a kid everyone makes mistakes judge not lest ye be judged argument really makes me curious what the fuck you all did when you were that the prospect of punishing this guy for distributing child pornography makes you uncomfortable the only way i can imagine someone arriving at kids will be kids for sex crimes is if they did something pretty awful as a teen
SubredditDrama,removed,the problem comes when people like ujebusgobson bans people for even mentioning this child brides sometimes tolerated in nordic asylum centers despite bans apparently wanting to ban childbrides even in refugee centers makes you a racist and a part of soldiers of odin or something
SubredditDrama,removed,per his httpwwwhideyourdrinkcomcontacthtml scroll down to contact us you can also call or text anytime my names ryan and im the owner of this disgusting site and no i dont care about your children so spare me
SubredditDrama,removed,you identify as a retard
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao everyone is racist panic
SubredditDrama,removed,im pointing out that you think everything is racist is that a problem you are the boy that cried wolf you probably think the use of boy there is racist
SubredditDrama,removed,k bye
SubredditDrama,removed,frankl wrote about exactly that but to many people their thoughts and feelings arent choices that they make im reminded of tony soprano lamenting the loss of the worlds gary coopers it used to be chic to be the strong silent type and there were problems associated with that but now its chic in some crowds to be the most offended and outraged and theres problems associated with that too
SubredditDrama,removed,you do it every day here
SubredditDrama,removed,meanwhile when someone says man you killed that guy no one cares because its rightfully seen figuratively meanwhile if you say man you raped that guy somewhere someone whines about being offended
SubredditDrama,removed,rape culture what you mean like israelis
SubredditDrama,removed,cmon and take a look hes got gigantic balls plus his money keeps flowin like niagara falls we all know jesus saves and ludacris withdraws im bout to go on vacation blow it out ya ass

SubredditDrama,removed,ig anything that thread proves again the only people other than motorcyclists more disconnected from reality of how their toys impact others are pitbull owners
SubredditDrama,removed,this site is so autistic sometimes look everyone this person has said things in the past that we disagree with now get the outsider how pathetic do you have to be to go digging through the post history of the author of every comment you read
SubredditDrama,removed,here sure but just out in the wild that there are people who do this as a habit is slightly disturbing and makes me wish mandatory assisted suicide was a thing
SubredditDrama,removed,die addicts can live a long time and im the bad guy here that dewd literally believes that around of americans are sub humans and he wants to vote for a president who says racist things constantly and encourages it in his voters being a jerk is one thing being a racist piece of shit that does not deserved to be pissed on if on fire is entirely different
SubredditDrama,removed,its not just about voting he is a racist cunt also if he was voting for trump out of some believe in conservative economic policies i could let that pass i mean thats a legitimate political difference that fact that he is also racist count to boot seals the deal for me and i dont wish him to die id like to see him get sober get hooked again go through withdrawals get sober get hooked again etc rinse and repeat until he is no longer a racist then he can be sober for as long as he is alive
SubredditDrama,removed,addiction is shitty i have close family members who deal with it everyday that being said i dont have sympathy for racists who believe that subjugating more than half the global population based on there skin color either especially these days when trump might actually win there is consequences to shitty ideas like racism
SubredditDrama,removed,i hate the alternative right so much but as long as they make degenerates like you have a harder time in life i support their existence
SubredditDrama,removed,umistakenotdotdotdot is a retard
SubredditDrama,removed,terrible ideologies coming from a cuckold hahaha i would tell you to kill yourself but i want you live so that hopefully someone might kill you someday just more painfully
SubredditDrama,removed,the solution to caring too much about what women think of you is to care even harder about what the most judgmental women think of you this is what feminists actually believe
SubredditDrama,removed,safe spaces are for cucks and liberals we just need an area where we are not in danger of being called out for our retarded and hateful views a nondangerous area if you will to keep safe space cucks out
SubredditDrama,removed,but trump held up a flag why are all these faggots whining didnt they see trump held a flag fuckin faggots
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know what youre talking about face it dude youre just a dravidian whos uncomfortable with his dark skin and ape like looks the fact there was a region called aryavarta clearly shows that there was a group of people who called themselves aryans in fact your paper mentions many different groups migrating into the subcontinent youre clutching at straws mate because youre uncomfortable with your looks and youre trying to espouse some theory that all indians look alike haha
SubredditDrama,removed,he also doesnt believe lesbians exist and he doesnt like anyone who isnt a christian gay rights are detrimental to humanity naw man hes just saying being gay is hard okay
SubredditDrama,removed,no they fucking dont youre a goddamned liar or youre even dumber than seems humanly possible
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont go on the td and im not trolling were literally in a thread started by use of the word in an antitrump context just because you say its not up for debate doesnt mean youre correct its actually all over this comment section your bias is showing
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,or not a fucking nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,im not afraid of muslims i as an american hear the left say no muslim wants sharia law and i hear the right saying they want it everywhere on earth i simply asked how many wanted it i know its barbaric and anyone who supports it is supporting brutal treatment of all women and non muslims basically only muslim men have a good life under sharia law everyone else is killed for doing anything and a tasteless joke about niggers there are niggers in every race ignorant people thats a nigger theyre racist for assuming nigger means black person
SubredditDrama,removed,get a education friend so you can add more to the argument than that
SubredditDrama,removed,well if the opposing view is purposely trying to doxx people hell yes
SubredditDrama,removed,you offer nothing to society come back to this conversation when your balls drop
SubredditDrama,removed,hey look a nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck nazis
SubredditDrama,removed,when you have to lie so egregiously about your opposition do you ever ask yourself if you are actually the good guys are you just in need of an enemy because your candidate lost the election
SubredditDrama,removed,cry more you fascist faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,there is no such thing as peace loving muslims where ever muslims are the majority they set their own rule of law most of that billion muslims live in war torn shit countries
SubredditDrama,removed,hey td last time i checked cuck betas were the guys getting it not the ones giving it shhh dont scream heres a piece of leather to bight down on enjoy your time on the bottom
SubredditDrama,removed,if hate speech is wrong ban every single subreddit that discusses black lives matter white privilege or what have you cause as a white person im tired of the double standard im no supremacist but if you are going to crack down on racial discrimination do the same for subreddits that say hateful things about white people yes its still racist when you generalize someone by skin color
SubredditDrama,removed,they praised nazis you know the ones who are known for committing genocide oh youve defended them before yuck
SubredditDrama,removed,heres the reason why it was banned in case anyone was wondering
SubredditDrama,removed,notice how her charity died right after she wasnt voted in that bitch was soooo corrupt on top of that she cheated burn out with competition she deserves to burn at the stake but thats not how we do things nowadays trump although is laying the foundation for her day in court
SubredditDrama,removed,youre the first person to take a nuanced approach thank you from the bottom of my heart this thread was fucking infuriating till you showed up cards on the table raltright was openly racist not in the pejorative sense though at least not primarily as far as i can tell being racists just means believing in racial differences and the data that ive seen seems to indicate that there are very significant differences between races and it just makes intuitive sense there are no asians in the olympic dash for a reason the races evolved in vastly different environments and i honestly think its foolish to assume were all the same in every way despite that
SubredditDrama,removed,well we are though even though i prefer countersemitic why is it such a desirable thing to be prosemitic
SubredditDrama,removed,and then they labeled you a nazi and said shit well im fucked
SubredditDrama,removed,hush little trumpkin dont say a word donalds promises are only deferred and if those promises wont come true i guess youre the cuck haha fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,it doesnt matter that they deleted the sub it doesnt make muslims any less inferior and it doesnt change the fact that trump is potus long live the alt right long live trump
SubredditDrama,removed,telling someone to kill the selves what the hell did you expect retard
SubredditDrama,removed,but we bomb the shit out of muslims i dont understand you man
SubredditDrama,removed,antiracist kkk thats cool im racialistic myself since thats how people actually think in rl im just going to ask you again since you seem to want to dodge cum stain im antisemitic youre position is opposite of mine right k so therefore why are you prosemitic
SubredditDrama,removed,youre wrong faggots and jews are not welcome in the movement they are who we are fighting against milo is both
SubredditDrama,removed,if any rational conservatives or pollacks want a place to post and discuss conservative politics without being told what to think me at rthelowroadtoscotland
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks for your response someone has to go to bed so they can go to work tomorrow morning and help pay for muslims with a grade education to come into the country and wish death to all nonbelievers fuck you in a couple years this paragraph will make sense you idiot research the french a couple years ago and how they felt about bringing in muslims but keep in mind the result of doing so
SubredditDrama,removed,you say it like its a bad thing
SubredditDrama,removed,then dont use it moron
SubredditDrama,removed,dude they labeled a jewish black cockloving homosexual a nazi you really think youre above it all dont you
SubredditDrama,removed,i couldnt give two shits about if someone is jewish or not fair enough if thats the case why is it so important to defend them you seem to really be up in arms about the plight of that poor wittle uberrich heavily politically connected and significantly influential ethnic minority a position that can only be held by brains produced by systematic inbreeding by the way not cool man what do you have against most jews nobody but illiterates believe in race anymore not cool man what do you have against most asians africans middle easterners and latin americans
SubredditDrama,removed,they just want the raltrights voice heard i mean nazis have opinions and feelings too
SubredditDrama,removed,but the posts i saw in that sub denied the holocaust were the arguments factually inacurate were arguing for eugenics god forbid we improve the human race you ever watch idiocracy you really want the future to be inherited by stupid rednecks just because they cant figure out a condom discussing how to make the us a pure white state la raza discusses how to make the southern us a pure mestizo state we want a homeland for our people europe is in the process of cultural suicide so we may need make our home in the usa so yeah while i dont recall the suggestions of a firing squad the discussions were equally terrifying youre a pussy then
SubredditDrama,removed,wow ok so i guess you really are autisticassburgers sorry i didnt mean to make fun of disability earlier is your mom around i have her number somewhere in my contacts for no particular reason i can call her for if you want big guy
SubredditDrama,removed,oh sorry i didnt finish that with zionist plus thanks for proving my point nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,seeing all of the smug faggots in this thread just make me hate this website even more
SubredditDrama,removed,im not american retard trust me you havent lived till the fash gets bashed had racist thugs try and mess with a coworker the thing you learn about these guys is that they are weaklings that only feel safe in groups take that away and they are much less likely to abuse others and being against political violence doesnt make me a nazi it does make you an authoritarian shitbird guess vets are shitbirds then and anyone that fights isis
SubredditDrama,removed,nah cunt were here to stay whitey coming for your toothbrush and your lilly white daughter white genocide now
SubredditDrama,removed,nazis hate milo doesnt happen youre sure about that huh it doesnt take half a brain to figure out who is a nazi and who isnt youd call your own grandparents nazis even if they fought nazis if they inconvenienced your world view x says we need to cleanse our country of all the jews andor monkeys right by getting the fuck out going to their own countries kinda like how lincoln desired to send freed blacks back to africa or how most jews want palestinians to leave their homes so that they can have all that shitty land is he a nazi or not hes an ethnic nationalist if you wanna get technical you probably dont because youre an asshole a national socialist would be someone who is specifically in opposition to finance capitalism marxianbased socialism in favor of a raciallyoriented variant of socialism and typically supports things like pangermanism the absolute abolition of democracy and the racial theory that germans specifically are the descendants of an ancient master race during the time of the indoeuropeans
SubredditDrama,removed,a human construct largely based on phenotypes and not actual genetic study this so fucking stupid its unbelievable i cant convince you of something you dont want to believe though if you ever try to challenge your own ideas this narrative wont last long hes conflating race with things like national identity and culture theyre not separate and they never have been
SubredditDrama,removed,i guarantee you had tears in your eyes when trump got elected
SubredditDrama,removed,social circumstances how do these circumstances come into being people are not powerless to affect their circumstances you know there are no asians in that olympic sport because theres no culture for it less or no grassroots track programs compared to countries with deeply ingrained systems im pretty sure the act of running isnt exactly a cultural phenomena lol i doubt kenyans have the resources to fund grassroots support anyway the reality is that asians have short legs because they are genetically shorter you have to do some serious mental gymnastics to avoid that fact i wouldnt trust a single piece of data you found in that intellectually corrupt shithole youre assuming i get all my information from raltright thats retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off fascist 😘
SubredditDrama,removed,i wouldnt say he legitimizes that behavior but i would say that he is a white president being elected after we just had a black president and thats going to get a reaction not matter what
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you fash
SubredditDrama,removed,its probably true though whats your fucking problem youre telling me you guys dont sweat over your computers day and night looking for little things to gloat at us about i already know the answer is yes since the entirety of reddit has been proving that to me for the past few hours
SubredditDrama,removed,no buddy fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,cry more snow flake
SubredditDrama,removed,you didnt think about posts with titles like hey rall getting to rall that was the entire point of them the post with that that title is the highest post of all time for the sub td is intentionally antagonistic towards the rest of the site and then you clutch your pearls and play victim when we call you out its tiresome
SubredditDrama,removed,i like how you think white people are evil for wanting their own sovereign nations
SubredditDrama,removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeee ujournalismisdead
SubredditDrama,removed,im already mellow as fuck man come back with an actual point faggot insults over the internet mean less than nothing
SubredditDrama,removed,here let me tag him here you go
SubredditDrama,removed,hahaha yeah trump supporters are so mad that uspez is banning their shit and now milos speech has been shutdown by our communist brothers and sisters who lit fires and rioted in protest i heard milo was almost killed after they breached the first floor of the university we are winning
SubredditDrama,removed,why are you pronazi though
SubredditDrama,removed,youre not liberal youre a subhuman authoritarian leftist dog and you guys are losing where it matters trump won and no amount of screeching and bitching from fat dykes like yourself is going to change that thank you for giving trump a second term keep on being an obnoxious subhuman it is a great help
SubredditDrama,removed,freedom of speech is a classical liberal value modern leftists are authoritarian subhumans
SubredditDrama,removed,nigga not nigger completely different words
SubredditDrama,removed,you can ban a sub but you cant stop me from gassing the kikes and starting a race war now
SubredditDrama,removed,quiet retard let the adults talk

SubredditDrama,removed,i have umortalsisyphus tagged as person who wouldnt show his study on the relation between race and crime not sure if i can remember the debate i had with him i debate people on reddit almost every other day but if i tagged him its likely because he wasnt using sources for some outrageous claims not exactly an independent and free thinker
SubredditDrama,removed,i hope you die on your way to the hospital when some blm fuckheads block the highway
SubredditDrama,removed,thats some fucking willful ignorance if ive ever seen it tens of millions died during the great leap forward tens of millions died during engineered famines in the ussr and something like a fifth of cambodia during the khmer rouge genocide but no stalin did nothing wrong hehe xd you faggots are just as deluded as the people from raltright and i have literally no clue how you can pretend to be on some moral high ground like jesus id bet youd be more concerned over me using the fword than the hundreds of millions that died due to your fucked up ideology oh but mr internet man what about the rape of the belgian congo or the british raj lets just move the goalposts again so we can pretend that communism is fucking grand for the people underneath it lets just throw out some red herrings and hope that people dont remember what the stasi did in eastern germany or the existence of gulags yall niggas must want a new era of mccarthyism im sure you wont try to revise that portion of history faggot

SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you reddit take responsibility as a major source for news and political discussion twitter already failed and facebook has been using shady censoring too free speech is important and its depressing that the wisdom in the famous quote from evelyn beatrice hall has become lost upon a generation of millennials i dont agree with what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it today its i am triggered so im gonna shut you up i also think its okay to beat you for what you just said
SubredditDrama,removed,unfortunately delusional morons who are nazis dont speak any other language so violence it is its not like anybody challenges their opinion of anime body pillows being great girlfriends thats fine the other races are inferior to the white aryan part where careful consideration ends and punches need to be thrown
SubredditDrama,removed,captain america is a cartoon were you expecting the guy who did the punching to challenge that dickhead nazi to a duel or something he saw his chance and took it and it was great and that shitbag nazi isnt meaningless hes getting more followers everyday the world would be genuinely better off if all these people were dead were watching the inexplicable rise of nazis and fascists and theyre even worse than the first time because they know exactly what horrors the nazis committed and they love them even parts of the wehrmacht had the flimsy excuse that they didnt know about the holocaust and other casual nazi butchery which i dont believe for a second but these dickheads cant even say that
SubredditDrama,removed,the only thing we ever asked for was the right to avoid nonwhites since that wont happen there will be war
SubredditDrama,removed,now if only we can ban them from breathing
SubredditDrama,removed,already have a white nation just need to kick out the invaders
SubredditDrama,removed,edit looks like some of the community can be a bit dickish aka reddit this whole exchange was just unnecessary butthurt aka reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,thats bullshit the sub was objectively getting far less content and driving away regular users last time they expanded the rules there were far more people complaining about the lack of content than the reverse quit pretending that anyone who likes content and brining in new users is an agenda poster
SubredditDrama,removed,so i should be tolerant of someone who says all niggers kikes and chinks are subhuman and should be killed youre deluded
SubredditDrama,removed,niggers are an inferior race
SubredditDrama,removed,u dumbfuck dont ever call me altright again or link to one of my posts again u piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,these are anarchists using the formerly peaceful protest as a springboard to smash shit up and people as for the second seems like a lot more lefties have been beating the shit out of people this year than trump supporters have
SubredditDrama,removed,gay guy who promotes not being a special snowflake and behaving like an adult instead of crying like a baby
SubredditDrama,removed,yes its the flamboyant rightwing twatwwffle thats indefensible here not the crowd beating the shit out of people
SubredditDrama,removed,milo nazi lol
SubredditDrama,removed,i didnt realize a flamboyant gay idiot that likes to fetishize black men could be a nazi what are they on board because his degeneracy wont make black babies or would actual nazis wanna kill him too
SubredditDrama,removed,you do realize thats like half my point
SubredditDrama,removed,yes its his fault anarchists cant control themselves and beat the shit out of people
SubredditDrama,removed,canipunchnaziscom is actually banned
SubredditDrama,removed,yes its his fault and plan that anarchists riot and beat the shit out of people
SubredditDrama,removed,oh so hes an uncle tom too yah know im mostly shitposting and poking the hornets nest but for real hows he a nazi its not like im really a fan hes an obnoxious twat and im not really conservative but what specifically makes him a nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,lol
SubredditDrama,removed,you should punch him right lets see how apologetic this thread will be when leftists are the cause of violence meanwhile punch nazis everyone
SubredditDrama,removed,what in his retarded ideology even comes close to approaching the evil genocidal beliefs of nazism
SubredditDrama,removed,my point is that if obama went to some uber conservative place and people who went to go see him speak got beaten we wouldnt be saying he went there for a reaction
SubredditDrama,removed,dude is a retarded troll dont engage dis is why trump won
SubredditDrama,removed,thats consistent and fair i still disagree and think wouldnt be fair to moore to say he expected redneck violent trash to beat his attendees in a hypothetical speech in a very conservative place but cheers for being reasonable in srd these days and sorry for being an ass to you
SubredditDrama,removed,how is he a white supremacist
SubredditDrama,removed,how is he a fascist can you point his explicit efforts for a totalitarian state
SubredditDrama,removed,two wrongs make a right
SubredditDrama,removed,fair enough
SubredditDrama,removed,the other poster already told this doesnt matter but hes gay and jewish irrc do you think the alt right accepts him and can you point out specifically something hes done that makes him a nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,good to see the slippery slope arguments from last week are coming true yes milo and his supporters are magically all nazi now so its ok to punch them
SubredditDrama,removed,ive brought it up twice and i dont believe its weak to point out that the group you say hes a part of wants him gassed exactly how and what does he do to support the tenants of white nationalism financially and with his words
SubredditDrama,removed,p sure there were more beatings of random people wearing trump gear and shit
SubredditDrama,removed,lol yes its okay that idiots beat the shit out of people outside trump rallies all year because some white trash shot some people
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks for an actual answer
SubredditDrama,removed,he wont cut himself hell cut some liberals who deserve it for enabling fascists
SubredditDrama,removed,i didnt use worse i said more as in more often more times you even qouted it so im not sure why you changed the words later
SubredditDrama,removed,i said more as in more often more times you can stop pretending that i said bearings were more serious than shootings
SubredditDrama,removed,did you miss all the beatings and riots all through the primaries and general election
SubredditDrama,removed,what is this image problem personally i think violent intolerance of fascism is a pretty good image
SubredditDrama,removed,they do condoleeza rice also gets shut down as do plenty of other normal right wing speakers im not gonna bother looking for more examples because im lazy people dont understand that one of the things driving milos success is that normal conservatives have been shut out of liberal colleges so often that throwing a pipe bomb in the form of milo is extra appealing to college republican groups
SubredditDrama,removed,lol
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off with your pragmatism i could care less if trump genocides gays and retards and minorities i just want people to know im opposed to him because hes a nazi and im morally virtuous
SubredditDrama,removed,lol
SubredditDrama,removed,calling trump supporters stupid or pointing out the factual inaccuracies you base your beliefs on isnt the same thing as doxxing you dumb fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,what about dese guys
SubredditDrama,removed,hell black bloc probably cheered at trumps berkeley funding threat the guidebook of terrorism tries to prod the state into a disproportionate response in order to mobilize the populace against the state its working on me between this and texass sanctuary city bullshit i see a concentrated effort to funnel tax money away from liberal areas and that makes me want to start throwing bricks fuckers are trying to harm us for our political beliefs this is how republics die and ill happily help kill it if it goes down how republicans want
SubredditDrama,removed,my only regret is that no one got to beat the shit out of him god knows he deserves it i have a feeling the next years are going to be violent
SubredditDrama,removed,hey thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because there is not enough drama to merit an srd submission please wait and see if things develop further or look for a subthread with more drama make sure youre linking with the proper context events such as x sub was hacked or y sub was made private are not drama in and of themselves do not just link to a subreddit that was taken over if there are dramatic happenings around the takeover please make a self post and include links to drama that users can read for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,removed,i also think it was a serious effort to avoid that and a mod can manually approve submissions to that site and im gonna gorge
SubredditDrama,removed,depends what you define as peaceful and violent are you just trying to pretend you dont hate protesters by saying you like peaceful protests
SubredditDrama,removed,the antisemites have the right to deny you for any of the other subs covering this dramatic happening i think i will not stop
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahahahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,a very open gay person that hates gay people thats a first add to the fact that all the top comments here are anti milo and not actually addressing the real issue of people becoming violent to suppress free speech really tells you what type of demographic this subreddit appeals to keep up the circlejerk rsubredditdrama perhaps if you get enough imaginary points people will actually believe using violence to get your idea noticed is a good thing
SubredditDrama,removed,if everyone totally ignored him hed lose this way he wins yup dont mind me and sorry for being an ass to you just shitposting to bother the bash the fash and everything rightwing is nazism so its okay they beat random trumpets crowds
SubredditDrama,removed,at forty seconds in you can see a man on the ground not moving with blood by his head

SubredditDrama,removed,l o l
SubredditDrama,removed,and then tell me all about how everyone should punch nazis and also im a nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,classy act umortalsisyphus take no responsibility for the fact that your sub was a cesspool of bigotry hatred intolerance witch hunts accusations lies name calling and misleading information instead you direct the blame towards the platform that allowed you to exercise your freedom of speech and to exchange thoughts with those that shared your political ideology if reddit were out to get you they would have shut your shit show down a long time ago they had plenty of opportunities to do so but no they tolerated you despite everything reddit didnt force members of both your sub and rthedonald to systematically troll other subs and harass their users to the extent that you did in all my time on reddit i have never seen a gathering of so many intolerant and combative users in one place at the same time your sub attracted the very worst that reddit has to offer in fact im absolutely convinced that some of your subscribers had no interest in politics one way or the other and werent really all that impressed with trumps campaign the only reason they joined was so they could partake in all the trolling and harassment they so enjoy that was coming out of your camp its not reddits fault that your sub drew in those types of people or that you werent able to take control of the situation and discourage what they were doing that was on you reddit didnt ban your sub because of some political agenda they shut your sub down because the bigotry hatred and intolerance that your sub was founded upon was seeping out into the rest of the site and was creating a very hostile environment be a man and take responsibility i know its not just your fault for the way things got but you were in a position where you could have taken a far more sterner approach towards the trouble your sub was causing but you didnt
SubredditDrama,removed,filthy filthy liberal good job bashing the fash tho and making easy propaganda for the right to take more of the senate in
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,god this websites obsession with free speech is getting more cultish every day
SubredditDrama,removed,get the fuck out
SubredditDrama,removed,depends what you define as peaceful and violent its not how one of us defines peaceful and violent its how it should be defined there are objectively peaceful and objectively violent protests are you just trying to pretend you dont hate protesters by saying you like peaceful protests you are insinuating that he doesnt actually like protestors which is not at all what he is saying he made the distinction and you are accusing him of disliking protestors in general
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck yeah bash the fash
SubredditDrama,removed,the only sad thing about this is that the antifa didnt die of his wounds
SubredditDrama,removed,not if they voted for trump
SubredditDrama,removed,reading that dialogue i seriously want to punch him in the face holy shit what a fucking sack of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,i used to be antiracism until a black person made fun of me
SubredditDrama,removed,please spare me the hand wringing this does at least as much to show that we will not sit by and watch fascists and their propagandists use our spaces or organize in public with impunity he was made a martyr when they banned him from twitter too but that was still a huge blow to his outreach potential he gained support for so long because he says outrageously bigoted things out in the open to piss people off and he was beloved for his seeming invulnerability to any real consequence now theres consequences now the story is no longer what he says but the fact that hes been denied a chance to say it id say thats a good step forward
SubredditDrama,removed,theyre automatons led by a drugaddicted lunatic who looked like charlie chaplin you shouldnt expect them to be good at anything
SubredditDrama,removed,and people became sympathetic towards him thanks to it fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,putting my penis in girls buttholes is symbolic of how society has turned to shit

SubredditDrama,removed,virtue signal you mean being leftwing in public i dont think making the world a better place is possible unless you call shitty people out on their shit and in that spirit go fuck yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,i can tell you from browsing this sub that rsubredditdrama has a lot of people who could be considered neckbeards but like coming here to say well at least im not as bad as him
SubredditDrama,removed,how the fuck can you virtue signal on an anonymous forum you silly bastard
SubredditDrama,removed,this is some pretty amazing projection you sound like you jerk off while sniffing your own farts do you use lube while you prove your point
SubredditDrama,removed,my browser crashed while i was typing a response and i dont want to write it again because youre honestly kind of a wretched person the tldr is stop making sloppy arguments stop handwaving away pedophilia youre ignoring the reality of the harms of childporn because it would force you to admit that there are indeed consequences from extreme free speech that these shitty communities like rnigger rfatpeoplehate etc stop pretending like youre an emotionless robot stop pretending like you believe everyone else should just become magically and perfectly invulnerable to literally any negativity online because thats fucking ridiculous and that the real source of your logic comes from a desire to defend those shitty people not because you actually care about free speech you live in a society and have to coexist with many more people many opinions many points of view and of course many critics and even hate seriously your ingenuine nature reeks like shit and youre pretending like im not gonna shove it back up your asshole youve been extremely forcefully proclaiming that you arent going to reciprocate these exact feelings and attitudes here back to fphnazietc shitheads so its pretty fucking obvious that youre only making these arguments to defend those kinds of people the free speech zealot who actually just wants to be able to be a shithead without criticism is an unfortunately trite and common phenomenon its completely fucking obvious that total free speech is a terrible idea since it facilitates the growth of for example child porn a point which you deliberately sidestepped here nor the same guys fapping with adult women who seem like little girls acknowledging that the free speech as you describe it would cause incredibly real and obvious harm to people through pedophiliachildporn would force you to admit in general that free speech can cause harm so i can understand why you avoided it entirely i dont know maybe you really are a childporn apologist maybe not you certainly dont seem to have a problem with pedophiles but it seems like i havent burned out all of my benefit of the doubt on you quite yet
SubredditDrama,removed,i knew that was elsa immediately and also wish it had been tagged just because i think reddit normalizes incest to an unhealthy degree
SubredditDrama,removed,someone who gets so enraged by me asking to change their gloves that they want to shoot me is going to continue to struggle because they have poor anger management skills i mean shes not wrong
SubredditDrama,removed,the people who frequent rroastme are a bunch of impotently angry guys who just want to lash out out anyone more confident then themselves boggles the mind
SubredditDrama,removed,you tried uhomesickprogrammer you porki
SubredditDrama,removed,turns out roasts are only funny because comedians are funny redditors arent comedians
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess i still dont understand what grandstanding is because i see absolutely nothing wrong with acknowledging that this websites culture has been normalizing unhealthy sexual dynamics since its jailbait days
SubredditDrama,removed,rhetorical question you fishfucker
SubredditDrama,removed,she wasnt defensive even redditurds just hate women
SubredditDrama,removed,hey xaixas thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because one of your links includes personal information we need to get it removed by the rontario mods before allowing it at all here send us a modmail to discuss further if you want for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,removed,this one wasnt boring she triggered the fuck out of them with her responses lol
SubredditDrama,removed,im glad this one was different and op triggered the fuck out of them with her responses lol
SubredditDrama,removed,not tipping or possibly being a hassle to a min wage worker is one of the easiest ways to pissed the fuck out of redditors also saying pedos are scum seems to upset a large amount as well
SubredditDrama,removed,tanning or tanning lotions ton of foundation and a subtle camera filter shes prob look quite different without all that
SubredditDrama,removed,butbut eat fresh
SubredditDrama,removed,she triggered the fuck out of them with her responses lol
SubredditDrama,removed,why shouldnt i be against the world when you assholes are clearly out to get me no support for the victim me man even td cant top that victim complex
SubredditDrama,removed,youre seriously underestimating the level of dumbass we have on this planet
SubredditDrama,removed,lol im white and yeah if you post approvingly in terp subs youre a misogynist
SubredditDrama,removed,lol no srs is irrelevant and is only good for feeding your paranoia
SubredditDrama,removed,oh sure but being a terper really does make your opinion p much irrelevant
SubredditDrama,removed,whereas trp is just rational right
SubredditDrama,removed,nah i just calls it like i sees it and red pill is misogynist bullshit
SubredditDrama,removed,full retard this sub just cant control itself when it comes to trp it just shudders and shakes and freaks out whenever a topic could possibly involve feminism like total sperg out last week there was a post where a guy was downvoted for saying that a political degree was more useful for political lobbying jobs than gender studies like you cant make this shit up and theres never any shame youd think the sub would collectively wake up the next morning and be like oh shit that was bad but they never do like tomorrow theyd like ahh the of us really shouldnt have downvoted a guy for challenging the idea that trp is racist because thatsnot even close to a part of the sub but they wont
SubredditDrama,removed,god the presumption that a private company such as reddit cares beyond a lip service to free speech it is a private company
SubredditDrama,removed,wow tracking down my posts that werent even replies to you huh whos the triggered one here who
SubredditDrama,removed,kinda like how bigot kinda rhymes with faggot and it has become the goto slur from leftie degenerates
SubredditDrama,removed,what about moron srdine fallacy thats probably taken
SubredditDrama,removed,you have enough nonsense in your head already
SubredditDrama,removed,its three pages into your history mister oscar
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao they downvoted this on instinct i think the swallows of capistrano
SubredditDrama,removed,lol did not say that at all what i will say is that you are the reason its impossible to have a conversation about race in america because the second it comes up you make it personal and about strawmen fuck i even made the broadest most general statement i could white people are the source of the most important form of racism in this country and you twist it into this personal attack on your fragile ego and no being a good person isnt enough the saying all it takes for bad men to succeed is for good men to do nothing rings very true laughing at a joke where someones race or ethnicity or religion is the butt of it is complacency with racism its allowing it to exist and fester and grow unchallenged because dumb guy who makes the joke sees the laughter as agreement and it strenthens his simplistic worldview and then it gets even worse when you tell the one guy not laughing lighten up its just a joke because now mr comedian has double the reinforcement he now thinks everyone loves a good old fashioned black joke and people keep repeating it repeating it so much they start to believe this shit you can look at for example what was ironic racism has quickly become real hateful bile spewed on hell holes like pol rconspiracy rthedonald and just any old default sub but yeah people who have to tell others that they are good people always are the best people
SubredditDrama,removed,are you some sort of sjw i dont like sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,so is your silliness but we dont call this a developmentally delayed subreddit do we
SubredditDrama,removed,ellen pao was briefly hired as ceo of reddit about years ago the hire was somewhat controversial because shes a lawyer by training and not known for being a techie not a white dude
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off bud ive been out of college a long time and i went to a private engineering school so it wasnt even the fanciful strawman safe space that youre imagining uh huh and youre an absolute shut in tool if you think racism still doesnt pervade society i cant go a day without some moron making some disparaging racist remark weird im in the deep south and i can definitely go a day without some moron making some disparaging racist remark i dunno maybe over there where you are in fantasyland things are different or perhaps youre just parroting the bullshit you read in far left spaces on the internet
SubredditDrama,removed,you realize the other guy and the source of the drama is an actual tard right
SubredditDrama,removed,fine say some stupid selfflagellating shit and i will try to kick some sense into you
SubredditDrama,removed,just want to point out to you that you are a massive moron and normal people think you are a morong and i doubt you are gonna get any perspective in the far left echo chamber that is srd
SubredditDrama,removed,rworldnews not giving net upvotes to the nazi apologist a pleasant surprise
SubredditDrama,removed,so this morning i asked usoylentconor via a post in rsoylent if they could share any information about the unavailability of of the soylent products the thread quickly received upvotes and was deleted within minutes of being post a moderator then deleted several other threads that even referenced unavailability of either or coffeist after i sent modmail asking why the censorship they post a sticky and i immediately asked my question again within a minute my comment was deleted commented again deleted commented again deleted commented a fourth time and as of right now it is still up but i expeted it to be deleted too httpimgurcomaszdts here are replies from one of the moderators and httpimgurcomapfqxr this is suspect especially considering a rosa employee is a moderator of the sub edit the mod just posted the modmail to the official soylent forums update they deleted the mega thread because it had deleted comments they then repost it asdas
SubredditDrama,removed,if you really are a feminist brown dude you should have no issues with her being ultrawary of desi dudes you should be able to acknowledge the reality that desi culture is misogynistic as fuck but the fact that youre playing the victim tells me you identify more with the misogynists than the ones subjected to the misogyny it tells me you suspect you wouldnt be able to get through her filters that you may not be a feminist as you claim
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly i feel like this is an immensely terrible way of living life assuming the worst about everyone you meet yep belonging to an oppressed demographic sucks my choices are between trust automatically and get treated like shit of the time or live a hypervigilant life there are no good options this is the reality of oppression why even bother interacting with people outside your own insulated community then what are you talking about i have no choice but to interact with desi people no matter what i am a desi person doofus you think i can avoid interacting with desi relatives family friends i wish i could have an insulated community that would be a dream come true but once again this is the reality of oppression i have no easy way of escaping the oppressor i also feel like white people never get this level of scrutiny despite them being the worst oppressors but poc seem to be held to a higher standard i would have a lot more sympathy for your woes if you hadnt just shit all over desi women for speaking up about our oppression if you want us to be your allies in your effort to highlight oppression by white people you can start by showing some basic level of solidarity and uh idk stop asking desi women to shut up hmm
SubredditDrama,removed,i just dont want people to assume brown dudes are misogynistic without knowing them first all you care about is yourself being treated properly even if that means desi women get hurt hundreds of times over bravo beautiful allyship there
SubredditDrama,removed,im okay with an arranged marriage why all the white guys that pumped and dumped you didnt want to actually marry you the desi feminist circlejerk here is so hilarious nobody is stopping you from selling out your own for a piece of bone that yout white masters throw at you you dont have to invent all sorts of complex philosophy around it to justify your cowardice

SubredditDrama,removed,if reddit doesnt stick up for white people who will
SubredditDrama,removed,no im just finding it mighty hypocritical when the admins wont do anything about the rampant misogyny and racism against people who arent white floating around this shit website but the minute someone makes a threatening anti white meme they take action so fucking telling
SubredditDrama,removed,lol are you saying that inciting violence against women is fine cuz the admins didnt make it a rule even though inciting violence against women is still inciting violence or do you not think women count
SubredditDrama,removed,so you are saying we dont need to worry about people making murder memes and serious genocide and death threats against them is there anything that shouldnt be off limits against whites and this isnt

SubredditDrama,removed,agreed if i were an internet celebrity and another celebrity i never met made a light jab about the way i speak id probably be mildly selfconscious about it for a few days and probably chuckle about it a week later and id be way more concerned about the crazy white knights that felt a need to protect senpais honor im sure james rolfe being in this business for a decade and in his thirties probably had even less of a reaction than i wouldve this is whole tantrum over more female characters being included in franchises that normally involved male characters for the most part is only gonna get worse before it gets better huh

SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,its not about justifiying racism you mung its about understanding and dissecting the underlying causes its really really easy to point and laugh at people saying dey tuk er jerbs but its a lot more productive to try and understand the financial hardships and other sentiments that went into that person saying that racist thing but why of course would anyone be interested in having a nuanced conversation on srd when quietly and smugly smelling your own farts was another option
SubredditDrama,removed,cuck

SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah thats exactly why i voted out what are you stupid i couldnt care less anyway the problem was that the decision was already decided before the vote began the vote will now be used as a way to shift blame on the public for the actions of a government acting behind closed doors its fucking ludicrous ludicrous that people trust the fucking government after they have lied to us for so long
SubredditDrama,removed,this is an official warning that uhaphios is a registered sex offender please be careful when you are around him

SubredditDrama,removed,i technically posted in the thread but like generations of middle class white people im not going back as long as those people are still there
SubredditDrama,removed,buh but movies taught me buying a random girl i dont know a drink will automatically get me laid
SubredditDrama,removed,the post made it too high on rall so the oppressed white men of reddit are seeping in
SubredditDrama,removed,white americans smell like wet dog butter and deserve donald trump
SubredditDrama,removed,whatever helps you sleep at night douchebag you didnt even glance at all the evidence because you know its right
SubredditDrama,removed,youre in a bar expect to be interacted with so between this and alcohol rape we are at a point in society where the only approachable women at a bar must be sitting alone and drinking water good job millennials
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont get it its one of the dullest most overplayed ones and people go on about how great it is it even has a homophobic slur in the middle of it for some reason i know its from the but most other songs from the managed to avoid having homophobic slurs in them at least it doesnt have cliff richard in it i suppose the only ones i dont mind are that cover of mad world which people inexplicably play at christmas and some of the newer ones that havent been permanently burned into my brain yet
SubredditDrama,removed,sigh repeating the scope is irrelevant the scope is irrelevant over and over does not make the scope irrelevant no but you know what does when i argue why its irrelevant after which its incumbent on those who want to challenge my views to show why its wrong you know how to not do it being all snarky and dickheadish i swear getting you guys to argue with civility is like pulling teeth out of a shark and this is how the liberals act like now your stupid logic aside heres the crux of my argument if you are willing to accept my house my rules mentality then there is no moral difference between a house of worship and an entire country imposing equal restriction on visitors note however that the following is not being argued about the morality of policing morality now why did i call your logic stupid because your argument is essentially a country is bigger so hurr its wronger no what im arguing about has nothing to do with size it applies to iran just as well as to the vatican im going to assume youre being obstinate and am done here if your reply cant be more polite fuck off because youre done here i accept your concession
SubredditDrama,removed,no they dont thats the worst idea ever they dont deserve shit what about my ancestors who were slaves do i get money for that as well or no because my skin isnt dark enough youre a fucking idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,got a bunch of cucks in here never relaized how many sjw faggots are in this sub this is why i avoid the comments here your all a bunch of faggots who refuse to see the world for what it is a bunch of special snowflakes here go kill yourself no one likes any of you except for your own delusional friends go back to your echo chamber of shit ideas rshitredditsays needs you
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah but i didnt directly do anything to hurt black people i only benefited from a system in which they were systematically kept from effectively competing for my jobs or educational opportunities why dont they just pull themselves up by their bootstraps like i did i used my inheritance to continue my fathers business after he paid for my college people should just do that
SubredditDrama,removed,nice stale memes idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,not really there are only like guys who have the toys displayed generally everyone else is quite normal and pleasant to work with i see i have offended some people i tend to forget that when women show their opinions on reddit its generally an instant downvote should have just posted that cheetos covered fingers bad breath and pit stains along with children toys turn me on
SubredditDrama,removed,altright is the nigger of the world
SubredditDrama,removed,a milf is a woman old enough to be your mother that you want to fuck typically a woman in her to with the presumption that you are like stiflers mom or stacys mom or mrs robinson i cant believe how many fucking autistics are in that thread that just dont get this
SubredditDrama,removed,these are the same fucking nimrods who insist charlize theron is an africanamerican i seriously want to grab a gun every time i have to talk to these braindead fucks
SubredditDrama,removed,silly neckbeard her life wont be easy because she is pretty it will be easy because she is white
SubredditDrama,removed,if you read upvtsherlockobviouss comment the one i originally replied to youd see they actually werent looking for porn search terms sure that works when youre talking about porn genres but what about more generally
SubredditDrama,removed,you sir are a fucking idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,cant argue with fact and evidence free arguments like that heres a suggestion why dont you eat shit and die you ignorant racist fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,thats either a troll or a legitimately autistic racist the whole thread makes no sense otherwise
SubredditDrama,removed,im not the one degrading an entire race of people by incorrectly labeling them the term africanamerican was invented by africanamericans and replaced the term negro at their request it is a label they chose for themselves i am not degrading africanamericans by referring to them by the terminology they have requested they be referred to by you clearly are ignorant of the history of the term and do not care that africanamericans have requested you use the term which indicates that you think your own ignorant opinions about what the term means matter more than the opinions of the people the term actually refers to that is racist it does not imply that all black people are from africa because the term only refers to americans descended from african slaves and black african immigrants to america referring to nonafrican blacks or nonblack africans as africanamericans would be wrong you literally have no idea what you are talking about are arguing from a position of complete ignorance and are an offensive ignorant doofus
SubredditDrama,removed,if we play this right we could have a new jewdank to mess with
SubredditDrama,removed,tell me how i should label myself to please you douchebag shitstain fucktard asshat
SubredditDrama,removed,right i seriously cant believe im still arguing with that autist i just now noticed this got linked here notsuprised though its funny by scope what gets considered drama for rcalvinandhobbs p
SubredditDrama,removed,someone whos not employing you cant fire or demote you so thats not relevant its absolutely relevant someone who wants to be president but takes extraordinary measures to avoid us transparency laws is not qualified to do so if you think the fbi doesnt act differently towards a former secretary of stateprobable presidential candidate than they would anyone with a lower rank youre a fool
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont give a shit about your ego even if i get downvoted to oblivion for it i believe it is important to provide a counterpoint to your lies about her actions
SubredditDrama,removed,soros is pumping millions into protests where could i get a hold of these soros bucks
SubredditDrama,removed,soros
SubredditDrama,removed,i get that pcmr is kinda acting over the top but also fuck that guy
SubredditDrama,removed,whats with all the fuckwit opinions in this thread did derdrumpf find it or something seriously dude what exactly are you expecting from reddit at this point its a shitshow this subreddit is not exempt from the qualities of reddit that dip every worthwhile discussion in shit
SubredditDrama,removed,the sub or the content on this sub big difference you might want to clear up
SubredditDrama,removed,ben my audience is so dumb i have to label everything garrison
SubredditDrama,removed,alt right and sjws are just two sides of the same retarded coin
SubredditDrama,removed,ben one man klan garrison
SubredditDrama,removed,no no no you idiots srd party line is that theyre crypto fascists dont point out that these people are actually moderate democrats and most people cant stand srds whiny politics
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont fucking want to attack you nor am i trying stop it and while i would never call myself a nazi and dont consider myself one you and everyone of your peers here would absolutely call me one and therefore advocate for violence against me the level of moral superiority im observing here in srd when it comes to justify acts of random violence and aggression towards people like me is quite something for fucks sake at least just be honest and stop being such vile hypocrites
SubredditDrama,removed,im confused i was constantly told that trump was playing all of us and there would be no wall or immigrant ban down amazing weeks to go
SubredditDrama,removed,for fuck sake stop calling richard spencer a fucking nazi you ignorant fucks dont even know that spencer has been criticized for a while now in the altright for being too soft and a chuck and too liberaltolerant also thats a fucking lie simple as that why dont youand the your deluded confused peers herehear from the mans mouth before spreading bullshit httpssoundcloudcomaltrightthereturnofpolitical
SubredditDrama,removed,caring about national politics is a waste of time if they dont agree with my views
SubredditDrama,removed,kill yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,disgusting i hope his mother is tortured and raped in front of him
SubredditDrama,removed,there is statistical evidence that supports this and to deny it would be to deny pure science this post runs through with research and evidence backing it up of course sjws will ignore facts because they dont line up with their narrative
SubredditDrama,removed,a lot of popular media including most news networks and hollywood basically the few places hiillary dominated will call anyone with a differeing opinion alt right or even nazi or fascist jontron is a goofy comedy youtuber of some sort sargon of akkad is a british guy who also does youtube videos but is not that kind of far left guy who wants socialism and identity politics that actually cause more strife and shift focus away from treating people as if skin color or gender wouldnt matter hes not even a big fan of trump but when people come out and call trump a nazi sargon feels obligated to blow down the regressive leftists house of cards that was built on an already wobbly table much butthurt commences people call sargon and trump fascists nazis racists sexists etc alt right far right wing politics jontron with a politically neutral channel guests on a livestream of sargons and reveals some non extrem views regressive leftists go ballistic and pidgeon hole jontron as a fascist nazi racist sexist etc etc this is how the leftliberaldemocratic party or at least large segments of it deal with people they merely dislike or disagree with when you ask for examples to back up assertions they point to jokes or grasp at straws and misinformation as well as having common practices such as changing definitions of words as well as playing psych games game theory if you call someone fascistor racist sexist etc long enough as they did during the inaguration protests and destroy physical property youll get police called down on your ass and get arrested they then scream come and see the violence inherent in the system this will in turn psyche up your comrades even more and they in turn get more violent its not too long before youve convinced people that violent acts on the alleged fascists is perfectly acceptible the movement then only has to make accusation and that accused party suffers consequences that is what social justicebecause the actual ideal of justice doesnt need a qualifier social justice is not about justice but mob rule does to the minds of these zealotic regressive leftists and was plainly evident not only among the anarchists at the inauguration but the normally dressed protestors that cheered them on its funny because you can see this all evidenced even chronicled in raw footage because half the people at the inauguration were using cameras and were more than happy to post the videos up and around yet the regressive leftists will gather and bandwaggon here with updownvotes that malign their ideology as if video evidence counts for nothing to think so is part of the white mans patriarchy that we live in his colonial science that we should tear down and start over with say witchcraft if that sounds scary and fucked up its because reality is often stranger than fiction oh wait weve already had such things in fiction one was called lord of the flies as well as where accusation was enough and evidence could be overlooked for whatever narative was on todays agenda let the downvotes flood from the delusional left go nuts destroy my stock of fake internet points truth is a lot of the people against the vocal and delusional left were formerly quite liberal populated by a very diverse group of people who all agree on the specifics i can give you examples of not only white males but females trans and people of all ethnic backgrounds who actually you know get along in harmony because they actually do not care about such things but rather judge people by their words and actions and are pretty much peaceful against all forms of violencewhich as of late has pretty much exclusively come from regressive leftists and anarchists unless youre looking at some of the fake hate crimes that were supposedly commited by trump supporters instances where people painted racist shit on their own property and set it on fire and were caught outright lies about physical abuse towards muslims and the sort a highly popular fake crime basically the religious right in decades past the staunch christians and whatnot lost religion but are still fucked in the head and running rampant on the left ditched religion along with all sense of ethics and critical thinking ability okto you few rational and informed people who may read this what did i miss
SubredditDrama,removed,the altright is made up of racists and bigots who get real butthurt when you point out that their opinions are shitty easiest way to boil it down is that jontron is siding with the guys who always volunteer to be devils advocate when it comes to hitler
SubredditDrama,removed,right except thats not what the majority of the people throwing around the term mean its like how a faggot used to mean a bundle of wood thats not what it means nowadays and dont get me wrong that kind of behavior is unacceptable regardless of your political stance but ive never seen someone who believes that shit become president so forgive me if its less of a concern of mine compared to the altrighters
SubredditDrama,removed,got better than the outright lies unindzya posted no that was never true i had a period where i didnt feel great and yes that passed
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,haha i dont really care to be honest saying grabbing someone is battery and assault is what i find funny
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly im not really to bothered its the people that are making it out like he actually did assault someone which he didnt im just bored to be honest and like to troll so the more people get worked up about it the longer im going to keep it up
SubredditDrama,removed,its either could have or couldve but never could of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
SubredditDrama,removed,well it is when you can check them to see if it is yours its not like it was some shitty bike that everyone had it was expensive and not many people had them
SubredditDrama,removed,is that what youre going to say in court when you get arrested for assault some day
SubredditDrama,removed,exactly and nobody did call the police because he didnt actually hurt anyone hahaha this whole fucking thread is beyond retarded its actually giving me cancer just replying you commented on something else but this still applies to you say what you like i know he isnt so idgaf
SubredditDrama,removed,whats removed and calling me a psychopath isnt a personal attack wtf one rule for them and another for me get fucked
SubredditDrama,removed,im not banned you fucking mug i can only comment every minutes and since i can only comment once for the next minutes ill tag people that are replying while i wait to send this reply unancyballosky its a good job i dont live in the mo fuckin ghetto then aint it udrunkycrowette the fact you carry mace just proves my point youre all to fucking soft for your own good i hope someone does one day and youre to busy trying to get your pathetic mace out to defend yourself and you end up in hospital not being able to speak living in a bubble
SubredditDrama,removed,personally i love telling people to kill themselves sometimes its the only way to get the point across
SubredditDrama,removed,pathetic your boyfriend said you could have a taser lol the fact you have to get permission says it all cya hope you find a decent person to fill you with cum or maybe your gay but hey im not gonna make that assumption would explain the mace hahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,violence is never the answer gross and creepy tbh
SubredditDrama,removed,haha wut safer from what living outside of your little bubble youre exactly the type of person that is all over this sub and in the other thread you have no idea about what actually goes on outside of your little life good stuff try not to kill yourself seems like youre the kind of person that likes to commit when stuff gets a bit hard uthedeadmanwalks i am well thank you very much just bored and you guys are fun
SubredditDrama,removed,hahaha im hardly crazy i didnt do shit im just having fun at everyone crying at shit that happened years ago and wished you a horrible death because you wont assault people what are you talking about you came in this thread talking shit but cant take it fuck yourself should probably delete your post history aswell found out much more than idve liked
SubredditDrama,removed,yep wouldve been a lot easier for them to practice on a userbase that has the efficacy of a wet noodle
SubredditDrama,removed,go fuck yourself you guys ruined a perfectly useful tool that a bunch of people were happily using for no other reason than to be dickheads
SubredditDrama,removed,how is it racist most muslims are brown people you dont hear him attacking groups that are predominantly white flawless logic i guess the bbbut muh christianity is just as bad crowd is really just people looking for an excuse to attack white people
SubredditDrama,removed,can we not bring up td in every fucking post
SubredditDrama,removed,dude posts to reurope rcanadapolitics and rthedonald hmmmm
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah no the message there is a load of bs its still doing the shit they were doing throughout blaming their problem on something else unfortunately we mishandled some public relations issues they kept calling the whole debacle a pr issue one comment was you have our whole pr department laughing at how much of a shitstorm this is or something it was not a pr issue it was not a one time breach they repeatedly and unabashedly abused personal user information to repeatedly personally contact individuals who had used their platform at times using information that hadnt even been put on the platform whats more its not all the innocent people there were just guys erik and nikita and a bunch of money someone some idiots trusted them with
SubredditDrama,removed,or
SubredditDrama,removed,i honestly didnt know that wasnt allowed if i knew i would have cropped the name out i left the name in to show the mods i was actually getting off twitter spaghetti your an aussie too how many you reckon would know the difference between nigger and nigga rhetorical question
SubredditDrama,removed,its already public you cannot have a company with an anonymous ceo in the usa carrotcom says theyre owned by five industries inc on their website which is a legitimate company like any other in the usa and it happens to have a guy named nikita bier as its ceo aind founder that is public knowledge you cannot by law have a company in the usa where the ceo or founder is anonymous
SubredditDrama,removed,i have no idea what thats supposed to show but id like sources on the claims that they were trying to take over subs manipulating votes honestly i think you just skimmed over some of the incendiary bits without actually reading anything that well or maybe youre a histrionic moron who knows
SubredditDrama,removed,elfa is an alcoholic girl and i hate her
SubredditDrama,removed,of note the project politify points to the fact that ucalbearia still has at least httpswwwredditcomuserpolitify albeit one not used recently as others have indicated though ucalbeariax so yeah

SubredditDrama,removed,very nice video with very talented dancing hopefully islam is one day eradicated from the face of the earth and things like this can happen in previously muslim parts of the world that will never happen of course but a man can dream as for the drama all i see is the usual religion of peace circle jerk with lots of moral posturing pretty bland all things considered
SubredditDrama,removed,i feel like there needs to be some sort of brigading effort where we post pictures of donald duck to rthedonald
SubredditDrama,removed,what exactly does very little mean to you do you realize how dangerous a crackhead whos shown extreme willingness to use violence and has zero care for getting better is please tell me what the fuck exactly would someone have to do for you to consider it to do more than very little good with them in prison also how does him being in prison harm his family and the community this is the same family that seems terrified of him and the same community that he violently robbed people i mean did you read a single word from uikkinn serious question here i fail to see how his family is being harmed by him being in prison

SubredditDrama,removed,how about they ban people who fuck children how about we start with the line there and then see where else it should be you goddamn psycho
SubredditDrama,removed,thats my point the legality of it is not the issue if there are laws that let him do what he did those are bad laws lying about your age to fuck teenagers is repulsive behavior that should be punished i dont care about the legality so your oh so clever weed argument doesnt hold water also yeah youre a pedo and a psycho

SubredditDrama,removed,to be fair leftists such as myself arent the only ones who insert politics into everything in srd pretty much every srd thread even remotely political has a handful of right wingers from drama being contary up and down the thread can i condemn them for being political not really i get political on reddit the whole time its just venting really srd is a place where right wingers centrists liberals and leftists all coexist and are kept in check by the benevolent dictatorship of the mods
SubredditDrama,removed,how about crime rate statistics is someone justified in feeling spiteful towards certain races based on those numbers
SubredditDrama,removed,so uredwoodser never harassed ujustdrop with racial epithets bull fucking shit you facetious fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,commies
SubredditDrama,removed,the vegan dude does it yeah and he says as much if you ask not much trouble to make him admit
SubredditDrama,removed,i love debating politics but i only do it on a few subs like this one i know there is someone called unwordable weirdness sp who follows people around to argue about veganism or some shit which is strange to me
SubredditDrama,removed,oh i could see that ive run into those types a few times elsewhere and wait what bestiality really
SubredditDrama,removed,wew lad i say lets agree to disagree and you give talking points a fighter wouldve said ok sounds good but you went with autistic screeching i think maybe i was wrong youre not a fighter youre just insufferable youre assuming ive even read piaget and judging me on terms ive never even heard in context of him fuck off you pretentious twat cant wait to vote trump in
SubredditDrama,removed,which is especially concerning since fascist literally means to them anyone that disagrees with me
SubredditDrama,removed,i sense you have actual autism
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean im certainly not a communist but is it really so bad to think that nazis should be punched im generally against violence as a response to speech but when you have people literally advocating for the genocide of millions of people is a punch in the face really that unwarranted
SubredditDrama,removed,you dont need to be a communist for that though im all for free market capitalism and realize that some of the worst crimes in human history have happened under the guise of communism and i still dont feel bad for any nazi getting punched in the face on the other hand i feel the same way about the black bloc so theres that
SubredditDrama,removed,mentions he is going to red pill someone calls people cucks uses thedonald as a source guys i got reddit bingo
SubredditDrama,removed,ah i remember that username catholicextremist used to argue about abortion here a while back went full trump apprently
SubredditDrama,removed,fortunately the foundation of conservative does not rest on the notion of mass deportations i would argue its frankly a radical idea that has no place in conservatism wrong minorities vote overwhelmingly liberal whites overwhelmingly conservative if you ever want another conservative elected ever again then you need to deport the illegals god the dog whistles pitch just gets lower and lower
SubredditDrama,removed,hey arent you that creepy dude whose gf posted to rrelationships to understand why her roommate was upset that the two of you were fucking in the room while she was awake have you guys learned basic decency yet
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you autist

SubredditDrama,removed,reddit where removing the foreskin is akin to removing your own arms
SubredditDrama,removed,theres a sharp difference between the customers dumb opinions should be humored and the customers terrible behavior should be tolerated which the possible definite thedonald poster is ignoring
SubredditDrama,removed,lol you showed his ass and he has yet to respond must be nice to live in a bubble
SubredditDrama,removed,our nukes are for the cockroach eating ching chongs the cousin fucking pakistanis are just a fly which occasionally irritates you before you smak it down
SubredditDrama,removed,pakistan needs to be nuked from the face of earth not even kidding all military men should be executed all government officials liquidated all civilians should be put in forced de radiclization camps until they remotely semble humans all chidren should be permanently taken from their families and raised in specially built children shetler to ensure that the terrorism cuture of their parents dont pass onto them
SubredditDrama,removed,everyones entitled to a legal defense by everyone you mean white americans right
SubredditDrama,removed,ugh i hate the laws of thermonuclear dynamics people in these types of discussions the human body is not some magical machine that is efficient it takes more calories to digest some foods than others some of the food will never be completely digested and youll poop out the calories if you eat calories of white bread you get more calories than if you eat calories of whole grain bread but i also hate that most people on both sides of the issue acknowledge that people eat food for the flavor sure we could all be eating nothing but rice and beans and oatmeal but we sure do like our pizza and cheeseburgers poor people arent any different yeah oatmeal is cheap but so are marshmallow mateys yeah rice and beans is cheap but so are hot dogs and ramen and you dont have to buy herbs and spices to make them tasty ive been super poor and now im solidly middle class i eat healthier now because i can afford to try out six different recipes for chickpea curry until i find one i really like on the other hand i remember being poor as shit and buying a mango for the first time it was gross i couldnt afford to buy another mango to see if the first one i got was unripe or overripe or just a variety i dont care for thats the reality of being poor you eat what is cheap easy and you know you and your family if you have one will eat it
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,look at the difference in treatment when this happened i saw nothing but a outpouring of sympathy from both white and black people i saw a lot of black people using this to make it clear those black people torturing a white guy was or how important it is that or the classic httpchicagosuntimescomnewsmitchellwhenisahatecrimeahatecrime
SubredditDrama,removed,its true no white cishet male victim should receive any help until every minority victim gets theirs i celebrate this further divide you are fostering

SubredditDrama,removed,first time i see rdrama rejecting an autist
SubredditDrama,removed,we really need a psa and campaign about acceptable alternatives to faggot so people can stay current with the fashionable insults any year old catty girls here to deliver the burns du jour
SubredditDrama,removed,professional victims on my trollx no way this is the same sub that body shames men while clicking their tongues about how horrible it is when men do it women the same sub that seriously whines about mansplaining but gets mad if someone mentions womansplaining
SubredditDrama,removed,suicide squad getting bad reviews those fucking pretentious critics taking this movie to seriously omg ghostbusters getting good reviews its those fucking esjaydubus i swear muh feminism is bad

SubredditDrama,removed,ikr when did srd become so smugly rightwing was it when it got brigaded by the reactionaries of rdrama when got banned
SubredditDrama,removed,youre right theyre not posting on reddit because its full of philistines such as yourself and is intended for english speakers
SubredditDrama,removed,police shootings you know the subject of blacklivesmatter httpswwwwashingtonpostcomgraphicsnationalpoliceshootings black women killed by police white men killed by police
SubredditDrama,removed,this thread is depressing i actually find this girl to be pretty beautiful reddit if youre not a youre an uggo
SubredditDrama,removed,of course the guy fat shaming is upvoted of course
SubredditDrama,removed,white people are of population black people are so normalized figures are black women white men wow that changes everything oh wait no black women are still less likely to be killed than white men by an order of magnitude
SubredditDrama,removed,aggregate data from several decades if you want to use old data to prove that black women used to have it worse go ahead im just proving that right now black women are less likely to be killed by police than white men per capita values httpsenwikipediaorgwikidemographyoftheunitedstatesraceandethnicity so normalized figures are black women killed by police white men killed by police wow that changes everything oh wait no black women are still less likely to be killed than white men by an order of magnitude
SubredditDrama,removed,how is it a racist tirade to say that when it comes to getting shot by police your gender matters more than your race men even white men are more likely to be shot than women even black women the numbers are clear as crystal httpsenwikipediaorgwikidemographyoftheunitedstatesraceandethnicity so normalized figures are black women killed by police white men killed by police wow that changes everything oh wait no black women are still less likely to be killed than white men by an order of magnitude maybe you just dont understand statistics or already have a chip on your shoulder
SubredditDrama,removed,but women are the group least at risk from police shootings if alllivesmatter is a stupid and racist movement for not focusing on the most at risk group then sayhername is an even more stupid and racist movement
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao so apparently im banned from this sub on that account i dont know or care why so fuck em hope some of you get some entertainment from this just to explain my logic i couldnt care less what they or you lot think of me fact of the matter is what i actually said to the guy was correct and all the people calling me condescending can go fuck themselves because literally who cares what they think theyre defending a guy who ive proven was objectively wrong to make the statement that he did bring on the downvotes see you guys next time i get linked here is there a medal for reaching times i think this is my
SubredditDrama,removed,would you at all view this in the same way as discrimination towards women in the work force of the where they had to work harder to be viewed the same as an average man what would you say to claims that its fair for them to assume you are dangerous because black people do statistically comit more crime
SubredditDrama,removed,have fun pretending to care about men you durian oh wait you quit menslib you no longer have to pretend that must be a weight off your mind
SubredditDrama,removed,sounds like is a homophone homophobe
SubredditDrama,removed,im an elementary music teacher who has used both dc and rg in the past both have their advantages and disadvantages i am in an extremely high poverty area so dc works ok for me and i am also only in my year teaching year at this school so rg has been great for me every year as well since i often need a lot of random little things for my classroom anyway if anyone wants to help here are links to my amazon wishlist and my donors choose project
SubredditDrama,removed,i think if people hit the context button and looked at the post i was responding to it would be a lot more obvious that i was just trying to make fun of that person when he was saying stuff like one wellfleshed out report and hed lose his current twitter as well i mean i tried my best to make sure it didnt seem to serious saying that i had a twitter admin account that i would ban his stocks and that cuba doesnt have any beehives im also pretty sure that uneodestiny was for the most part in on it i think he was only responding on the offchance that i actually wasnt kidding
SubredditDrama,removed,pretty much redditexe
SubredditDrama,removed,dae all socialists are hyperaggressive angry idiots who expect everyone to know every obscure doctrinal point of their moldy ideologies like i dont support capitalism
SubredditDrama,removed,i genuinely love how there are already people linking rushton pdfs talking about the intellectual inferiority of blacks and yet they hide behind the just asking questions bullshit and the rest of the comments are either bitching about how social sciences is all about feelings and sjws the fragility of the reddit logical user base is so goddamn funny to see
SubredditDrama,removed,i genuinely love how there are already people linking rushton pdfs talking about the intellectual inferiority of blacks and yet they hide behind the just asking questions bullshit and the rest of the comments are either bitching about how social sciences is all about feelings and sjws countdown to eruption of mt dramaticus tomorrow edit i cant wait for oxus to remove this comment as circlebroke
SubredditDrama,removed,someone on reddit literally told me that being conservative is the new coolhip thing to do
SubredditDrama,removed,my favourite thing about rworldnews aside from the racism espoused by those who are among the first to damn others for the same offense is the consistency with a title like that you know exactly what youre going to get in the comments
SubredditDrama,removed,in the eyes of practically all stats concerning it its true too but dont let me get in the way of your oppression narrative
SubredditDrama,removed,haha he gouges people for medications so funny
SubredditDrama,removed,ok brb im gonna raise my kid my way the old way by fucking him real hard in the ass hope youre ok with it
SubredditDrama,removed,the problem is i dont see a way to watch it without seeing the sjw aspects it would be like trying to watch my little pony after only knowing it through posts by the crazy bronies
SubredditDrama,removed,because reddit is mostly kids who havent grown any empathy yet
SubredditDrama,removed,yes someone evil and hateful that doesnt deserve such livelihood in the first place bending over and taking it doesnt make you a bigger person it makes you a chump and a victim cool so now violence is okay if its against someone i perceive to be hateful even if they werent violent themselves glad we cleared all that up
SubredditDrama,removed,the stem crowd is always hands down one of the most uncritical and least intelligent factions on the entire site talking to them is like arguing with a brick wall even the explicitly racistbigoted people are actually articulate and well read in their own rightwing propaganda these guys cant even do that they just swallow whatever sounds most sciencey and contains all the right cultural signifiers of smartness even if it is completely wrong the result is that people with agendas can freely spread dangerous mass misinformation this is why i think we need to resurrect to some extent premodern notions of esotericsm in academic culture in opposition to the constant annoyingly moralistic calls for transparency and openness some knowledge really is extremely dangerous and misleading to the uninitiated
SubredditDrama,removed,no the argument of if you cant afford to live in a city then dont live there is a valid argument whatever the fuck youre saying is not a valid argument
SubredditDrama,removed,well i suppose this is as good a time as any to post this gem i found on the tv tropes special snowflake syndrome discussion page special snowflake is such a fuckdamn annoyingly condescending little phrase its bandied about no less than nostalgia badwrongfun and other such date rapists of open discussion the phrase implies that everyone and everything are common and exactly the same as eachother — much like snowflakes — therefore anyone or anything that attempts to be unique different or special is foolhardy that is a shitty attitude just what in the fuck is wrong with wanting to be unique different or special do you asswipes want everything everywhere to be exactly the fucking same should all tabletop game experiences follow the same railroaded script should we all watch the exact same movies play the same video games and read the same novels indulging in exactly the same forms of entertainment must all earthly cultures be no different than one another shall we decide that all human beings that arent the right skin color be purged for fear of not being normal thats right fuck you i said it if you hate special snowflakes you are fucking racist kill yourself should the planet earth be coated in a uniform layer of cement so every inch of the globe is no different not a special snowflake from all others this is what you dumbasses are implying everytime you utter that hateful phrase you are standing proud of being the exact same height as those around you of being cookiecutter copies with nothing to differentiate you from those around you you mustnt be a special snowflake you must conform confooorm confooooorm difference and uniqueness is bad fuck you i will be a special snowflake im going my own way walking my own paths i will be free and i bet thats exactly what you boring normal fucks are afraid of isnt it well good look upon this special snowflake and despair for i have achieved what you and your lookalike fellows darent dream go ahead and sling all your prefabricated catch phrases about immaturity childishness ur meeeaaan aka attacking the tone◊ and stupid grunts and tuttuts by the way that makes you sound like a retard that reign in your fellow mindless plebian farm animals they are but water droplets falling from the umbrellas rim hey i like that analogy the rest of you and your bullshit is just so much falling rain that would sully my clothes were it not for my metaphoric umbrella to keep you twats away but i di gah i so hate that pretentious phrase but digressing i am so whatever and by the way why in the world would you inane shits ever think id want to be like you sounds like a stagnant bore to me this snowflake shall stay special thank you very much do yourself a favor and read a history book sometime there have been lots of people throughout time that hated special snowflakes to the point of campaigns of genocide where are they now dead buried their intolerance and racism stomped into submission by the special snowflakes they hoped to exterminate for no other reason than those snowflakes were not like every other keep that in mind next time you try and correct someone for wandering from the one true way its okay but to an extent like everyone above are saying just who the fuck are you to decide what is and isnt too far who the fuck are you to decide where the line is drawn or that there is even a line in the first place is this what you say to gay people its okay to like other men but dont you dare wear pink clothes you homo reminds me of that south park episode where cartmans talking to token people like seeing black people on tv seeing black people not hearing them inconsistency and moral relativity are such wonderful concepts
SubredditDrama,removed,my favorite reddit double standard i dont find black people attractive thats cool brah its just personal preference i dont find this particular white person attractive dude wtf neckbeard much she is a goddess and you would be lucky for her to spit on you
SubredditDrama,removed,by a guy who only had the vaguest idea of what the speech was about and was advised by four very partisan advisers
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,im mocking you for being a cunt because youre being a count id bet money youre under
SubredditDrama,removed,yes lets coddle islam and muslims forever and ever
SubredditDrama,removed,a peaceful religion lol wtf keep drinking the cool aid u goddamn westerner
SubredditDrama,removed,men and non cis lesbians so men and men cute redundancy men cant be lesbians also the mod created gendercynical a hate sub against gender critical feminists they have worked actively to let men take over conversations and ban women who are not on board with the idea of transwomen taking over the sub so the idea that al is some radical feminist haven is absurd as fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,or lesbian women deserve to have their voices heard and were tired of gay men and men who identify as women getting more speaking time then us how dare women stand up for themselves right
SubredditDrama,removed,would be terrible if some of their muslim temples got burned down like the one with the loudspeaker but hey go and defend them despite the fact that muslims hate trannies gays and women seriously be proud defending a group which not only despises others but actively kills them what a smart decision
SubredditDrama,removed,silence white boi
SubredditDrama,removed,you live with no external manifestation of your own beliefs hopes dreams or desires you live according to my laws my rules and my wishes like a worthless slave you have been deprived of what makes you a human each night you go to sleep with your life property and men being at our mercy belonging to us by law and each morning you wake up knowing your father will dress the way i tell him to your brother will behave as i instruct him and your husband will do what pleases me
SubredditDrama,removed,i found a place where you can download a leaked copy enjoy

SubredditDrama,removed,woah man youre pretty fucking tumblr i hate this fucking website
SubredditDrama,removed,statistically theres a good chance not honestly this is getting into some rather mraish territory and id prefer not to go there i believe the vast majority of rape victims arent lying or exaggerating of course its possible she is and if so then of course i will agree that she is an awful person for doing it
SubredditDrama,removed,dont be an intentionally ignorant pedantic douchebag
SubredditDrama,removed,cant see where youre walking properly when your tits are in the way
SubredditDrama,removed,so does this officially make rthedonald the gayest sub on reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,ive already explained at least twice why it isnt the same issue idk if i need to use smaller words or something so youll get it or youre just really determined to make the conversation about racism in the beauty industry about white women but either way im done
SubredditDrama,removed,but what youre telling me is that im not allowed to care about my makeup issues and yours that i can only care about yours how fucking selfcentered are you did you go to school to learn how to not read because damn i never said dont care about your problems only mine just dont fucking compare yours to a product of industry wide racism and try to take over conversations about this you think youre commiserating about an annoyance but all youre doing is making woc issue about white people and making it harder to talk about our issues whats the point of speaking up about colorism when its just going to turn into another conversation about pale people
SubredditDrama,removed,but youre in here screaming that your lack of options is the only issue that exists no just that the problems while seeming similar have different roots and therefore are different conversations and that derailing topics about racism in the beauty industry to make it about pale problems is extremely shitty and takes away focus from the problem at hand also i thought you said you were done with us no i was done with that specific loser youre a whole new dumb bitch that im done with now
SubredditDrama,removed,i wasnt in the mua thread lol i barely post there actually and if you knew how to fucking read youd have already known that but im guessing you wore a helmet to school so i get why you didnt
SubredditDrama,removed,if you go through ucellis post history youll see that hes scrawny as hell which makes it ironic that hes hating on fatties for being lazy
SubredditDrama,removed,its a womens vanity subreddit i dont know why anyone would expect a hugbox
SubredditDrama,removed,an interesting perspective httpwwwpointsincasecomarticlesindefenseofmansplaining
SubredditDrama,removed,if uvoltairinede and the other elites really are maoists that would explain a lot about ranarchism
SubredditDrama,removed,so this confirms that uravencrowed and uprincekropotkin were keeping that sub alive
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,just being at that weight is risky in general
SubredditDrama,removed,eyyyy kinda off topic but if youd like to incite responses akin to the reddit shit storm i started except in real life then i have a store on zazzle selling my sticker responsible for said eriot and many more hit me up for more details
SubredditDrama,removed,the concept of racial bloodlines while not true are still acted upon as if they were real what the hell of course theyre real how would commercial dna services like or ancestrycom be able to tell you where your ancestors came from if reproductively isolated populations ie races werent real for a visual aid a chart of genetic distance that samples individuals drawn from various populations source notice how people from the same populations tend to cluster together
SubredditDrama,removed,wait am i in bizarro land you people support this and think felons shouldnt have to reveal that they are felons on a job application wtf its not racist to not want to hire felons people wow how delusional can you get
SubredditDrama,removed,meh its totally possible

SubredditDrama,removed,of all the this gs i dont get about reddit its ummmm love of incest is one of them why besides the medicallegal reasons not to do it why limit yourself the world is a buffet fucking sample it literally
SubredditDrama,removed,some people just think webbed fingers and toes in children are desirable traits who are we as society to stop them
SubredditDrama,removed,if theres one thing reddit hates its kids being happy
SubredditDrama,removed,that puppy looks delicious
SubredditDrama,removed,never take advice from reddit i learned that today ill update as soon as things calm down here l o l
SubredditDrama,removed,today on srd were gonna talk about e u g e n i c s
SubredditDrama,removed,um they are half brother and half sister lol are you fucking joking youre disgusting
SubredditDrama,removed,you could apply that to any risky thing ever though
SubredditDrama,removed,i love how painfully obvious it is that youre using the exact same argument and mentality against gay marriage you dont understand it and have never been in a scenario that youre even relevant to the topic but you feel as if youre some sort of oracle as to what is right and wrong lol just saying something is immoral or gross because you think so doesnt make it true as a bum once said thats like your opinion man
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean what im reading is that you cant actually explain why
SubredditDrama,removed,abortion is a thing though

SubredditDrama,removed,twelve hours late but welp here goes the biggest problem with rtwoxchromosomes is that they take feminism and the righteousness to another level not every time is this troublesome but as we saw in the aforementioned post it cause quite the trouble the people over at twox are i dare say more concerned on how oppression is affecting the couple rather than focusing on the problem at hand this i dont want anyone being oppressed by society attitude is what triggered the weird comment reply maybe incest is okay for some but op explicitly stated she is not okay with incest yet many replies state on how she should be okay with it to counter societys oppressive nature against incest weird i say but the online world never ever mirrors the real world always take advice online with five pinches of salt
SubredditDrama,removed,i think that the original post is a bit of a stretch but pizzagate has shown that the democratic party is and was founded on the normalization of pedophilia i dont think the simpsons knew about it theyre not a part of the government in any capacity but you simultaneously cannot vote for the democratic party and be antipedophila
SubredditDrama,removed,the trend in every country goes from an absolutely miserable bottom to slightly better or much better conditions lol
SubredditDrama,removed,pissing in the popcorn and directly linking the sub wow
SubredditDrama,removed,kys right direction quit pretending like you let us all learn that op is a faggot and that ppl lie on the internet you just suck
SubredditDrama,removed,gotta put the feeeemales in their place theyre stealing the spotlight from important issues like ethics in gaming journalism
SubredditDrama,removed,would you walk through a bad neighborhood in chicago waving bills around
SubredditDrama,removed,nah
SubredditDrama,removed,you are being extremely disingenuous if you fear being raped or assaulted on a daily basis that is a problem with you and your mentality not with society with how low the rates of rape and assault are in its also an extremely sad existence to walk around perpetually looking over your shoulder when you are statistically unlikely to ever be victimized
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah if some dumb pretentious neckbeard just kept blathering again and again about how my house was on fire despite me already knowing that and he refused to get water or get help or offer a place to stay or do anything actually useful whatsoever that would indeed be astoundingly lazy and nihilistic of him
SubredditDrama,removed,nah
SubredditDrama,removed,im sorry you feel that way
SubredditDrama,removed,thats a bogus statistic even if that were true thats a in chance to be raped on any given day better just never leave your house with that attitude
SubredditDrama,removed,but its true even if it is shitty to say the would you rather be raped or murdered question is dumb anyway you can always potentially recover from rape never from murder thinking rape is worse is irrational
SubredditDrama,removed,yes media outlet are wrong when they selectively report stories and report stories with a clear slant and agenda while presenting themselves as neutral whether thats fox or cnn this is not a difficult concept to grasp
SubredditDrama,removed,what are you even talking about
SubredditDrama,removed,yea youre right dog just stay at home or go outside and always be fearful im glad that you are teaching people to be irrationally afraid definitely a real empowering message you got there
SubredditDrama,removed,just because humans are irrational doesnt mean we shouldnt point out irrational thoughtbehavior and work to change from within not a valid defense for an argument either
SubredditDrama,removed,and yet neither of you can actually answer the problem because literally nobody knows a single field hockey player because nobody gives a fuck about field hockey but you will make fun from afar in your safe space without having any actual added information what a load of shit you are a fucking pussy
SubredditDrama,removed,so you concede you cant respond
SubredditDrama,removed,you link an ice hockey goalie fucking bryzgalov you are unaware of the irony why dont you link to a funny moment from a field hockey goalie bryz my god the lack of awareness too good
SubredditDrama,removed,full retard
SubredditDrama,removed,field hockey is played in a few more countries around to because all you need is a stick and a ball but you still will fucking not even try to answer who are the internationally known superstars of field hockey gretzky is widely considered the greatest sportsman ever is there a single field hockey player who is known to be anything a single player who is known none of you bitch motherfuckers can even respond to the subject of this post answer or forfeit as a bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,youre being ridiculous
SubredditDrama,removed,nah
SubredditDrama,removed,those you whining about how horrible racism supposedly is dont have to live near the scourge of black america you can whine and cry about it and i dont give a fuck youre ignorant
SubredditDrama,removed,catcalling is a shitty thing to have happen to you if people talking to you is the worst thing that can happen to you you should probably lock yourself away and never come out again what would you call them minor annoyances and move on with my life like a normal human being and an actual strong independent woman
SubredditDrama,removed,being a bitch to someone because of their native language must feel pretty good huh
SubredditDrama,removed,what uasimplesauce saidwhich i guess was somehow controversial
SubredditDrama,removed,when it makes it appear that he is still a member of the klan half a century after quiting and renouncing the klan it is
SubredditDrama,removed,shopping a ex kkk member who spent the last atleast years apologizing for being a member for one year and speaking it against the group and working closely with naacp to make his apology mean something is revisionist history
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck rthedonald
SubredditDrama,removed,found the cuck
SubredditDrama,removed,context friend he still did tons for civil rights one racist word wont change the fact that he ended up working his damndest to make up for the things he did when he was young so kindly pipe the fuck down
SubredditDrama,removed,removed because you didnt link to any drama
SubredditDrama,removed,theres no point to be argued no dialogue to be had im simply pointing at reality you lot dont seem to be very well acquainted with it
SubredditDrama,removed,uthesilvertongue is the single most chronically single person in this sub even the dipshits from rtruecels who follow the totesmeta link here are less single than she is
SubredditDrama,removed,youre single arent you a man shows his true colors
SubredditDrama,removed,itt a lot of dudes who think compromise is when one person makes a demand and the other person meets them halfway in other words people who have no idea what a compromise actually is a compromise is when you reach a resolution to a dispute where both sides give something up protip giving your wife permission to feed your child andor leave the house isnt actually giving anything up
SubredditDrama,removed,but it is quite interesting that all the calls to compromise involve the woman just doing what the husband says and maybe as you suggest he just makes up for it in other ways why shouldnt the husband be compromising here instead especially since him compromising results in a better outcome this whole argument seems to be based on a faulty assumption that compromise is always good sometimes the middle ground is awful for example if the mother and father were arguing over vaccinations it would be ridiculous to compromise and only get the kid half his vaccinations or to spread them out or wait till hes older that would be a situation where the mother would have to put her foot down point out that the fathers requests arent at all reasonable and no compromise should be attempted i feel like a similar argument can definitely be proposed here where if there is any compromise to be made then itd be on the part of the husband who needs to compromise his feelings of discomfort so that his wifes already difficult job doesnt become more difficult
SubredditDrama,removed,and if theres one thing you know its being unreasonable
SubredditDrama,removed,the nursing cover ups benefit only ghee onlookers babies are not super pleased nursing with their heads covered and you spend the whole time trying to keep the cover on and not overheat or fight with an infant stress negatively affects let down too they are tits everyone has seen them before get over it
SubredditDrama,removed,yes because a womens breasts are equivalent to feces how utterly not chauvinist of you
SubredditDrama,removed,ill just quote myself here youre right let me go back and edit the part of my comment where i said that bodily autonomy is an unimpeachable reason to behave in any manner one prefers with no exceptions oh wait
SubredditDrama,removed,is correct in the point of a victim cant tell a prosecutor to drop a case they want to pursue or convince a prosecutor to file charges when the case looks weak its the prosecutors decision and theyll often make a case against victims wishes or not file a case when the victim wants to that said whether the victim is willing to cooperate will make a difference with the prosecutor and as for the cops not arresting the for raping the unconscious mother it probably would be a difficult case to prosecute yes her story describes rape but she also gave the kid drugs and alcohol and masturbated in front of him and his story of the incident likely wouldnt be rape so its unlikely to convince a jury beyond reasonable doubt in court eg he could claim she was hitting on him and they went off together or he woke her up and she then consented and shes now lying about it so her daughter doesnt think she deliberately slept with her boyfriend
SubredditDrama,removed,i also found this hilariously httpswwwredditcomuserthememeevent user as well ahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,as if we could trust those blm loonies to actually police themselves anywhere fuck blacks arent the only marginalized minority group in hogtown thats not a victory its a regression back into reverse racism territory
SubredditDrama,removed,you seem hella mad about blm
SubredditDrama,removed,lgbtq
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah a black woman being impolitely frustrated with white men really isnt tolerated youre correct
SubredditDrama,removed,op has an obvious agenda
SubredditDrama,removed,wow i use srs im literally part of an underground cabal that controls the admins and seeks to takeover all of reddit muahahahaha your freeze peach is
SubredditDrama,removed,because you people are so delusional you actually believe that crap if there was actually an sjw cabal that controlled the media i dont know what would happen but youd probably find actual evidence instead of hearsay and coincidences from umetaredditcancer just come on its ridiculous
SubredditDrama,removed,dude im not gonna play a catandmouse game of semantics and the specifics of language you know what i meant cheers
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a redditor for five years do you not remember the whole drama eith metaredditcancer his subreddit the witch hunt and the shadow bannings its the reason why rsubredditcancer exists every now and then they post and upvote the srs exposé goes into srs history and everything last time i checked they are on version
SubredditDrama,removed,not really sometimes it seems like the person im talking to is intentionally obtuse so i feel like its a waste of my time if i continue and get all stressed and what not after you use reddit for a while you find yourself typing comments and midway ask yourself if its really worth it and end up not saying anything and moving on
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont try to get too deep into it either theres alot of people that actually believe that though like way too many people the people who seem to care too much about this stuff are usually the same people that know this stuff so i assumed op was one of em
SubredditDrama,removed,because op is racist
SubredditDrama,removed,you cucks
SubredditDrama,removed,a bunch of regressive retards celebrate the censorship of a subreddit that triggers them lol none cares
SubredditDrama,removed,welcome to reddit where communities are selfmoderated and allowed to build an echo chamber to its own liking this has been especially the case in political subreddits where rules are largely enforced against people critical of that subreddits political candidate the only reason people are whining about this now is that rthedonald seemed to accomplish the impossible having a conservative subreddit be the dominant political community in the traditionally leftist website before when it was just liberal communities like sandersforpresident owning the top page and creating the echochamber no one complained
SubredditDrama,removed,i reported you to the fbi for this comment and have screencapped it as evidence you cannot just go around threatening to bomb the government dude i hope they just put the fear of god in you but youve gotta calm down we are on opposing sides of the political spectrum but that does not mean its okay to threaten death on your fellow man actions have consequences brother
SubredditDrama,removed,

SubredditDrama,removed,sexism is a weird weird thing
SubredditDrama,removed,and thats why you lost the election because you think that banning people makes them not exist anymore what youre supposed to do when you meet a racist is argue with them if you ban them from your conversations they simply go find another racist who will listen youre an idiot and well elect trump twice
SubredditDrama,removed,donald trump is the president elect of the united states
SubredditDrama,removed,donald trump is the president elect of the united states
SubredditDrama,removed,donald trump is the president elect of the united states
SubredditDrama,removed,and ellen pao demonstrates why she is clearly the better ceo also the amount of enjoyment im getting from this drama is only growing not only are we seeing rcheetobenito getting shit on at every turn but theres the added pleasure of watching reddit realize they vicicously attacked and defamed a much better ceo that defended their freeze peaches its like an allegory for this election
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah why dont they want to read a boring acronym over and over like a badass manly man would
SubredditDrama,removed,wow this sub got filled with retards
SubredditDrama,removed,does reddit hire adults seems like every ceo is a smug incompetent manchild with mild autism
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean if you want to get technical the very concept of moderation which this whole website is based on and relies on is censorship doesnt make it a bad thing
SubredditDrama,removed,oxus stop it i said it once and ill say it again stop it
SubredditDrama,removed,why is there always a strait white male telling everyone how minority communities and woman feel
SubredditDrama,removed,wow what a completely fucking idiotic thing for you to say just seriously fucking idiotic you think that i think everyone with a divergent opinion is a suspicious or b stupid just stop for a second is that what you truly believe or did you come across as a fucking retard just by accident to anyone with a brain stem you can see that im specifically intimating you are stupid if you consider the impact of spezs actions as a minor hiccup thats a little different than differing opinion stupid that you suggested and im really disappointed in you for acting like a scumbag

SubredditDrama,removed,what the fuck kind of word of mouth nonsense is that you should be skeptical of accusations of pretty much any ism these days
SubredditDrama,removed,forgive me if i have no sympathy but im bisexual and ive taken a bbc up my ass before with no trouble ah the best of reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,so many down votes that is odd the people of reddit are rushing to defend the fragility of the female organ

SubredditDrama,removed,nsfw to the max
SubredditDrama,removed,nsfw in case you didnt guess
SubredditDrama,removed,oh shit mansplaining is real
SubredditDrama,removed,thats true
SubredditDrama,removed,the issue is that its overused by femanazis and anyone trying to put an end to a conversation its a buzzword for anyone who disagrees with the opinions of others like the istsisms people resort to often
SubredditDrama,removed,i think that has less to do with the internet and more to do with having seen mad men it was a glorious time where you could knock up the new secretary and not pay child support where you could get hammered fight in the office and play with guns so long as you didnt piss yourself where being white and wearing a suit entitled you to a great job as long as you could keep your homosexuality secret where women had to marry you even if you were harry fucking crane because they werent allowed to buy food without a permission slip from a man how could you have been satisfied with after knowing thats how things could be thats why we got

SubredditDrama,removed,check out his history its a smorgasbord of that rthathappened my wifes friends are all snobs with desk jockey husbands three have asked my wife to use me as a bull not because im cute but im literally the picture of how to humiliate a rich well educated successful person have him watch his wife fuck a guy with no education no job of his own whos claim to fame is he married a girl who had her head on straight ¦ is it common for gay men to casually ask if you top or bottom like i dated a few guys in high school and i usually didnt ask until we were getting ready and spends much of his day posting in subreddits like rtumblrinaction and rpcmasterrace truly a tough man
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe if this sub was less trash
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a walking stereotype of the left
SubredditDrama,removed,much better was the old days of nooses and cutting off parts
SubredditDrama,removed,rethink life
SubredditDrama,removed,i was really confused most of the time you can detect the drama by the downvotes but they keep getting upvoted just because its prochoice and whos actually prochoice gets downvoted for saying and some people go oh crap time to get my stuff together and figure it out people are strange
SubredditDrama,removed,this is only tangentially related but one of my favorite things about being american is that the only real core requirement to be american is to want to be american its the magic of the melting pot if i moved to korea or something and magically got citizenship i still wouldnt be judged as properly korean you wanna be american do you love the america the nation at least not necessarily the state and want to be a part hop on board yeah there are some hoops to jump through for paperwork but if you want to come and contribute to society thats all we really need only the most staunch racists care about appearance as a qualifier to be in the club

SubredditDrama,removed,did anyone look through this female white nights history pretty great in no particular order sought advice for smoking a little early in pregnancy refers to roommate but then also says her parents always keep booze in the house so i suspect roommate is a sibling obviously had a kid draws hula hoop inspired pokemon works at chipotle and is having trouble with her direct deposit wants her indoor cat to transition to outdoors fascinating

SubredditDrama,removed,lol knew it of course you yanktards cant pass up on tripling down on the retardation
SubredditDrama,removed,fahrenheit is better of course lol no degrees is slightly too warm inside degrees is slightly too cool but is just right is a huge spread in fahrenheit but thats only approx degrees so you cant get that nice and specific sleeping temperature classic yankburger
SubredditDrama,removed,im going to say this fahrenheit was very useful for sailing darn celsius ruined sailing forever how could we ever measure body temprature nveer mind air temperature because everybody old ass ships had a thermometer up their ass and if it doesnt say exactly degrees f they lose their mind do you even realise that fahrenheit was not american in any way of course you did you are a genius
SubredditDrama,removed,antiamerican position that celsius is more accurate than fahrenheit and what makes fahrenheit american exactly genius httpsenwikipediaorgwikifahrenheit
SubredditDrama,removed,im in the usa so i have to add my personal story about this i needed a component part and there was only one shop left in town one that normally catered to industry i went in and its a son and dad operation the old man eventually after talking about the metric vs imperial system started going off about the imperial temperature system having more bandwidth so it was more accurate than celsius
SubredditDrama,removed,the money store was my first time
SubredditDrama,removed,single mothers are so hated on the stormfront page of the internet for reasons imo single mothers are some of the strongest most resourceful and independently minded women in society of course strong independently minded women really frighten conservatives single mothers are somehow responsible for the break down of the optimal most empirically logical scientific traditional family structure they have this image of single mothers as the women who shunned them in high school and college having fun and sleeping around with more attractive and eligible men before getting pregnant and now needing to beg the same stem majors who they shunned for financial support redditors love to hate single mothers because its an ego boost its a revenge fantasy and a toxic masculine power fantasy haha sluts now the tables have turned
SubredditDrama,removed,also while your at it if you dont mind deleting your account that would be just a huge help and wed all appreciate it so much thank you
SubredditDrama,removed,do you really follow this guy around to post how he thought trump was going to lose a month ago how mentally stable of you is that your professional opinion as general ed psych student
SubredditDrama,removed,thats not the case is too not a counter argument the fact i made an incorrect electoral prediction months ago has no bearing on me being right or wrong on fascism it is also not evidence of any stupidity on my part you know youll only end up making yourself look stupid by doing this then why did you threaten to have me banned over it are you so insecure that you cant even sit back in your stoic wisdom and let me make a fool of myself and ive been wrong before and graciously accepted it do you expect anybody other than your sock puppet accounts to believe this verifiable falsehood the ocean is both wet and salty while im neither fat nor little actually i think that youll find that you are in fact fat little wet and salty fascism is defined as an autocratic alliance between government and corporations bwahaha are you on a college campus right now youre soooo right thats the part that matters not the genocide slave camps and secret police no hes right leftists were the first victims of fascism in italy and in spain and of nazism leftists were also the victims of the commies remember trotsky so if shitting on leftists is a symptom of fascism as youre clearly trying to imply here then plenty of leftwing regimes are fascist as fuck the left eats itself all the time a duck expert wouldnt call a dog a duck what if he was on jimson weed or had frontal lobe damage your trust in the experts is as much a product of your lack of imagination as it is your superiority complex anyway your inability to discuss this rationally means im not interested in continuing in spite of the positive karma balance im getting out of this you dropped several fallacies and then complain about rationality yeah im sure you care about rational discourse and youre not just an elitist knob
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think i need professional training to make that call you know i havent got any professional training either and ive observed you demonstrate severe antisocial narcissistic tendencies creating fake support via sock puppetry for example like you said i dont need professional training to make that call
SubredditDrama,removed,after months of hearing about how if hillary wins its time to break out the guns i just dont care anymore why should i be upset if donald has to reap what hes sown all these people who were so proud to talk about how they would revolt if clinton won cant handle the fact that this street goes both ways ive had to listen to fuckwits talk about how oppressed they are for years despite the fact that they werent ever actually oppressed now its your turn fuck you fuck what you stand for fuck your party fuck your beliefs fuck your candidate fuck you personally

SubredditDrama,removed,ok i dont think you realize how much better i was performing when i was hacking that is phrased just such a way as someone with no moral compunction about hacking would say it but you werent performing better you were hacking if i had been hacking the whole time then i sure had been doing a shitty job of actually performing well with the hacks as people stated in that original link i posted also a lot of people start small with hacks and turn them up over time meh if you check my smashboards join date then youll see i had not been playing the game long when i asked those questions you also posted directly about your cheating saying something along the lines oh hell ill just copy paste it this was forever ago also the article is wrong the people that found out about the hacking didnt have the version of the hack where the changes were only active on port goggle pichu so a few months is forever but years on the board is not longparaphrased also more humbe bragtm about leet hacking skills you may be wondering why have i brought up humble brag so many times psychologically evident self satisfaction in people offering excuses is a telltale sign of people lying and thinking theyre getting away with it in person this is very often seen visibly as a smirk in an off mark there is a plethora of information on narcissticpathological and regular old liars and with what ive posted and now your direct reply to me youre only making that glove fit better like a second skin dont let the downvotes here fool you into thinking youre infallible as noted in that original thread and the stuff linked here there are loads of people not buying the elaborate story come to think of that elaborateness and the way you handle yourself as a whole that doesnt really fit with pediactric schizophrenia where sure there is a range but a full percent are borderline or fully intellectually disabled where presumably there is a fairly wide swath of people who arent disabled but still greatly impacted you sound like a smart kid for a kid but a rare case of childhood schizophrenic and the even rarer one who is still smart despite that thats a longer shot a much less tailored glove which is the point of all this looking at all the available evidence including direct interactionif limited by text im not convinced too many inconsistencies by one excuse too few by another part of that is how youre coping with doubt presented here and in other places most people who are seeing a doctor for such things arent going to ferret out every discussion about them around the internet and go on ad nauseum to try and convince everyone on the planet with a doubt the requirement for people to believe you here on an irrelevant subreddit strangers that you shouldnt have vested interest in convincingthat is exactly what many forms of liars would pursue with relish and zeal were exactly the thing a commonly lucid person with genuine delusion would learn to ignore or even avoid because it is unpleasant to bring it up to as many people as possible in other words not something most people with the affliction would wear on their sleeve certainly not someone who is clearly not severely inhibited by said afflictions for most with a relevant illness the struggle to be normal is consuming enough the would lean to not convincing random anonymous people that theyre the opposite of normal but for a recreational or compulsive liar the pity party in here is practically porn by all means you may indeed have some mental issues but im of the opinion that theyre not which youve claimed heres the kicker of that pathological liars often will lay claim to other illnesses which are not present may even come to believe them as such becoming something akin to a hypochondriac citation ive known a lot of liars compulsive yet somewhat innocent as well as pathological to a point where it disturbs their life ive had to deal with many for longer than youve been alive if you are actually seeing psychologistspsychiatrists i would certainly bring this possibility up to them it can lie along a similar psychopathy as schizophrenia among many other mental illnesses at any rate i do hope you manage to overcome whatever it is that actually ails you
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think youll ever have to worry about it you are never going to get laid
SubredditDrama,removed,cool story comrade
SubredditDrama,removed,you sound white and straight
SubredditDrama,removed,lgbtfo
SubredditDrama,removed,the only friend i have who supported trump is autistic
SubredditDrama,removed,seeing how clinton supports behaved ive been encouraging folks to remove them too yall nasty
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think every single trump voter is a bigot some of them i assume are nice people all of them did however turn a blind eye to bigotry maybe they naively think trump wont go through with all the bigotry hes been spewing maybe they think persecution and oppression of minorities is bad but unimportant or maybe theyre ignorant about what trump and his vp has said and done so sure theyre not all bigots but the alternatives are hardly flattering
SubredditDrama,removed,itt huge fans of sex with women who still support or excuse antiwoman policies that make sex riskier and costlier like limited contraceptives abortions sex ed planned parenthood protection of victims of sexual violence etc etc

SubredditDrama,removed,douchebag doesnt really have the same sex shaming aspect to it as sorostitute does

SubredditDrama,removed,lol rapist is way different than douchebag
SubredditDrama,removed,isnt that just thizztopias alt i assumed he got banned and just made that
SubredditDrama,removed,i may be it just seemed to me that you were sorta dismissing misogyny by comparing women slot shaming each other to dudes being called douchebags
SubredditDrama,removed,red skull is actually uciswhitemaelstrom confirmed
SubredditDrama,removed,whyd your other thread get deleted
SubredditDrama,removed,i hope you dont mind me snipping your quotes for length a little in a probably futile attempt to keep this from getting absurdly long dont worry this was a textwally conversation from the beginning and i enjoyes every piece of it so far and i hope you did too so the quoting you were looking for was this one because that is what mansplaining is its essentially we both know im wrong this feeling sucksso its easier to say it is misogyny driving you to point out that im wrong rather than you know me being wrong since you mentioned adamdaze i thought it was the other one this was written by servetusm so if my interpretation of what you said is correct there are three considerations to look for to detect mansplaining presumption of expertise condescending tone oriented to women can women womansplain should men be as outspoken about it as some women are i dont think servetusm presumed expertise whatsoever they just cast their opinion –with a sarcastic undertone– based on their perception about how women can denounce mansplaining done to them to avoid being questioned or criticized which apparently happened on adamdazes exchange casting emotionally loaded sarcastic opinions based on perceptions rather than facts is exactly the tone hsotd author did time and time again check this tasteful pinup art just lol this is the shirt we are talking about here its a bunch of scantilyclad women in suggestive poses nothing about that is tasteful if i found the tasteful who is op to criticize my taste some kind of art expert what if i just liked it what they call offensive or when i listen to the term i immediately remember about or but they probably dont fit the definition talk to a genderless crowd and are experts on what theyre talking about nbsp i dont know what you mean by sexism is true but its been demonstrated that men and womens brains work differently true that doesnt mean there are activities that people are impaired to do because of their gender the notion that the broader society has and has to be rejected but there are some activities where men have an upper hand because of biology and other where women have it which doesnt mean anyone should resign about doing anything just because other people with natural talent have it easier it just happens statistics statistics have to be used carefully which hardly anybody does pretty much everyone cites pie charts and descriptive tables as a support for their arguments second ammendment fights are especially draining because of this where its actually inferential statistics the one that take care about gathering data to adjust distributions calculate confidence intervals and correlating events even when a correlation has been found experts have to agree in scholarly consensus to claim event b is caused by event a and not just described by it to a certain confidence interval because im not american its hard for me to grasp the apparently astronomical level of racism and hatred there are between the social construct of races speaking about the argument about affirmative action is better than having nothing i might as well concede the point of its existence but the underlying problem is racism racists will always find a way to bind facts opinions or information to support their claims so calling out their explicit racism seems like the way to go no amount of affirmative action will make that change besides the segregation law is not in place anymore and i dare to say the modern situation is not nearly as bad as before biases at a first glance there are two major source of biases the conscious ones and the subconscious ones the conscious ones are formed by rationalized fear this are the most dangerous ones because people will feel threatened and act upon prejudice in an attempt to get out of a dangerous situation eg any muslim could be a terrorist i will get robbed or threatened in a neighborhood where africanamericans are the largest demographic group while not in one where caucasian are the largest group donald trump supporters irrational people this bias has its root on culture and it will be possible albeit hard for anybody who is willing open their minds and deal in a factual logical way to change their views subconscious biases on the other hand are pretty much hardwired in our brain as a survival mechanism that makes you want to cuddle and stay away from you know nothing about people and if they approach you a perfectly logical way would be to not have any biases towards them and greet them like any other human being but your gut feeling will probably tell you to steer clear of them and contact the police how do you know these guys are actually actors filming close to that place and would never harm you or that maybe they are reformed criminals undergoing a religious aa style therapy where they wear a replica of their uniform subconscious biases can be good and even if you wanted to get rid of them its pretty difficult thats why i understand wanting to get rid of subconscious bias –the one that deals with action in situations where a fast response can make a difference between life or death– in law enforcement officials but going for the general public is a bit of a stretch conscious biases attitudes towards groups of people on the other hand are more than desirable to change but then again the culture in which somebody is immersed makes it extremely hard to do so on occasions i think we can consider ourselves fortunate to have more plastic minds
SubredditDrama,removed,why not just delete his comments lol wont he just shit up this place

SubredditDrama,removed,yeah but the thing is that game was developed by a feeeeeeemale and one with uniquely colored hair and glasses at that
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah but you dont understand she was a fuckjing slut who wouldnt sleep with me
SubredditDrama,removed,you think its more likely that someone photoshopped some comments and that multiple people are lying about it than it is that this one shitbag unotanetsleshill got caught redhanded in a brazen and pathetic lie lmao right its all just a big conspiracy to frame this one douchebag you should venture over to mam youd fit right in with all the conspiracy theories
SubredditDrama,removed,your opinion is shit and you are a moron then stop defending mods behaving badly its really that simple and why in the fuck are you here reading and responding to comments if you dont care about it do you really think it makes you look less pathetic to pretend you dont care about the things you waste your time on this asshole unotanestleshill got caught in a lie and reacted like a little child bottom line
SubredditDrama,removed,you allow plenty of insults and attacks from your buddies theres a bunch of loons on that subreddit these days oh theyre not kids sadly theyre unemployed middle aged women with a lot of free time and a partner to mooch money off of to raise money for silly causes because they think theyre going to solve the case how stupid are these people its not the context its the word you daft fool both those subs are full of people with too much time on their hands trying their hardest to be an internet tracy dick thats probably before your time maybe youre more familiar with veronica mars why dont you at least apply the rules consistently if youre going to try and flex your mod muscle
SubredditDrama,removed,i dunno they want to go back in time to an era before women and other minorities talked back to them it makes a weird kind of sense if they are the same group that idolizes games from the good old days of years ago too
SubredditDrama,removed,blacks have to be perfect in order for me to respect them is what im getting out of this comment
SubredditDrama,removed,get sexy women out of my videogames grow up
SubredditDrama,removed,muh pixelated butts
SubredditDrama,removed,okay sorry maybe you are the slow one lets start from the top i said what was selfrighteous about what he said that reddit is filled with cringey white middle class males because anticlinton manufactured butt controversy rants and plain animated butts get upvoted to the top you replied with that is literally his beef that the drama about butts and politics are indicative of reddits demographic which implies that only straight white men like butts and politics which is childish and moronic then i said pretend i am a bit slow explain to me how you interpreted anticlinton circlejerk manufactured butt controversy about sjws stealing animated butts horny young white men jerking off to overwatch butts only straight white men like butts and politics i cannot go any slower than this i still am not following your logic or lack there of seeing as how you are also pissing on the popcorn in that original thread seems like this butt drama is affecting you a lot too
SubredditDrama,removed,what is with all the its about class in society comment on this thread
SubredditDrama,removed,why is he a uh pussy
SubredditDrama,removed,bad take
SubredditDrama,removed,youre like the kid who took her first psych class and thinks shes an expert on the human mind lmao
SubredditDrama,removed,can unreddit be faked
SubredditDrama,removed,i think thats bullshit but ok
SubredditDrama,removed,just so were clear you dont consider any of these to be insults or personal attacks im going to assume you are one of the whiners that was dumb enough to get your last account either banned or suspended theres a bunch of loons on that subreddit these days how stupid are these people its not the context its the word you daft fool oh theyre not kids sadly theyre unemployed middle aged women with a lot of free time and a partner to mooch money off of to raise money for silly causes because they think theyre going to solve the case theyre too busy worshipping the ambulance chaser kathleen zeller and spending the time they used to spend playing farmville making timelines and crazy crackpot theories to slightly modify a jimmy mcgill quote some people are immune to being sensible does that have anything to do with who posted these by chance
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks for confirming what i learned when i dated men a blowjob is a handshake cunnilingus is asking her to marry you
SubredditDrama,removed,dont be a dick
SubredditDrama,removed,uwilliamfbuckleysfist must be one of the most pathetic people ive ever seen on reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,im cuddling with my kitty right now if you think my current account is bad you should have seen the time i went through the post history of a woman with fat in her username and told her that her recent miscarriage was her fault because shes fat my kitty is the best widdle kitty
SubredditDrama,removed,soundgarden sucks too
SubredditDrama,removed,that archos guy is a fucking misogynist for using the word cunt amirite srd

SubredditDrama,removed,ujpwhoregan former donald mod
SubredditDrama,removed,what does trumps ass smell like with your head so far up it
SubredditDrama,removed,actually its about ethics in video games journalism

SubredditDrama,removed,really though am i an asshole do i come off that way
SubredditDrama,removed,no you know what i dont care dont even tell me you got some nerve i oughta fuck the teeth out of your mouth
SubredditDrama,removed,especially not from a confused dude like you
SubredditDrama,removed,youre being kinda negative of a woman this is srd its not about about drama you see its about supporting womyn bonus points if youre
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,when srd makes a caricature of itself
SubredditDrama,removed,like circlebroke
SubredditDrama,removed,we shall oust lady eve
SubredditDrama,removed,she has been harassing and stalking me are you going to address this or not she personally led a campaign to ruin my reputation

SubredditDrama,removed,httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdrama
SubredditDrama,removed,see your mistake was skipping beer at breakfast
SubredditDrama,removed,god drinking in arizona heat sounds so unappealing
SubredditDrama,removed,quite possibly the most trivial thing somebody can complain about your lilfe is empty and without any sort of struggle whatsoever if you give this much of a shit about geek culture
SubredditDrama,removed,it makes me lol because the og ghost busters is literally only points better than the recent ghost busters on metacritic ghost busters was never ever a master piece of a franchise it has always just been a goodforawatch disposable movie fun but not a classic at all
SubredditDrama,removed,gaming culture is a complete fucking shit hole time after time after time after time after time after time after time again why am i even surprised if i ever have kids im making damn sure they dont play video games all the fucking time so they dont have to be exposed to this backwards garbage from the community
SubredditDrama,removed,you wont be finding mecca down in moms basement so i call shenanigans
SubredditDrama,removed,its seriously the most normal fucking thing sometimes i look at people on srd and wonder what world they live in like how big of a fucking pussy can you be about things srd always shows me
SubredditDrama,removed,youre dumb as bricks
SubredditDrama,removed,when it comes to misusing meme words i have yet to find any group that isnt guilty so not always but here yes
SubredditDrama,removed,do you really want to engage ulateregg in a shitpost off against rafl you lot would get destroyed haha
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off no its not if you cant tell one vag from another it is t
SubredditDrama,removed,larger than what people might find out oh noes you might be teh gay
SubredditDrama,removed,except its a victimless crime no matter how hard you kick and punch and scream like a little baby
SubredditDrama,removed,uhh except they just used it as a comparison you dense piece of cake
SubredditDrama,removed,really hung up on someone being unemployed you bang a hobo
SubredditDrama,removed,so its rape if youre an idiot and i dont want to fuck an idiot but somehow someone like you slips bydont worry theres not a chance in hell you would slip by
SubredditDrama,removed,quote me then or stfu i didnt call it rape anywhere you mong
SubredditDrama,removed,thank you fuck this person is retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,lol these creeps cross posted this to mgtow
SubredditDrama,removed,or this some very angry and swarthy characters in this thread
SubredditDrama,removed,well it makes me feel icky when i bed a moron you are really hung up on morons did a moron touch your nono
SubredditDrama,removed,you really are fucking retarded let me guess youre using an app and are too fucking lazy to open your browser and navigate to the desktop site is that it
SubredditDrama,removed,their comments calling me triggered are fine but saying this guy was with a transperson is transphobic how
SubredditDrama,removed,when did even say rape enjoy wanting to be angry at things
SubredditDrama,removed,is just way more easier holy fuck learn some grammar
SubredditDrama,removed,its the greatest irony that the people who love scolding the black community and telling them to fix themselves are the same people who do not want to fix the problems within their country but are gungho about remembering that one time when the attack came from outside
SubredditDrama,removed,its funny how the colin kaepernick protest really just shows that a portion of americans just dont want black people to protest ever or to do it out of sight and quietly
SubredditDrama,removed,well if everyone in the magic community felt this way then wed never have any women playing i know i wouldnt play but thankfully not everyone is as narrowminded i dont use this term often because i honestly hate it but you do realize that youre mansplaining to me right now right
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck pc culture they took a cute picture of two people celebrating the end of a war that lasted six years and was probably a second fucking kiss anyway and turned it into this whole psychoanalytical debate on whether she wanted it or not fuck pc culture fuck it fuck it fuck it
SubredditDrama,removed,of course he starts whinging about iq differences in races it was only a matter of time before ser logic of west coontownshire outs himself
SubredditDrama,removed,redditors deny plenty of genocides and its disgusting just look at people who say what stalin or mao did was exaggerated seriously most of the socialistcommunist sub could provide endless content for rbadhistory
SubredditDrama,removed,money trumps everything in business money is more important than race or anything else im the ignorant one because i think if a black man is more qualified for a high ranking position and has more potential earning power he will be hired and not passed over because hes black
SubredditDrama,removed,i was hoping someone would post this here my first incitement of subreddit drama oh and bro working on the floor of best buy isnt comparable to high ranking positions in the business and finance sector
SubredditDrama,removed,degenerados como ti deben morir en la cruz
SubredditDrama,removed,reddits disdain for the working poor never ceases to amaze me i swear if most of these geniuses turns out to be min wage workers themselves i might have to let go of my faith in humanity i work in an airconditioned office for nine hours a day my daily work hazards involve boss catching me reading manga when i should be working and getting chased by wild dogs on my way to work i dont think my job is more strenuous than someone manning the grille at mcdonalds hell my job is much easier than someone manning the counter at mcdonalds if someone gets in my face in my job i can just shut down my im client for a demographic of mostly atheists there sure are a lot of redditors following the prosperity gospel
SubredditDrama,removed,so here is what iseewithsound said for posterity i deleted it so i didnt have to deal with idiots like you who think they understand the subject making long tired responses on something youve never actually studied in your life nah you deleted it because someone called you on your bullshit early on and rather than dealing with it you realized youre out of your depth and flounced i have multiple degrees ive gone down the rabbit hole youre welcome to continue to pretend to be knowledgeable on this because you read a book or two but you arent yeah im sure you do have multiple degrees out of morbid curiosity since i shifted though your post history and saw that you havent posted in any history related subs what are your degrees in presumably if it was something history related you would have posted in those subs after all one doesnt get degrees in history for the pay one gets them because its a subject matter they enjoy and yet no posts hmm how odd kindly delete this post so i can keep my inbox free of the ignorant masses clamoring to pretend to understand a subject that they like you have never actually studied you got called on it in minutes and rather than addressing what you were called on or the subject matter of this threadwhats going on in the rbadhistory thread you hit delete and ran that isnt exactly the mark of someone who has given anything more than a passing glance on the subject you can lie to yourself but not to me
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think this is a very productive conversation were having here thats because youre an idiot literally everyone here agrees that nukes are a horrible weapon however for the situation of getting japan to surrender they were by far the most humane and carried the lowest loss of life than any other method that would have taken months possibly years of time time which would be spent killing japanese people starving japanese people and displacing japanese families
SubredditDrama,removed,id like to thank uxtrasloppy for my new favorite saying a cat can have kittens in the oven but that doesnt make them biscuits dr mary lets see how many times i can shoehorn it into a conversation today
SubredditDrama,removed,dude that article is referencing shit from the a lot has changed since then feelz over realz jesus christ just keep crying racism over everything and the root of the problem will never change
SubredditDrama,removed,not an argument thank you for contributing nothing to the discussion
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess you didnt get the joke chin up youll have the mental capabilities of a grader one day
SubredditDrama,removed,not an argument thank you for contributing nothing to the discussion why dont you take a long fucking hard suck on my big fat greasy pendulous swinging dick you fucking pussy
SubredditDrama,removed,you just know the dudes complaining about it have no issues jerking it to bad lesbian porn lets be real here
SubredditDrama,removed,why is it so hard for girls to accept that two guys can just be friends its so weird ive only ever noticed it with straight girls i think its because so many of them have terrible relationships with their friends that they dont really like and only keep around for social status this is hilarious given that a like of all popular media is about some straight dudes totally platonic brofriendship b there is very little out there about platonic friendship between two women or a woman and a man what is it with dudes that they dont accept that a woman and a man can just be friends
SubredditDrama,removed,thats actually pretty funny
SubredditDrama,removed,oh so when chicks do it its empowering a marginalized group and not objectification got it
SubredditDrama,removed,but what about the menz
SubredditDrama,removed,ya i mean they were an aggressive expansionist empire with a strong emphasis on racial cleansing oh you mean like the british did in africa or the soviets did in eastern europe or the united states did in the american west nazis were bad guys but so were stalin and winston churchill there was a huge famine in british india churchill refused to redirect food and millions of indians died his response was why hasnt gandhi died yet he was a horrible horrible murderer he even advocated using gas on uncivilised peoples stalin of course was a genocidal tyrant who needs no explanation hitler was a monster but so were churchill and stalin wasnt goodies vs baddies it was baddies vs baddies the fact that nazis were bad doesnt make the british or the soviets good no more than the british or the soviets being bad makes the nazis good of course srd will argue me on this because its a closeminded black and white sjw shithole

SubredditDrama,removed,well theyre a bunch of whiny teenagers who live with their suburban republican parents theyre trying to lash out against their ideal upbringing by making edgy comments on the internet so what does this have to do with liberals well they grew up listening to their bush voting parents blame shit on liberals so rather than forming their own opinions on the evil liberal boogeyman they have coopted the term to mean the moderates who wont conform to their edgy views
SubredditDrama,removed,indeed although the bloodthirsty nuts may outnumber the grownup leftists on reddit the non psycho ones get more shit done
SubredditDrama,removed,except they dont modern science and medicine agree with me that its a mental disorder one whose best treatment right now is indulging the fantasy i havent given up hope that we can come up with better in the future im not attacking anybody im refusing to pretend that somebody with a penis is a woman im sure theres no shortage of overweight neonhaired individuals whod like to explain why thats a bad idea but i tend not to listen to a baristas opinion on anything but coffee
SubredditDrama,removed,looks like a sub where the craziest of crazies from ranarchism go to or maybe rsocialism idk theyre both full of dumbasses
SubredditDrama,removed,i just want to say that princekropotkin was banned from both ranarchism and rsocialism for good reason dont believe a word that comes out of this racist homophobic ableist mouth
SubredditDrama,removed,can you drop the hyperbole for one moment nowatdaddioh never said government agents were trying to kill him wtf is wrong you your compulsive lying is really worrying at this point all they said was they were doxxed by an israeli guy who made death threats
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,censorship in my srd its more likely than you think
SubredditDrama,removed,really rimgur are we pulling a as a faggot i dont find the word offensive card god i hate this community
SubredditDrama,removed,to be fair this uawakenedsaxon red flag right there isnt really arguing against violence against fascists as much as hes using leftwing provocations to defend a poster hung up in a swedish neighbourhood calling for the murder of race traitors
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit loves feminism if it means they can shit on muslims reddit loves lgbtq rights if it means they can shit on christiansmuslims perhaps theres a bit of a pattern here
SubredditDrama,removed,in the time it took you to write that wall of text you could have put at least bullets through your skull
SubredditDrama,removed,can you exactly deny the dems are anything but center right or just make shitty overplayed jokes what exactly is leftist about neoliberal doctrine in any way please enlighten me smuglord
SubredditDrama,removed,only yours baron only yours normal people who arent rich on their way down have their own lives that arent consumed by hate hows life in the führerbunker
SubredditDrama,removed,this comment can stay ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
SubredditDrama,removed,form of cognitive bias or logical fallacy check misused check were definitely on reddit folks
SubredditDrama,removed,considering you take factual statements as hostility im afraid if i stuck my dick in you all the concentrated hatred might make it shrivel and fall off then again i like to live dangerously ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
SubredditDrama,removed,one more day until the storm
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks for posting here because now i can call you an idiot and downvote you without getting banned you are mentally deficient
SubredditDrama,removed,no no no its just to trigger the sjws in retaliation for them triggering the righteous white man
SubredditDrama,removed,poly people should be metaphorically gassed
SubredditDrama,removed,you mean like how white kids will kidnap a black kid say fuck hillary and fuck blacks stab him then the police call it non racially motivated and not political
SubredditDrama,removed,the best thing you can do is let their bullshit bounce off of you it didnt work well for you in this discussion did it imagine if you had been bullied all your life and someone told you to just let that shit bounce off it doesnt work that way what i find weird is how radically focused some people are in insisting that nerd culture is systemically broken from the topdown were being critical of attitudes n nerd culture that arent just confined to small groups but have indirect widespread support and tacit approval it doesnt mean all of nerd culture is bad quite the opposite there are many good parts that are worth defending and improving all sorts of hobbies having an equal number of loud obnoxious assholes i dont care about other hobbies i care about this one
SubredditDrama,removed,but these assholes do it to everybody not just women its funny how you claim theres no widespread problems in nerd culture then explain how these guys bigotry is widespread and not just limited to women
SubredditDrama,removed,oh look the selfhating nerd rears its ugly head such thick skin
SubredditDrama,removed,mmm mmm bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,mmm mmm bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,gamers are entitled garbage fires
SubredditDrama,removed,too bad theres no rule about being a horrible human being youd have to ban most of the posters in this thread
SubredditDrama,removed,every time a redditbeard gets mad about women a feemale gets her extra e
SubredditDrama,removed,ufoo and rfoo only parse if they are lowercase rfoo breaks i wonder if ufoo deleted a bunch of posts if not hes yearold account nice but hes not completely dead latest post was month ago playing the long con no comments for the first years wow a total of comments over lifetime average of comments per year average gain of commentkarma per year this dudelady is inhuman he must be the king of rtotallynotrobots
SubredditDrama,removed,yo rcurvy im really happy for you ima let you finish but rfatpeoplehate was the best sub and fascist mods killed it
SubredditDrama,removed,idiots ew ew ew very problematic go back to leftypol you autist neckbearded brocialist s
SubredditDrama,removed,i hope you enjoy my video care to subscribe to my channel ilovesinging tv
SubredditDrama,removed,because the title showed a startling lack of concern for random redditors precious penises
SubredditDrama,removed,are you thesilvertongue be honest
SubredditDrama,removed,in spencers case he called himself a nazi so there really isnt that much grey area open for interpretation now why would redditors be hand wringing over someone mistakenly thinking they are white supremacists while cheering on cars driving through blm protests
SubredditDrama,removed,what looks
SubredditDrama,removed,i think the essential problem here is that supposing fascism or nazism were on a successful run that they would eventually be able to by whatever means assume power at some stage then violence against them becomes not only justifiable but downright necessary because of the nature of the beast that is fascism this point has to take place some time before they get into power since democratic means to combat them become useless after that so the fundamental question is how do we determine the stage at which violence against fascists is a net positive when does it become too late would people know when the time comes this isnt easy its not even easy to find out if fascism is truly on the rise that inaction will lead to a lot of suffering this is central i think to this whole debate fascism breaks democracy it changes the rules so that pacificism cant be assumed to always be the best approach in the case of richard spencer im not going to shed any tears for him in fact its mighty satisfying to see him getting suckerpunched but i dont think the us is at the point where violence is the answer or even if they will reach that point but as i said knowing this is extremely difficult its vital to not be too late
SubredditDrama,removed,nazis are free to say whatever they want they should just expect a fist to the face when they advocate genocide and push their pseudoscientific racism
SubredditDrama,removed,hes lucky it was just a punch if it were me id be introducing him to the good old colombian necktie or flowervase the flowervase is best shows them the kind of people they are fucking with
SubredditDrama,removed,if youre familiar with silver youve basically been her standin the past few days its weird because you didnt used to be like this
SubredditDrama,removed,i never said it wasnt was just correcting the poster who claimed dick spencer was punched by a black guy i never implied anything about the hate crime spike i had family die in wwii my year old great uncle starved to death during nazi occupation i consider the puncher a hero so kindly fuck off with your random assumptions
SubredditDrama,removed,you people have got to pay attention to history this shit was years ago and people have completely forgotten what made nazis so evil quit fucking arguing in bad faith and go learn about how the world almost ended
SubredditDrama,removed,your inability to understand context applies to your reading comprehension too i see
SubredditDrama,removed,by ubethlooknerhttps
SubredditDrama,removed,oh no no democracy is the tyranny of the majority its going to be all consensus voting from here
SubredditDrama,removed,the ss would be lawful to purge dissidents you said its good for violence against ideologies you dont like that includes them persecuting you friend
SubredditDrama,removed,yes it is an opinion im sorry you are from such a backwards society that you cant grasp it
SubredditDrama,removed,i bet that bitch had nothing to say about king pussyhands being a good role model in the white house key word white house
SubredditDrama,removed,nazis dont throw the first punch nazis burn the first reichstag i thought this quote was pretty fitting we can wait until they take over a country and kill them in a long and bloody war or we can knock them the fuck out now spencer isnt just someone people might disagree with or whatever he is a literal fascist who advocates for genocide if you just let him do that freely he will gain support pretty much any means are justified to stop him from that
SubredditDrama,removed,lol i cant take you leftists seriously at all with all the fucking apologia of dictatorship and authoritarian rule tell me more about what a lovely fairy dream land cuba is sempai
SubredditDrama,removed,goddamned white people in space is nothing sacred
SubredditDrama,removed,im mostly annoyed that this sub is overzealously modded to the point where it barely has content anymore lol no i still see plenty of nonsurplus drama submitted all the time more than enough to keep me satisfied throughout the day ive seen your dae think reddit is bad comments here and im not impressed youre just angry that the mods are putting their foot down and wont let you grandstand here as they should you can deny it all you want but you and i both know its true now if you want to bitch about how much reddit sucks while still on reddit go to cb but keep it out of srd people are sick and tired of it
SubredditDrama,removed,at what point are we just going to admit that the admins are probably just part of the altreich
SubredditDrama,removed,the definition of sjw seems to have widened to include anybody who thinks basic human decency is alright
SubredditDrama,removed,thats terrible but it happens the other way too actual sjws like to label anyone with even a minor quibble as altright bigot assholes to much of that false dichotomy sentiment going around if the political spectrum is a horseshoe the two ends are both dipped in shit more or less equally if we could somehow excise them both the world would be much better off the more central types often sit out because they dont want to ally with either side
SubredditDrama,removed,i really wish i would have saved the comment srd linked to once where someone was calling people sjw who disagree with fucking dogs as in youre a sjw if you are against a human having sexual relations with a dog

SubredditDrama,removed,yo anyone notice that the number of votes on spezs comment is rapidly changing it was almost at negative votes and i look again and its only negative theres no way in fuck people are upvoting his comment so that means theres some continued fuckery going on
SubredditDrama,removed,if it were up to you youd just ban td entirely ayyy go fuck yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,really this behavior is what people expect from trump the guy whose supporters he was trying to troll
SubredditDrama,removed,it was the entirety of liberal reddit flying the banner of rsweden vs rthedonald after that one afternoon the low energy rswedens gave up plus their irl countrys getting overrun and literally fucked by rapefugees they wont have a country in the next years if theyre lucky 😂
SubredditDrama,removed,been around reddit for a while ive been here longer than your little fucking shit ass shut the fuck up with your bullshit if you think im going anywhere your fucking kidding yourself eat a bag of shit you censor enabling cuck

SubredditDrama,removed,how hard did you cum after you hit save on that comment
SubredditDrama,removed,nothing was taken seriously during clintons email investigation the whole thing was an elaborate practical joke

SubredditDrama,removed,so are you saying that all that i posted is a lie trump never lied they didnt push fake news stories they didnt spend a whole hell of a lot of time pushing stupid pictures and memes the comments are a wonderful discussion of the political topics no bots were used if you admitted to the shit show that most of it is then i will admit that some good things came out of the sub but so far all i have seen is that they are comparing it to the gold standard along the line hillary did with tpp
SubredditDrama,removed,weaponized autism at its finest
SubredditDrama,removed,stop trying to gaslight me none of that is evidence and you know it
SubredditDrama,removed,before rthedonald existed i always thought that comic was unfair i now understand that there are evils so utterly depraved that no decent person can interact with them without developing an intense nostalgia for the rack
SubredditDrama,removed,you have a point but i want this guy to be hit by a car really badly so please run him over uspez

SubredditDrama,removed,sources on this fascism thing please oh and i am a learned black man who has studied history as it has impacted my lineage greatly please do not to patronize me unjustly
SubredditDrama,removed,irrelevant libcuck opinion 😂
SubredditDrama,removed,you saw the constant manipulation from ctr in the sub td isnt allowed to talk about no you didnt not everyone who disagrees with you is some sort of paid shill you paranoid weirdo remember hillary won the popular vote by nearly two million votes in the us and she did especially well among the demographic the same demo that makes up a huge bulk of reddits userbase it would have been very fucking weird if there werent pockets on reddit where the community was quite noticeably prohillary
SubredditDrama,removed,presumably so that theyll know who to award medals to
SubredditDrama,removed,lol stressed out what a beta male faggot hahah
SubredditDrama,removed,apparently uspez doesthe whole point of this debacle you idiot

SubredditDrama,removed,reddit admin default mod slack chat leaked default mods petition spez to ban rthedonald httpsslimgazxwjzh leaked by uunimatrixzeroone
SubredditDrama,removed,here httpsslimgazxwjzh
SubredditDrama,removed,better than you incoherent comment to it its like a reaction of a baked person that doesnt seem to realize his impairment
SubredditDrama,removed,ok moron
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a dumbass
SubredditDrama,removed,the real question is when is bill gonna give up his ape
SubredditDrama,removed,wit your mom youre a pile of trash take yourself to the curb with your mama where you belong
SubredditDrama,removed,whaaaat people deny other people huma rights that is so obscene if you laugh at that you must be the most generic dude in the whole world that really never has to deal with any of this stuff or to hurt your feelings im calling you a sheltered crybaby that needs more safe space than any minority
SubredditDrama,removed,reread maybe comprehension is a problem as well thats not what i wrote but i guess you read what you want to read and not whats actually written
SubredditDrama,removed,im not sure if youve kept track of reddit events lately from back in the td mods have engaged in massive harassment of rpolitics modteam with cwm and viking successively being in charge its only lately with the banishment of viking from their ranks that theyve somewhat lessened their attacks on us if there are any talks of td needing to be dealt with its entirely due to their actions i would also suggest trying to mod a community that is being disrupted by external forces before talking about something you have very little idea about theyve doxxed three of my comods stickied said articles to the top and they have received no punishments the admins are being very lenient with td
SubredditDrama,removed,just look at the shitshow called rpolitics that sub is worthy of an rmandelaeffect post since the election even if you vehemently hate trump i just cant believe some of the posts there that make it to the top can be upvoted by a large swath of humans the rpolitics community has never in its history been so biased and hateful it seems like either lots of people who were not fanatical antitrumpers left that sub or it has been manipulated as an anti rthedonald that sub was specifically chosen because it is an automatic subreddit lots of readers and because it was about politics it was the only sub that they could make compete with this revelation it seems more and more true and it is depressing hyperbole btw not literally
SubredditDrama,removed,say it with me fuck trump
SubredditDrama,removed,so wait apparently some rthedonald idiots vandalized a mods car from these leaked chat logs known and proven
SubredditDrama,removed,please go back to voat with the rest of the autist nazis
SubredditDrama,removed,fuckheads got onto the internet at last
SubredditDrama,removed,who gives a shit i wish all you scum could be gone so this site could be pleasant again
SubredditDrama,removed,im fine with anything that hurts you fucks
SubredditDrama,removed,if that kind of attitude prevailed among subreddit mods then youre bound to see a lot more mod abuse and what would you call conspiring with the rest of the mods of default subs of reddit to ban the subreddit that supports the republican president elect regular mod behavior if that above chat log is normal to all of you and it appears to be every single one of you should have your moderator status removed youre a bunch of fucking control freaks who are throwing a massive hissyfit that the ceo wont back your desire to strangle any opinions besides your own you can go fuck yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,your mind is shot beyond medical help at this point
SubredditDrama,removed,typical rpolitics mod always lying
SubredditDrama,removed,men are also the most common perpetrators of violent crime you fucking idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,nah sorry proud liberal want nothing to do with those places
SubredditDrama,removed,true but so does everyone on thedonald
SubredditDrama,removed,and you keep being a bigot
SubredditDrama,removed,because there are mods with a massive bias and should not be in charge of moderating a subreddit uimnotjesus as a perfect example
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit deserves it they pandered with the free speech bullshit to the libertarian kind of college boy just look at the rall and see who is having a field day with this accusing everyone of being a shill now proves them right because they have the smoking gun which apparentely turns into a gatling gun reddit fucking deserves such a downfall in quality and common decency the best part is the free speecher screamers they fight for subs that have draconic rules and ban anyone disagreeing in it reddit didnt close the cesspools off this website down and let them grow and fester maybe its because all the gilding they did made them turn the other cheek because money is what it is about and reddit isnt exactly healthy financially screw them they invited the alt right if you invite facism you shouldnt be surprised it does what fascism does
SubredditDrama,removed,best thing is people now saying this dude is a ctr shill ayyy because that is something clinton stands for gun violence
SubredditDrama,removed,this is fucked up he can edit literally anything on reddit he wants and itll be untraceable this is scary fuck uspez
SubredditDrama,removed,dude theyre a hate group find another hill to die on cuz that ship has sailed
SubredditDrama,removed,i have autism
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe all those retards will finally leave reddit its amazing watching how clidish rthedeplorables is acting about this make reddit great again rspez is the man
SubredditDrama,removed,reminds me of something else recently never mind we shouldnt talk about this because russia
SubredditDrama,removed,wahhh i literally cant handle the fact that there are other subreddits that are interested in different things your tears are delish
SubredditDrama,removed,youre so unbelievably full of shit its hurting my brain pls stop podestas little child abuse gallery and serial killer sculptures the emails referencing pizza and pasta in bizarre ways that dont make any sense in normal sentence structure while pizza and pasta are code words for little boy and girl the block of restaurants all with fbirecognised paedo symbols with an instagram account related to one of the restaurants sharing many images of little kids bound i love children shirts and weird chambers with murder attatched etc and the links photos etc connecting people like clinton to said restaurant the tranny singer of heavr breathing band who performed at the restaurant filmed laughing about the managers taste for little boys the fact that podesta bros are longtime and current friends of convicted pedos but yeah no facts or anything just crazy tin foil conspiracies haha amirite
SubredditDrama,removed,it is not fucking sarcasm you smug idiot if you disagree then respond and have your ego demolished you are so far up your own ass that you immediately dismiss opposing points of view as satire enjoy your echo chamber
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahaha busted the leaked slack shows some of the mods are paid by ctr suck it loser
SubredditDrama,removed,did i say ban or is that a straw man youre building
SubredditDrama,removed,i am not saying its true or not true i tend to heavily lean very towards not true but they did find pretty amazing evidence of something really disturbing going on this website has turned into an sjw cancer ban everything we dont agree with
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit went from a website with news and intersting information from all over the world to a political platform not everyone lives in the states not everyone cares about the states you love trump fine but this up voting circlejerk is starting to get annoying if you are shiting all over reddit in for the past year with your content and now you feel offended well there is many people feeling offended with all that trump nonsense for a while now but we didnt start posting sjw and cucks left and right and calling for the ceo to resign like children
SubredditDrama,removed,bwahaha uspez get cucked
SubredditDrama,removed,and what do they do besides trigger you someone here please come out of the bubble and explain which posts from td are racist or hateful that have made the front page fuck its like you guys only talk to eachother and have created this td boogeyman in your mind that literally eats black children
SubredditDrama,removed,nobody claimed liberals were consistent
SubredditDrama,removed,how is pizzagate stupid care to be specific
SubredditDrama,removed,who gives a shit if you make a girl cry because youve exposed her as a social justice warrior
SubredditDrama,removed,not special we memed donald fucking trump into the white house wow something to be proud of really brings a tear to my eye thinking how wondeful this country is that a man with no political experience can be memed into office with buzzwords racism and a fucking pepe meme really makes me proud of our country especially when that guy admitted he underestimated how much work went into being leader of the most powerful country on earth you guys picked a smart one
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahahahahahahaha and then you get busted youre pathetic
SubredditDrama,removed,what exactly are they outraged about here that the mods are regular human beings that want their shitty hate group wiped off the face of the earth because that sentiment is a little more common than you fucking idiots realize
SubredditDrama,removed,oh yeah ohhhh yeah
SubredditDrama,removed,whats the best example you can think of demonstrating how they are one
SubredditDrama,removed,he would die for the right of these internet forums to exist literally fucking die

SubredditDrama,removed,if you didnt know this was possible you are a fucking idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,digital posts are obviously editable by anyone with access to the database you being incapable of understanding the trivialities of the medium you are using is an indictment of yourself more than anything

SubredditDrama,removed,to anyone reading this that thinks racism is tolerated at rthedonald just do an experiment try and post something with a racist title and see how long it lasts there dont take my word for it and most certainly do not take umylifeformeyers word for it just try it for yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,haha thats not true besides americans have the second amendment right didnt you just say that this gives them the right to own things like shotguns you edited your comment so i forget can you help remind me please
SubredditDrama,removed,its like squashing a bug the guts go everywhere but you can wash them off and be rid of them for a while
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry you get so upset over nothing ever think that maybe people cant stand you for a reason edit jkjk uregandryke has a big penis and the ladies love him not just his mother
SubredditDrama,removed,lol tryhard
SubredditDrama,removed,whats retarded is the fact that people for some reason assume that reddit posts would ever be admissible evidence also its funny that lines get drawn towards a political agenda when all he did was edit hate posts against himself which was actually quite funny its clearly retarded that he did this but can td please stop being absolute autistic for just a few moments and realize that this wasnt a liberalistplot hundreds of years in the making but a normal person making bad decisions
SubredditDrama,removed,reddittxt
SubredditDrama,removed,i said a lot is possible not everything i also said women are different this being said without an underlying medical condition like vaginismus and with patience a lot is possible ive been in relationships where the build up to penetrative sex took weeks but when the moment arrives and if you take your time with foreplay you eventually get there obviously some positions were a no go hence patience and consideration in a long term relationship when you really care about each other you make it work i can and do understand why some women wouldnt and dont want to wait that long especially if theyre afraid it would never work if a woman has experienced pain in the past in all likelihood shell initially find it hard to relax properly i do worry that some have simply had bad experiences with uncaring lovers who thought foreplay consisted of minutes of oral and sex means porno star pounding ie huge dicks with big dicks ive had girls outright say no it takes too long you have to be careful some things simply arent possible its not worth the effort its a shame men who are insecure about their size dont realize that being too big is just as likely to be a deal breaker as being too small somewhere around average is best and the dick isnt even that important when getting a woman off i should probably end this comment with a selfdeprecating sex pun about being downvoted but i cant think of one this comments already much too big i hope it didnt hurt anyones feelings
SubredditDrama,removed,oh obviously putting in a minimum of minutes of foreplay every time can get very annoying i understand perfectly if many women dont want that especially if theyre younger once again i said a lot is possible more than some of the younger women i have known initially thought not that you can pop in the groceries or a loaf of bread obviously im talking from my limited experience the feelings thing was a failed pun directed at guys who get angry about penis size anyway too much talk about genitals for today
SubredditDrama,removed,please dont make dumb jokes about islam fuckinng loser sjw sjw im offended how dare you humor is the ultimate medium dae muslims are bad fuckin librul looks like reddit is in full swing today
SubredditDrama,removed,mins isnt much foreplay it sucks that many of the men youve dated dont care if they hurt you or about you enjoying yourself to reiterate im not saying that everything fits just that more is possible with patience and experience sex does not need to and shouldnt hurt
SubredditDrama,removed,i can tell there are a lot of muslims here because this comment section is blowing up
SubredditDrama,removed,oh shes going to jail not because of trump but congress and the fbi remind me in a few months faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,what a fucking pussy
SubredditDrama,removed,oh come on now urealsensitivejerk even you dont believe what youre saying indeed in other countries eg australia the rating was for year olds the target audience they found their real target audience the lucrative australian teen market
SubredditDrama,removed,angered is the not the right more like frustrated the reality is that most asians aka chinks do not understand or simply ignore the facts about our racial situation and the reality they just simply go on with their lives because it easier that way most keep their end if the bargain where you get to live a decent life but as an emasculated man with no sense of identity the problems with most asians is that they will attack other asians than facing the real problems because that is way more comfortable for them i do not advocate violence at all but to not even acknowledge the problem is just fucking suicide and also i am not just concentrating on asian women there are a whole set of issues to deal with anyways enjoy your everything is awesome👍
SubredditDrama,removed,i dismissed the entire mainstream gaming media as an entity they deserve it yeah fucking libtard sjw cucks with their articles on video games and shit
SubredditDrama,removed,i am a chink and we are stupid errrrrr duhhhhhhhh thank u white man for reminding me how i unrury and fucked up thank you does a kowtow and runs away
SubredditDrama,removed,is it a surprise that gamergater mras are trump voters
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont want to hurt the clintons i really dont she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways literally fucking donald trump you embarrassing teenager
SubredditDrama,removed,hey faggot can i have you negroid sub you arent using it
SubredditDrama,removed,nothing more hilarious than your okcupid profile
SubredditDrama,removed,says a rthedonald trumpette brigader
SubredditDrama,removed,hard to keep up with these concepts youll see someday
SubredditDrama,removed,dont agree with the response but it probably has to do with the guy having an asian wife and therefore possibly one day having a mixedasian child so now the question is will this mixedasian child grow up under a healthy environment if daddys laughing at chink dicks and mommys enabling him apparently eurasiantiger does not believe so
SubredditDrama,removed,ill be there with the crowd of patriots youll be sitting on your fat ass ignorant to the tyranny around you
SubredditDrama,removed,you support trump yes i therefore find you to be an awful person and im not even american go figure
SubredditDrama,removed,this is a fun read
SubredditDrama,removed,shillary cunton supporters should kill themselves
SubredditDrama,removed,a lot of these same people were totally fine when jian ghomeshi was acquitted and then lauded how well the law worked a lot even conceded that he was probably guilty but the prosecutors failed god i hate were not sexist reddit why am i still here
SubredditDrama,removed,are you literally
SubredditDrama,removed,antisjws act more like stereotypical sjws than actual sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah we never hear men go on and on and on about having sex on reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,

SubredditDrama,removed,that subreddit is composed of mostly white kids laughing at black people of course they are not gonna be super mature especially when it comes to laughing at themselves
SubredditDrama,removed,posted by an ex muslim fuck off with this islam hate you shit
SubredditDrama,removed,anything to do with female representation triggers the shit out of nerds and i love it
SubredditDrama,removed,i cook you fucking monkey and im goddamn good at it
SubredditDrama,removed,i thought captain america and spiderman have been black before
SubredditDrama,removed,holy fuck leave your basement
SubredditDrama,removed,see also autistic sjw liberal reactionary etc
SubredditDrama,removed,haes is health not healthy at every size it wasis promoted by doctors and medical professionals and its doesnt mean youre healthy no matter what weight you are but it used by a plethora of very obese people to excuse their obesity
SubredditDrama,removed,the first rule of the internet should be something like always assume a person is lying or trolling but never assume that they can not be serious so while hes likely a troll there are people who do think like that
SubredditDrama,removed,it definitely is im not saying a lot of people do it but it definitely happens
SubredditDrama,removed,it is but i agree
SubredditDrama,removed,i have no problem questioning whether haes as a concept and a movement is not living up to its idealized standards when someone like ragen chastain receives frequent approval from linda bacon and has been paid to speak at official haes events by lucy aphramor criticizing haes practices and haes proponents does not mean you are part of a toxic waste dump of people who wish they were on fph i am sure our friend ufarrowss will be along shortly with a list of cherry picked low rated comments from the bowels of huge fatlogic posts to prove it is a despicable hate sub though
SubredditDrama,removed,haha grow a thicker skin
SubredditDrama,removed,again youre reducing it to being a jackass the guy is a trump supporter a racist and probably a white supremacist too youre not on my side if you still believe he doesnt deserve shitty things to happen to him if i cant reach him i hope something else does
SubredditDrama,removed,youre just concern trolling someone made a glib comment and youre a acting like its a spear thrust through your heart
SubredditDrama,removed,the people unsympathetic to nazis are the real nazis are you listening to yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,are pitbull owners ok ive honestly never met a mean pitbull ive met mean dogs of all kinds but not a pitbull
SubredditDrama,removed,hahaha yes i think empathy is a joke thats the obvious take away you totally nailed me wow good concern
SubredditDrama,removed,so do you consider white supremacists human beings too considering thats what theyd do to people they deem inferior if they could
SubredditDrama,removed,hes just telling it like it is fuck off with your pc bs
SubredditDrama,removed,how many times are you going to keep repeating that lie until you get bored of it
SubredditDrama,removed,the fact anita sarkisian has a convicted pedophile working for her that srhbutts admitted to being a pedophile themselves
SubredditDrama,removed,are you bragging about being a white knight the fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,really people schedule being medically induced all the time for medical reasons not because of their jobs i like how after he got called out he starts with oh but my wife is a trained blah blah blah sure she is mate
SubredditDrama,removed,dae wanna bring up race for no actual reason whatsoever rsubredditdrama
SubredditDrama,removed,wow looks like its actually trueat least you know youre pathetic i guess thats something
SubredditDrama,removed,except there is a clear difference youre just too stupid to see it
SubredditDrama,removed,reeeeeeeee
SubredditDrama,removed,i really started liking narcos the first few episodes but it did not go where i wanted it to go i thought there would be a lot more focus on pablo escobar and a lot of violence i wanted it to be more like a documentary instead of all these irrelevant side stories and even make me scared of pablo
SubredditDrama,removed,im so sorry i didnt realize you were retarded 😦
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah i get some people just have their own opinion but i dont understand what the fascination with it is the cringy dialogue between the kids the unnecessary teen sex life and the too unrealistic monsters but thats just me
SubredditDrama,removed,i wouldnt torture people like that id put them to sleep its less of a hassle and torture is ethically muddy i dont like it but if something happened to them like addiction or being run over several times i wouldnt care the opposite actually
SubredditDrama,removed,youre efamous for a reason
SubredditDrama,removed,are you retarded guy i was talking about isnt asian but making blanket statements about how asians dont like black people hes not saying theres racism in asian communities the guy pulls this shit here all the time but sure youre not a disingenuous dickhead
SubredditDrama,removed,she in her twenties repeatedly shared child pornography on irc including pictures of her own family member in reaction to this people on your side of this sent pictures of a child to her dont even fucking start this shit this weird pedo apologism you guys are doing is super fucking creepy
SubredditDrama,removed,which part the leaks are up on ed for all to see at this point which features her sharing some cp i could link you to that the specifics of what was in the cp i cant help you with youll have to ask dan olson whom you seem to admire for some actual child porn content hed know seeing as he apparently fucking has some available to post
SubredditDrama,removed,talking to you is like talking to a politically correct wall
SubredditDrama,removed,exactly you said what i wanted to say
SubredditDrama,removed,which is why ill celebrate when you eventually off yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,if you wanna vote hillary you do not deserve to live in this country
SubredditDrama,removed,leave theres nothing stopping you move to venezuela
SubredditDrama,removed,oh good i hope we nuke you wherever you are when donald j trump is president
SubredditDrama,removed,reading these comments its depressing to me that so many people have bought into the idea that your job is your life and you owe your employers an uninterrupted commitment to serving them with no reasonable expectation of accommodations in return having a child is a lifealtering lifeaffirming powerful human experience that merits some basic consideration delaying a start date of a job by a few weeks or months is irrelevant in the grand scheme presumably this university has been functioning without this person up until this point and will continue to function after she quits retires or dies and some kind of accommodation can be made while she has one of the most important and transformative experiences of her life
SubredditDrama,removed,thats objectively false firstly she was in her teens you are objectively bad at math nyberg was born in secondly she never shared any child pornography yeah the leak says otherwise while youve got nothing but she says it wasnt porn
SubredditDrama,removed,hopefully youll subject yourself to psychological study so we can understand your unique brain functioning yup angry black faggot who doesnt put up with bullshit and halfway thoughts of redditors
SubredditDrama,removed,can you please stop brigading threads critical of ghazi youre making the entire ghazi community look bad
SubredditDrama,removed,imo theres a distinct difference between im voting for trump and fuckin niggers is there though
SubredditDrama,removed,for which part the leaks are freely available on ed megaco and various other parts of the internet and theyre dated from and up if you want proof of her linking to child porn it happens the of july the logs are freely available
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit doesnt accept ed links which youre well aware of and you wouldnt download anything i linked you to on mega i imagine
SubredditDrama,removed,can you stop trying to defend child porn for like a second or two
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont have a main account i would love to talk shit but ghazi mods are super quick to ban and mute anybody that disagrees with them including you what lies are you referring to
SubredditDrama,removed,urgh that rmovies thread gets vile theres people in there seriously trying to argue that the japanese are the most selfhating people in the world one guys saying that china should nuke them off the face of the earth but no of course none of this has anything to do with race
SubredditDrama,removed,i think this story implausible oh so youre saying all rape claims are false no just that this one seems unlikely you are hilarious even more hilarious because according to your comment history you are a virgin why are so many progressive male feminists losers that never managed to attract a woman

SubredditDrama,removed,this emotional titles elicit a better response plus i mean fake news worked super well for trumps campaign so its going to continue to work well on reddit submit a random study about something call it a study saying that some race is inherently something and youll get upvoted
SubredditDrama,removed,milk is acidic your body balances out excess acidity by balancing it out with something base your body has calcium there have been studies showing things like milk increasing risks of bone fractures so common wisdom is being questioned here calcium is still recommended for strong bones its just being questioned if milk is helpful as a source of calcium or if you should be getting calcium from plants and such
SubredditDrama,removed,rcurvy is just a bunch of disgusting fat chicks anyway
SubredditDrama,removed,everyone is uspez but you
SubredditDrama,removed,im sure this connects to pizzagate somehow
SubredditDrama,removed,i shall find a way to power my raspberry pi
SubredditDrama,removed,its not a question of whether this thread will descend into a circlejerk but exactly how deep and in which direction itll go will we see the hilarious the only way you can vote for trump is because youre racist route a debate about what isnt and isnt fascism while people scramble wildly to justify comparing trump to hitler if saying what women will let you do if youre powerful is admitting sexual assault or not or my favorite does shaking your head at stupid criticism of trump mean youre a crypto trump supporter
SubredditDrama,removed,i think the mods of rimgoingtohellforthis making the sub into a confession sub leading up to the election was pretty great
SubredditDrama,removed,ephebophilia is not pedophilia is like all lives matter youre not objectively wrong on your high horse of textbook definitions but disingenuously ignoring social context makes you an asshole and a sperg

SubredditDrama,removed,biased news outlets such as cnn huffpo and msnbc have pushed the racistxenophobicistphobic rhetoric against him by what playing clips of the cheeto turd actually saying racist xenophobic and sexist things
SubredditDrama,removed,i came from the rdrama thread to tell you that looking at uhobbescalvinandlockes last page of history before today he was active hours ago in rnba rdrama and rconspiracy lol athough he was making fun of conspiracy theorists its still lol before that he was active seven days ago in rdrama rsports and you guessed it rsubredditdrama and rconspiracy fucking lol explain yourself hcl so im gonna weigh in and say he posts here enough that its acceptable overruled
SubredditDrama,removed,trump voter here ama u mad lib cucks
SubredditDrama,removed,those subs ban way too easily riama requires some sort of proof no idea what that would be for being a paedophile rcasualiama specifically forbids anything that has to do with paedophilia that isnt solely negative got any better suggestions
SubredditDrama,removed,haha youre an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,im blaming you specifically stop being stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,it wasnt a compliment but ok lol
SubredditDrama,removed,im dancing around the fact that youre being a shitheaded ableist referring to people as retarded who clearly arent apparently youre not bright enough yourself to get it
SubredditDrama,removed,i fully support your right to like and dislike whoever you please i can relate wanting to maintain cultural purity frankly i think its a more noble cause than conforming to the current majority consensus which is humanity at all costs by bringing these people into our nations we are conceding a small portion of our power to foreign cultures where is the logic in that or are we purely thinking with our hearts and not our heads africa is an enormous continent it would be cheaper to sponsor these people where they live then bring them into our nations the people who support this mass migration act as though these illegal immigrants can be integrated into our societies that is impossible they are muslims and they will never adopt a western perspective they have clearly demonstrated they have no respect for our laws and customs why should we take them in just look at the average iq in africa explain to me how they could be anything more than a tremendous burden which the majority will have the bear all of this after europe has essentially been disarmed its a nightmare so do any of you have anything other than insults to throw around any logic in your stance
SubredditDrama,removed,lol can you get anymore self congratulatory by comparing spamming an online complaint hotline with standing up to the nazis
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,thats the dumbest thing ive read today including explanations of how trumps grab her by the pussy comments are just biotroofs such a banner day for stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think anyone is offended by an honest depiction of racism someone in that thread gave an example of how tom and jerry also has a warning like this that imo is different of course it shouldnt be wiped from the face of the earth i should be preserved inits original state but i see nothing wrong in taking out messed up bits if theyre being broadcast for children children will probably laugh at tom mammy owner or how black people are drawn like monkeys in a looney tunes cartoon or how a gap toothed black centaur is wiping the hooves of blonde ones in fantasia whats wrong with not wanting to expose them to it explaining why its wrong to laugh at black people after theyve watched it most probably wont work just doing that wont make us forget history thats a pretty ridiculous thing for many people to say also most controversy around this comes from the anti sjws so i dont know why people are complaining about pc culture
SubredditDrama,removed,thank god the poles irish and italians have never been treated like shit in america suck a long stinky hairy cock
SubredditDrama,removed,the question here is why are you an immigrant what made you want to not live next to people like you
SubredditDrama,removed,protest because there is an apparent trend of black men being killed without due process and with impunity whiny sjws argue against the alienation of transgender or other lgbtq people tumblrina make my internet go kind of slow when im trying to look at anime porn first they came for
SubredditDrama,removed,it isnt right for one race to invade and colonize another when they have no history their just on the basis of cultutal superiority anglophone people have traditionally been opressed think of english speaking south africans and irish people or scottish people being the lowest status people in american society in the south
SubredditDrama,removed,its called latent misogyny
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah this isnt true maybe some native americans somewhere didnt care when asked wouldnt be surprised if it were a poll of selfidentifying natives but you cant say all native americans are fine with it consider theyre some of the ones trying to change it most vehemently your stupid is showing
SubredditDrama,removed,is that a rosie odonnell reference
SubredditDrama,removed,why are all the news subreddits flooded with deplorables
SubredditDrama,removed,consensual how its all talk i dont believe men need consent to talk about women no matter how vulgar not to mention trumps fantasies may as well have been consensual too but anywho not to take a boys will be boys approach but we know straight men are naturally predilected and primed for rape violence and sex so its no surprise they talk about those things
SubredditDrama,removed,damn ustevedry really brought down the hammer best put down ive read in a while
SubredditDrama,removed,no no you see the neonazi scumbag bikers just like the rest of us have the right of free speech and liberty and democracy and free speech and on another note does anybody else think we should build death camps for the sjws

SubredditDrama,removed,no youre being obtuse but whatever theres clearly nothing more to be gained from this conversation you clearly think its okay for someone to force unwanted sexual attention on people and that an ignore function that lets you not deal with it is too much censorship or whatever you are not really following the conversation this is the real conversation entrepreneur and activist cindy gallop likened it to twitters trolling problem men in tech vr dont make the mistake twitter did design this shit out right now she tweeted the men that make these games genuinely dont seem to understand that its sexual assault game developer brianna wu told cnnmoney women barely work on these teams so theres no voice of conscience wu cited playstation vrs dead or alive xtreme as an example the game lets users grope a bikiniclad virtual woman who is protesting glorifying sexual assault twitter always had a block button but that is not good enough for socjus dead or alive xtreme is not even a real person still not good enough for socjus what they want is more people employed with the nascent vr industry so they can latch on and make money see the real problem is not ignore or block or a safety zone the real problem is not hiring gender studies majors
SubredditDrama,removed,pieces of shit like you really make me hope for a civil war

SubredditDrama,removed,you are actually delusional
SubredditDrama,removed,the admins dragged their feet on banning or quarantining subs that were much less popular and way more offensive than thetinyhandsmemefactory which is more about middle schoollevel edgelording and circlejerky reality avoidance than anything truly nefarious the fact that the sub hasnt been banned has nothing to do with whether spez is voting for trump or not
SubredditDrama,removed,you got crucified for being a complete and utter twat and refusing to accept someones personal preferences
SubredditDrama,removed,i always find it humorous how you people always try to make yourselves out to be the victim in these situations

SubredditDrama,removed,ohhhhhhhhh so reddit neutral gotcha lol
SubredditDrama,removed,they dont get that there is a huge difference its reddit and anytime someone says women deserve to have equal pay and equal rights every year old in the world shows up to scream about how men are treated unfairly in society and women in the west have it good and gee false rape accusations and child support are literally life ending traumatic horrors i may or may not be speaking in hyperbole

SubredditDrama,removed,these are people who point to her hoop earrings as evidence of how crazy she is the less said about the jewkeesian characterisations the better but basically this is the level of maturity and intellect we are dealing with
SubredditDrama,removed,umidrangehell
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know if you noticed but the demographics of reddit have shifted a huuuge amount in the past years go to any rnews post where a black person commits a crime the racism just wasnt there back in the day well at least it used to be downvoted to the bottom

SubredditDrama,removed,gamers omg they are changing our games muh freeze peaches
SubredditDrama,removed,dont you think its interesting though your actual first reaction was nothing to do with what i posted it was nothing to do with whether you thought it was right or wrong or your own opinions on the matter it was solely lets dig and see what we can find out about this person presumably to use as ammunition for personal attacks why also jennifer lawrence is problematic
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a fucking idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off if i want dull conservative falsely cordial conversations i dont go to reddit for it go police someone elses word choices someone who gives a shit also snotbowst youre a pussy for reporting me and i would imagine you got beat up a lot in high school and rightly so
SubredditDrama,removed,i wish people like this were stupid enough to say the disgusting shit they say away from a keyboard he deserves the immediate concussion hed get
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe its me but sometimes it feels that these people are only angry because its a woman i honestly believe that if it had been a dad instead of a mom there would have already been a gofundme page being passed around with a few thousand dollars in it
SubredditDrama,removed,mmmm must of stung for you when hillary clinton raped bernie right before your eyes like the little puny democratic socialist bitch that he is
SubredditDrama,removed,lots of people took part in the civil rights movement hell marched for civil rights so was hillary by the way bernie didnt have to attack anybody because he had his followers doing it for him political correctness is a form of cultural marxism and must be quashed along with the belief that giving everyone free everything will solve the worlds problems hillary is about equality of opportunity and not about giving millennial babies their bottles
SubredditDrama,removed,kinda sad the propaganda germans are taught youre welcome for not allowing russia to rape your country

SubredditDrama,removed,umilkeylikesit i have done it time and time again all it takes is upvotingremoving the upvote to help with the order and some page refreshs maybe take it in that if you leave your echo chambers you will realize some people like trump
SubredditDrama,removed,but thats not a safe enough space
SubredditDrama,removed,wow you sound very reasonable just another typical clinton bully go educate yourself on some facts and get some positive communication tactics you absolute dolt
SubredditDrama,removed,people genuinely like donald teh all bots reeeeeeeeee
SubredditDrama,removed,let me try to explain this to you like an adult mr shit for brains if trump is dominating rall it would be because thats what the majority of people are on reddit to see this is blatant fucking censorship caused by political investments and selling out to global entities giving renoughtrumpspam priority is the epitome of promoting actual shit posts with shit content so your argument is ridiculous youre close to the border of brainwashed if your hatred for donald trump blinds you to the point where you lose logical sense moron
SubredditDrama,removed,these dumbasses have learned to breath with their heads in the sand no point
SubredditDrama,removed,so many racist misogynist homophobic islamaphobic bots
SubredditDrama,removed,you are so low energy that imagine that everyone else must be like you sad

SubredditDrama,removed,wow the users of this sub are severely autistic
SubredditDrama,removed,its not censorship its spam filtering
SubredditDrama,removed,the admins evidently were pissed that uvelostodon identified the real reason for the glitch and threatened mods at rthedonald to remove his post
SubredditDrama,removed,seriously though its well known even proclaimed that upvotes are worth different ammounts in different subs becaus the admins are biased and money hungry reddit is not an equal platform what happened is most likely an underflow bug in the algorithm designed to keep the rthedonald posts lower and make it harder for them to get important content to the front page so that uspez doesnt get killed by good ol murder bitch basically somebody tried cranking up the algorithm to make sure rthe donald never touched the front page again and over did it so badly that they were being algorithmed up to the top because it seems posts can only receive a limited number of up or downvotes when you exceed the maximum number of votes in either direction you will loop back to the other side in a system with no negative numbers a negative number will be translated as the maximum value plus one of the negative number this is how a bunch of item glitches in the pokemon games worked this happening is basically proof that the reddit voting system is fake and gay
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck uspez

SubredditDrama,removed,can someone with an understanding of the biology being discussed here explain this anybody with an understanding of biology will not be able to explain this without engaging in extreme transmisogyny please dont look to biology for explanations perhaps just listen and trust the trans women who are enacting the emotional labour needed to educate you

SubredditDrama,removed,im a trump supporter but i do think these trump supporters are being a bit childish about things and should put a little more effort into meeting their opponents half way in discussions edit downvotes fuck off russian trds you just mad you lost the popular vote by millions
SubredditDrama,removed,you should add rlobotomy to that list if socialism is to ever work that will be the first step
SubredditDrama,removed,oh not saying that but you seem to be completely ignoring human nature so perhaps a forced lobotomy at birth will get you the automatons you need for the next glorious evolution of human sociology
SubredditDrama,removed,room for one more ill take care of the white people think they can handle spicy food but really cant angle
SubredditDrama,removed,havent been in here for a while your account is days old
SubredditDrama,removed,everyday srs becomes more and more right

SubredditDrama,removed,they destroyed an obvious star of david dogwhistle monument thats not dangerous its justice were only cleaning up the racist symbols
SubredditDrama,removed,today in pics we find out the answer to are trump supporters oblivious
SubredditDrama,removed,did you just like literally compare trans folk to dogs
SubredditDrama,removed,trump supporters want to be oppressed and persecuted so fucking bad yet they are so incredibly thin skinned that i dont think they could actually survive being an oppressed minority if the absolutely worst thing i ever had to deal with was being called deplorable while holding bigoted views that would be great meanwhile they get called deplorable and break down crying about it
SubredditDrama,removed,i never thought i would see something uglier and more retarded than your moms face until i saw this starw man

SubredditDrama,removed,sorry about that now go fuck yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,remind me again what the difference is between this sub and rshitredditsays
SubredditDrama,removed,everyone understands what you said for fucks sake theyre annoyed with your callous and dismissive attitude towards the issue while attempting to remove context from the matter
SubredditDrama,removed,why havent the admins banned all these fucking altright subs yet it doesnt matter if youre just trolling bigotry is never funny
SubredditDrama,removed,white people are simply incapable of admitting their ancestors were shitty people
SubredditDrama,removed,ah yes the jewish yearning for the homeland that has been a part of jewish identity for millennia what an insidious agenda
SubredditDrama,removed,why do liberals hate freedom of speech so much please commit suicide so theres no chance of you continuing to pollute the gene pool
SubredditDrama,removed,my guess is because it makes the frenzied person feel like theyre being called a sexistracisthomophobe and of course being called a racist sexist or homophobe is far worse than actual racism sexism or homophobia
SubredditDrama,removed,targeting a racist space is different than targeting a race and disrupting roads is more than just an inconvenience when emergency vehicles use it too its criminal endangerment at the least learn to use your right to protest without violating the rights of others like a fool this guilty by association with us or against us mentality is horseshit im not responsible for letting something happen i have nothing to do with anymore than you are
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah but shouldnt the point of a protest be to make your message heard inform people and sway them to your cause rather than say annoy a bunch of people violate their right to an education theyre paying for and instigating tension with bystanders
SubredditDrama,removed,well just wait to deal with it until after million innocents have been slaughtered that sounds like a rational course of action
SubredditDrama,removed,theres a pool out about whether silvertongue is a reallife person who actually believes the things they keep posting about or whether theyre an epiclevel troll who has never broken character

SubredditDrama,removed,yeah people on reddit are extremely stupid

SubredditDrama,removed,they gave bob dylan a nobel prize a white man who thought it was appropriate to say nigger in a song you know who never had to use that word eminem and his songs are more lyrically entertaining i said it
SubredditDrama,removed,youre fucking disgusting i cant wait for the doj to charge assange with espionage and dismantle wikileaks for good transparency is not a good thing and no one should be defending assange or wikileaks

SubredditDrama,removed,lol you guys are worse than rpolitics when it comes to this stuff a bunch of people even more smugly hand waving away anything negative about clinton while laughably calling rthedonald an echo chamber without realizing the ridiculousness of that statement i didnt think it was possible but i think i found a group of people more smug and up their own asses than the myopic fucks over at rpolitics fascinating

SubredditDrama,removed,naw just insinuating that youll give sexual favors for a modship carry on
SubredditDrama,removed,eh theyre both bad but an animal dying is better than a person dying id rather the person do a bunnycrush or puppycrush than kill a person i remember seeing a video on liveleak where they stomp a puppy for mins unfortunately it dies around the minute mark
SubredditDrama,removed,im calling you a child rapist

SubredditDrama,removed,the mod started it look at the screenshots he started it the banned the guy for being a dick back
SubredditDrama,removed,because people like ukemingmatters just want to smugly circlejerk about how awful reddit is and how pure and rightful they are of course the guy just basically said that poor people opinion about monetary policies dont count because they would benefit from it i guess lgbt people opinion about lgbt issues dont count either how can someone be this ridiculous is beyond me but i guess thats what happens if you live to be offended by a website
SubredditDrama,removed,yes like the other person you felt the need to argue with four some reason i went back into my comment history for years and lied about my profession in preparation for this stupid argument with you you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about i dont owe you anything
SubredditDrama,removed,then why did you ask for proof youre an idiot and a sexist ego claims to be a feminist because im not a guy you stupid bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,you know i can read your comment history right you repeatedly clam to be a feminist you also use a lot of cringe worthy phrases like feminist lady boner you never claimed to be a feminist i disagree you can easily look at my comment history you dumb cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,redditor black people need to stop asking for inclusion in white films they can just make their own movies if they dont like these ones nate parker okay here i made a movie about a historically significant moment thats usually overlooked redditor you divisive racist
SubredditDrama,removed,wahh wahh i have to interact with people and actually work eyeroll
SubredditDrama,removed,racist white people hate having a spotlight put on the negative outcomes of white racism
SubredditDrama,removed,funny how fragile white egos get when race and privilege are the topics of discussion its like lots wife arguing in the comment sections
SubredditDrama,removed,i though these types liked revenge porn how are they not super excited to see a bunch of slavers getting righteously executed oh wait these are the people who identified with in years a slave that video never gets old
SubredditDrama,removed,nah i hate racism and white people because that totally makes sense
SubredditDrama,removed,is dear white people good ive been thinking about watching dope was different and not as good as i was hoping it would be
SubredditDrama,removed,im sure one already exists
SubredditDrama,removed,same exact feeling i had
SubredditDrama,removed,i cant be a smart ass to some racist
SubredditDrama,removed,seriously dude is being racist but god forbid i be a smartass
SubredditDrama,removed,ya if black americans want us to still feel guilty about slavery i hope they feel the same about the africans that sold them into it
SubredditDrama,removed,okay you gonna give the racist guy a warning too
SubredditDrama,removed,lol what a little crybaby bitch i guarantee you hes either or has a developmental disorder
SubredditDrama,removed,for people who want to see deleted comments in kebab thread
SubredditDrama,removed,reparations how much should we give them and what are the requirements who pays for it
SubredditDrama,removed,youre probably a cunt for banning people for posting in other subs youre definitely retarded if you believe that the mods dont have the right to do so
SubredditDrama,removed,asking questions is trolling fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,im not flinching
SubredditDrama,removed,k
SubredditDrama,removed,cept when it is mostly used to invalidate opinions of people who disagree with social justice types you mean online oh the horrors of someone suppressing your freeze peach on reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,lol you can suck my dick youre a nobody you big man you
SubredditDrama,removed,so that means no
SubredditDrama,removed,that post was so stupid though i did get gilded for making fun of them so that was cool
SubredditDrama,removed,i am calm just stupid that you people call anyone who doesnt act or think how youd like them to a troll
SubredditDrama,removed,of course thats bait to you
SubredditDrama,removed,no i didnt you misconstrued my comments open your mind and your heart and youll have a much easier time understanding others take a breath and try to approach things with less anger give that a shot and we might still end up pals
SubredditDrama,removed,lol you moutbreathers what a pathethic little sub this is
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think anyone who wasnt already a nazisympathizer actually sympathized with him
SubredditDrama,removed,just do it
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah he cant voice his opinion on that platform because he said a movie sucked and featured an unfunny cunt because shes a nigger and a woman he got kicked off twitter
SubredditDrama,removed,oh shit man thats my bad i thought you were just an average user didnt realize you were a moron who posted to td and mensrights
SubredditDrama,removed,i was thinking of circumcision you know the thing you can do to men but not women mutilate and butcher them without consent
SubredditDrama,removed,dae all conservatives are racist
SubredditDrama,removed,does the ira take personal checks
SubredditDrama,removed,there is no smugness bullshit yes there is this shit only happens when you get smug self superior europeans who want to shit all over americans and claim they have no culture and no right to call themselves irish or italian or german or whatever no sane european is going to give a shit if some american with irish ancestry wants to call themselves irish especially if they can trace their lineage back more than a single generation its only the smug europeans with a stick up their asses that really care
SubredditDrama,removed,seek anger management
SubredditDrama,removed,yes thats the exact same thing good call
SubredditDrama,removed,its a common story that you see amongst selfproclaimed racists something like i used to be against racismi was raised to treat everyone the same but then and that completely changed my view doesnt have to be black people people will use this to justify their hatred of any ethnic minority there are some askreddit threads asking racists why they are racist and theyre full of answers like this some answers are also like well black people commit the most crime and have the lowest iqs and as if racism is some sort of logical choice when you look at the characteristics of different races the moral of the story is people will trip over themselves to justify their own biases and bigotry
SubredditDrama,removed,uh no offense but it very much is a mental illness that should be cured you trannys kill yourselves in record numbers as you get older and the make up stops working we should be working to cure it at least the political correctness is disturbing scientific and biological progress and it is degeneracy there are already pedophile acceptance groups forming here and there as a society we should never stray too far from the center the more left the society goes the greater the backlash will be by the right and vice versa
SubredditDrama,removed,the only kind of pedantry you get behind is the one with twelve year old boys
SubredditDrama,removed,im frenchcolombianblack but when visiting europe and i tell someone that they want to argue that im simply american if you knew two things about france you would know that you are not french you may have some frenchs origin tho so yeah youre an american
SubredditDrama,removed,what a sorry sack of shit fits perfectly with the new administration
SubredditDrama,removed,nixon was among our greatest presidents read my upcoming book
SubredditDrama,removed,not help elect a racist rape monster
SubredditDrama,removed,if he is his typing mannerisms beliefs and namedrops are all very wellresearched
SubredditDrama,removed,i swear commies will get offended about almost everything the only things they dont get butthurt over are death camps and mass graves
SubredditDrama,removed,its funny that progressives and liberals opposing trump and his followers think that any kind of progress is going to be made by pacifist means trump and the right in europe are fascists the only way to stop fascists is with force they will use force against progressives and liberals and kill them if you do not stop them now there is no time for playing games of oh were so civilized we cant respond to violence with violence in this day and age it may of worked when human beings were decent followed religion saw black people shot by police had dogs sicked on them or hit with water hoses and felt disgusted in their stomach if you televised that footage today the majority of trumps supporters would be cheering a good would cheer a militarization campaign of chicago african minority suburbs that resulted in hundreds of deaths you have no idea what is going to be unleashed on this country you can look at colombia chile peru greece and understand what exactly is going on there will be no place for progressives liberals or anyone who opposes trump to hide when the death squads start marching the only way to stop it will be to fight back like the resistance did in france and italy there is a civil war coming and anyone who doesnt realize it is deluding themselves anyone who isnt preparing will die at the hands of the paramilitaries that are already organizing or be forced into labor camps fascism is coming to the world and you better be prepared because there is no sleeping giant america or fdr to save you or anyone fascism is rising and will take control in every state worldwide unless you resist and prepare to strike before hand there is nothing that you can do
SubredditDrama,removed,hey mods i voted in that thread come at me
SubredditDrama,removed,we need to get ustevenseagalofficial up in here to give us the analysis that matters
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah dude haha sick false equivalency i wish they would go so far as to segregate trans people and cis people so those freaks wouldnt be allowed to come to an event like gdq however they dont as much as your analogy implies so this is the best we can do
SubredditDrama,removed,right all women are evil got it

SubredditDrama,removed,between julian assange the pizzagate becoming a reallife shooting attempt and the fact that there was a rash of whitesupremacist posters using internet language race realism etc i am disquieted by the convergence of internet and real life it distresses me for two reasons one i thought we could safely dismiss this malarkey as such and two nobody that i talk to in real life seems to understand the depth of detail going into these oddball stories when the man went with the gun to comet ping pong it was covered here on canadian news as a man believed that there was child trafficking there due to a fake news story my mother said well hes nutty but clearly his intentions were good he thought hed go save the kids and the way the coverage was presented you could understand his train of thought kids trapped i heard about it online i have to go rescue them i said to her mum the story is that the leader of the alleged child trafficking is hillary fucking clinton she said they ought to have opened with that and frankly i agree absolutely no coverage of the true core of the lunacy i asked a few of my friends who are less deeplyinvolved in online platforms and the response was the same theyd heard about a gunman but nothing more than that these are welleducated wellheeled technologically literate young adults but since they dont dunk their faces into reddit drama or i guess infowars from the sincere side they are wholly unaware the heightening influence of conspiracy and bad information was never once mentioned in the broadcast except as the dismissal of fake news as a sort of vague nebulous thing on par with dermatologists hate her and now that were in discussions about assange and the leaks influence on the american election in a big meaningful way this makes me feel more concerned the influence of the internets weird corners is growing and yet most people walking around dont even know that there are these weird corners and what influence they have further still it makes me worry that there are strange influencing corners that i have absolutely no knowledge of either people making moves in global politics that are being sold to me with only minimal details youll keep me in the loop wont you srd but specific to the drama are those vote tallies not fucking loony anything criticizing him is downvoted to shit
SubredditDrama,removed,when libertarians started defending anyone with money on the grounds of capitalism

SubredditDrama,removed,assange is just a russian tool who screwed over hillary and made racists vote for the worst candidate of all time fuck him
SubredditDrama,removed,oh shut up faggots
SubredditDrama,removed,looks like a whole load of claims with evidence aside from take my word for it guys i hope u dont take everything ur told like its fact otherwise ur a pretty dumb guy
SubredditDrama,removed,are you stupid you post this link like its some sort of irrefutable evidence of claim but all it is is some random guy saying he made the claim moron
SubredditDrama,removed,in contact with the team at wikileaks not necessarily in contact with julian assange not necessarily in contact under their reddit handles and not even necessarily direct contact but instead through a third party besides even if this new link youre posted was actually evidence its not like you posted it in the first place you posted something completely different moron
SubredditDrama,removed,uhoh now im a russian shill da svidanya comrade you arent really disproving my thesis about the statement everyone i dislike is literally a russian agent with lines like that
SubredditDrama,removed,use the word shill unironically hi welcome to reddit

SubredditDrama,removed,is it ok to criticize a girl for dressing to provactively
SubredditDrama,removed,i thought it was pretty well known how toxic rfeminism is especially when it comes to feminism they suck
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe you and uunscot should get together since you both are incredibly obstinate humans who want to stick it to the man or whatever

SubredditDrama,removed,a video game not being to your taste isnt a form of victimization being tricked into buying a video game with lies is a form of victimization though saying that its the consumers fault for being dumb enough not to see through the lies of the developer is victim blaming ufoldablehuman

SubredditDrama,removed,im confused on what to think about this one should we listen and believe the female victim of assault or is this yet another case of our racist police institutions trying to string up a young black man
SubredditDrama,removed,leave to an enlightened redditeur to defend a rich white man for diddlin kiddies

SubredditDrama,removed,neither did you so quit whining like a limp wristed euro
SubredditDrama,removed,dont let thedickheads see this
SubredditDrama,removed,well i cant definitively say quite yet taking place which intends to prove that there was an intention to disenfranchise voters its end result would be the invalidation of the primary but that will not finish before november until that suit finishes i cant necessarily point towards it as proof innocent until proven guilty is definitely still a mantra we can both live by my perception is that the dnc utilized its roll as central organizer of its own primary election to ensure that any closed state election voter changing party affiliation from an independent to the democratic party would be changed or purged by any way possible its estimated that this action alone could have swung the primary of course like i said there could just be proof waiting to be uncovered as wikileaks continues to release russian propaganda i find it interesting that assanges internet access was cut yesterday dont you
SubredditDrama,removed,my username is relevant
SubredditDrama,removed,rpcmasterrace are some of the most entitled babies on reddit they hold a propirate stance and get confused when a developer doesnt release a game to their platform

SubredditDrama,removed,do you understand what its like to have to deal with male entittlement men feel as though they are entittled to attention benifits sex ect from women they will go up and talk to you even if you dont want to talk back its an extremely creepy and gross feeling and we shouldnt have to put up with it
SubredditDrama,removed,she specifically said ep was banned and the edit double made sure it is really really clear but then you arent a mod so how would you even really know and why do you act like a mod and throw around mod weight when you arent a mod and just a pissy starred user and at the time there is no way it would have been considered a willing name change or anything other than a ban i know because i was watching the events unfold live and it was hilarious
SubredditDrama,removed,httpiimgurcomzwwktdvpng
SubredditDrama,removed,ok wow you really dont get it not surprising either given your wonderful username just because you want to talk to a woman doesnt mean you should be able to if she doesnt want to talk fees uncomfortable ect ect its common fucking sense but a bunch of bro dudes posting on a sub for women dont get it
SubredditDrama,removed,muh sandy knees
SubredditDrama,removed,trust me i dont why should i youre bitter openly contemptuous towards the users of rlegaladvice and youre dumb enough to come here and be smug and vindictive about your position while your community is in a state of uproar and youre the sort of person the moderators have chosen as an ambassador to represent the best of their sub why in the nine hells would i trust you with anything
SubredditDrama,removed,i did ask pmmebeer to check the ban list though and youre right that the name was banned you dont understand what youre seeing live half the time because theres an entire behind the scenes aspect of the sub that you arent a part of im not going to tell you what or where that is but its there we all communicate outside of the sub and discuss nearly every single thing that happens as it happens apparently i had a better idea of what was going on then than you did and honestly who would want to be a part of a bunch of kids complaining on site or off site i hear enough kids whining in real life
SubredditDrama,removed,grasshoppa is zapopa well he is one of them i still maintain that zapopa is a sockpuppet used by the starred users when they want to stir up more shit
SubredditDrama,removed,get off reddit before you kill yourself or someone else
SubredditDrama,removed,prolly a fat gross regular or something shooting up
SubredditDrama,removed,nobody there was ever sane fyi its literally always been bitter unappealing people getting angry about a figment of their own imagination and circlejerking themselves into a lather over it

SubredditDrama,removed,something something male power fantasy yeah
SubredditDrama,removed,they just get super passiveaggressive and non confrontational like a bunch of fags
SubredditDrama,removed,my question is what the fuck was he planning to do to his girlfriend do what men usually do
SubredditDrama,removed,youre right i knew they were bigoted this is one of those all white people are shit posters i knew exactly what they meant dae white men but wanted to chuckle at their response
SubredditDrama,removed,so you started off by asking weird questions and when you get belligerent i stopped responding so you get even more aggressive and yet im a viciously hateful person for not responding to you
SubredditDrama,removed,i disagree thugs like this are better off as corpses no reasonable man would feel bad about doing the right thing in this situation obviously im not some monster waiting for a thug to break into my house just so i can empty a clip into it but if it happens god forbid ive neutralized threats like that before and ill gladly do it again youll understand if you ever start a family

SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,why does listen when i say men have problems by the way did i mention that feminism defective girl disposable gender masculinity male oppression circumcision false rape accusation dogwhistles
SubredditDrama,removed,utitinsector should inspect themselves because they are a tit
SubredditDrama,removed,this is my issue with the mra movement i definitely think that there are legitimate issues that disproportionately affect men and boys and they need to be looked at and dealt with higher suicide rates disproportionate jail sentencing issues surrounding divorce and custody the structure of schooling that tends to be harder on rambunctious active children more often though certainly not always boys which may lead to higher rates of diagnoses of add and adhd leading to medical interventions et cetera as a feminist when someone presents me with evidence of actual gendered issues it seems intellectually dishonest to dismiss it out of hand just because its not affecting my group and in any case as the mom to boys these issues could well affect my group but most of the mras that you see online dont seem to be doing much to actually try to address these issues instead they seem to be talking points to prove the real problem which is rrrrrrrrar feminism is bad women are bad look fellas this bad old feminist would agree you have some legitimate concerns and be pretty sympathetic if you were actually looking for nuanced solutions to these complex issues but thats not what it feels like as an example of this a while back i somehow stumbled across a post on a voice for men that was arguing that its not fair that men could face the draft hey no arguments here thats not fair and i dont think anyone should be forced to go to war without their consent but the solution wasnt we should probably get rid of the draft which i would agree with it wasnt even well women should have to get drafted too which i wouldnt want since i dont want anyone to get drafted but i would at least agree is fair no drafting women wont work because well all just get knocked up as many times as we need to to keep getting out of it or claim we have to stay home with our existing kids like thats any excuses it was ergo women should not be able to vote thehellyousay and to me that type of rhetoric just really tips their hand they dont actually care that some men might get conscripted against their will if they did they would want to get rid of the draft altogether they are just landing on an excuse to make womens lives worse too this sucks for men so lets not solve it lets just make other stuff suck for women because women bad
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont understand the mras that continually show up in rcanada they never actually do or propose anything useful they post negative stereotypes about men and then brigade the thread to rocket them to the top ensuring that they propagate further
SubredditDrama,removed,but maybe i have it wrong you do how dare people protect themselves from danger
SubredditDrama,removed,the difference is that one is the language of the oppressor and one is the language of the oppressed dae black people cant be racist because racism power prejudice i hope you realize no one is ever going to take you seriously

SubredditDrama,removed,im pretty sure op is also or at least some combination of those users similar username structure similar post length and structure though some more obviously trolling than others and even similar phrasing all new accounts created at approximately the same times and posting at the same times every sub needs at least one member with that level of knowledge and savvyness

SubredditDrama,removed,i dont care about the term because i can look past it argues for two days about why women shouldnt use it
SubredditDrama,removed,how am i mansplaining i am merely responding and explaining where i stand since were having a discussion my concern is that if you want to reach men then i think a different term would be better as i have explicitly stated before so its not my primary concern its a discussion point on communication towards men i havent told anyone they should be prioritizing it or what they should do in their own circles my primary concern is how you can effectively communicate these issues so that we can reduce them not how it affects men anyway i would love to have a serious discussion about this but your last two replies have mostly been provoking so im just going to leave it here
SubredditDrama,removed,love it
SubredditDrama,removed,ooh drama im involved in im actually kind of surprised to see this here i honestly think he has a reading disability or something which is understandable if he does but god damn that doesnt prevent him from admitting error

SubredditDrama,removed,back during the democratic primaries during the lead up to the north carolina primary an older black member of the north carolina state senate was speaking to a crowd of bernie sanders supporters he was a baptist minister about years old who has been involved with the civil rights movement for several decades at least since the when the klan would openly show up at this home and threaten to murder him he was explaining what he supports mostly it was stuff out of the sanders campaign playbook especially on issues of income inequality and college tuition needs all the kids in the audience was loving everything he was saying right up until the point when he said that those are all the same reasons he has endorsed hillary clinton for president they all went insane and started screaming at the old man but he kept on he continued to explain that hed meet both bill and hillary clinton more times than he can count hes had dinner at their homes and had them to dinner at his home hes knows them both rather well since the late they would help him raise money for his campaigns for the north carolina state senate theyd solicit his opinions on matters they know he cares about he has maintained a relationship with him for years because they have broken bread together on dozens of occasions he has had time to get to know them he knows and trusts the clintons then he mentioned that has met bernie sanders only twice in his long career both times in the immediately past year and each time for less than two minutes sanders never asked him for his opinions on anything bernie sanders just assumed that because he politically agrees with him that therefore this old black baptist minister should simply support him regardless of anything else hes known the clintons and knows that they agree with him on most things sanders agrees with him but sanders has never once attempted to actually form a real relationship with him or any his constituents so he supported hillary clinton for president what people forget is that all politics is local the clintons helped people for years a lot of socalled progressives never helped to get state senators in north carolina for decades they think that because sanders agreed with their politics that therefore people should have just automatically bestowed their votes to sanders as if sanders deserved them as if those votes were his by right but sanders never made campaign swings through southern states helping to elect black progressive democrats to office a lot of these southern states are republican held territory and its hard for the progressive democrats to win office bill and hillary clinton had been wading into those fights for years often in losing efforts but through that time they have made friends and built political relationships in short the clintons had built long term working political relationships something sanders didnt seem to appreciate or fully understand former house speaker tip oneill said people like to be asked oneill related this story in his autobiography he found out a neighbor of his hadnt voted for him so he asked her why she didnt vote for him you never asked for my vote was her response oneill always went out of his way to kindly ask people for their votes from then on now bernie sanders and his new progressives are going to have to defend the entire obama legacy everything they didnt like about obama they have now found something much worse than it trump and the republican congress are going to try and repeal obamacare at least another or times they are going to not just not close gitmo but will probably try and expand it those socalled progressives that didnt want to help hillary clinton get elected to cement the obama legacy they are now wed to the obama legacy weather they like it or not for the alternative now is far worse all a lot of us long term liberal democrats have to say to them now is told ya so

SubredditDrama,removed,or its a blatant lie that works over and over again because most people on here need a testosterone shot
SubredditDrama,removed,if people think it is fake then they should ignore it you shouldnt treat a potentially already fragile mind with negativity if you know it is already fragile people like ualphatrion and specifically clearly have limited capacity for humanity and likely have limited experience with trauma themselves or are burying it see the formers profile clusterfuck i would argue the former is likely very unloved himself they clearly have an inability to understand that people deal with death in many ways and they know that despite the fact they think it is fake they know it might not be and still decided to post a comment that is degrading to the other person and infact humans in general even if this is fake which i do not believe it is i would argue the inhumanity from those users is far more disgusting and vile than someone that wants a few internet points there are far better ways to deal with someone you think is full of shit the bottom line is if this was fake the op would be doing one shitpost is quite literally a shitpost account that was likely born out of frustration and continues to exist and i hope he gets help with both his life and moves onto different drugs that doesnt make him such an inane inhumane shithead

SubredditDrama,removed,i was raised in the most leftist of homes and it took me until i was in my thirties to see just how broken bleeding heart liberalism actually is once you see it theres no going back it only becomes more and more obvious the fabric which holds the far left together is finally tearing especially on the internet dont get me wrong the far right is just as bad somewhere in between the two is the most logical place to be
SubredditDrama,removed,because the world would be a better place if people like him either learned their lesson or were dead some people deserve to be eliminated from society guys like him are some of those people
SubredditDrama,removed,how the hell am i being edgy its a perfectly valid opinion that some people need culling red pillers for example absolutely need to be eliminated they only make the world a worse place why should we include them in our society if they only cause trouble for everyone
SubredditDrama,removed,well next time someone just has to finish the job then he can be silenced forever
SubredditDrama,removed,i do think he deserved death for what he was doing as a matter of fact him and all people like him

SubredditDrama,removed,even i find that hard to believe but itd be fucking gay if true
SubredditDrama,removed,well he was saying that it was ridiculous how umcassweed attributed reddits love of butts something very common and their strong political opinions something not unique to reddit being white men or kids i guess
SubredditDrama,removed,we sure autistic shit can try
SubredditDrama,removed,because people on reddit are all shit except us in srd of course and i have to defend them because they are women twitch is shitpost central but there is some dumb shit the streamers do

SubredditDrama,removed,i did read it i just didnt look at the date also im not sure why circumcision gets a free pass from rational thought in every srd thread and anybody who speaks up gets derided for it maybe because youre stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,suddenly white people are upset by racial violence
SubredditDrama,removed,lol seriously even ujustmikeyo admitted that he banned me because id blocked him first because he was petty receipt this was the best part of the thread imo just a quick personal insult that resulted in a drag
SubredditDrama,removed,wont someobody please think of the men
SubredditDrama,removed,i know plenty of guys who walk around in public by themselves who dont get accused of being creeps its how you carry yourself but considering youre comparing this alleged situation to racism i figure you dont get out much either
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think it has any bearing on the popcorn but the guys post history is about him talking about his doll photography i didnt know that was a niche that needed filling but as always rofcoursethatsathing
SubredditDrama,removed,the people who make excuses like saying drunk people can consent or other such excuses the kind of people who frequent trp or incels
SubredditDrama,removed,this is actually just how a lot of people think sadly im the most logical and reasonable person youre all triggered feminist sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,there it is are you seriously trying to silence me would this be called womansplaining im giving you my own personal experience and your trying to imply it doesnt count because of my race and sex seriously

SubredditDrama,removed,geez dude in my day when we had such a debilitating crush on a celebrity as you have on monroe we undertook several unpleasant trials to track down their phone numbers whereupon we called them and breathed heavily at them over the phone with the power of the internet it seems that you really can shit on everything
SubredditDrama,removed,you must be one of the ten thousand hehehe

SubredditDrama,removed,remindme hour srd in srd going to need this srd in srd juice
SubredditDrama,removed,probably that you are a creepy old dude dating his daughter
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a creepy old man trying to justify your own desires to sleep with younger women
SubredditDrama,removed,sheep
SubredditDrama,removed,rsubredditdramadrama
SubredditDrama,removed,i doubt your happiness means that much to your gf father lol anyway if youre at the maturity level where you can emotionally connect with a year old at then okie dokie
SubredditDrama,removed,the private sub youre banned from fight club asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,bitch shut the fuck up and take off your hate shades ffs just chill out
SubredditDrama,removed,oh fuck yourself you work for a big what is it oracle you piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,im only being lambasted by your shitty subreddit its okay asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,oh shit sorry punk
SubredditDrama,removed,it goes about as well as youd expect knowing reddit and the in action sphere in particular i expected the pedo to have net upvotes and have been gilded enough to keep the site going until im pleasantly surprised for once
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly i think the chinese smell worse than indians lol it must be all the dog they eat
SubredditDrama,removed,his history suggests someone really concerned with computer security and privacy like for hiding a collection of child pornography
SubredditDrama,removed,my god you were so promising well sorry for mentioning my own group if i was a muslim i might have mentioned them
SubredditDrama,removed,why should i leave a thread that is actually about me this isnt even the first time ive been posted on rsubredditdrama either
SubredditDrama,removed,almost his age preference you dont even know my age preference year olds are pretty hot how in the fuck would they be able to fully understand a sexual relationship obviously not all of them do that doesnt mean there arent some that do understand sexuality and relationships
SubredditDrama,removed,thats what people have been told so thats what theyll believe questioning the validity of the claim because rape is harmful to children all sex is harmful to children will get people to attack you and possibly to ruin your life
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know how people have usernames like slapthecuntoffherface and expect to get taken seriously
SubredditDrama,removed,that lolidaisuki guy should probably just go buy a gun and blow his brains all over the wall
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao you fucks are a piece of work go on explicitly tell me how that study is an indictment of black culture i really cant wait
SubredditDrama,removed,because theyre not a cuck beta fag like you s
SubredditDrama,removed,im certain that if this were playing out irl wed all be flooded with legal notices signed in blood by raybornert
SubredditDrama,removed,disclaimer taken from his twitter account that he posted to the farcraft sub no doxxing here
SubredditDrama,removed,you can find him on facebook very easily if you look up his name on his website
SubredditDrama,removed,stop while youre behind in what world does this make sense honestly you should just delete your account before youre put on a list if youre not already on one im already on lists however the lists are so huge that they dont really do any good you are on the list for replying at me and everyone youre talking to is on the list because they talk to you and you talked to me go to a therapist ive mentioned quite a few times already that i am seeing a therapist if we keep going on here well soon need rsubredditdramadrama
SubredditDrama,removed,christ will you fuck off already
SubredditDrama,removed,if youre trying to protect people from getting offended i find it quite silly that youd be doing it in a thread that is about paedophilia
SubredditDrama,removed,that about sums up tia honestly a bunch of pedos screeching about how asexuals on tumblr mean the world is ending
SubredditDrama,removed,so you think that black culture has an inherent problem with academic success and youre black how sad
SubredditDrama,removed,everyday i hate reddit more i didnt realise there were so many potential paedophiles on here
SubredditDrama,removed,jump off a bridge b
SubredditDrama,removed,im reminded of some gamergate website that had several pages dedicated to you guessed it cherrypicking scientific literature to prove that men are smarter than women and that somehow justifies gamergate or something ive never facepalmed as hard as i did that day
SubredditDrama,removed,please dont touch or sexually view minors in any way what exactly is wrong with sexually viewing them eyes dont hurt you will hurt then in the future and when the parents find out you will die my parents already know im attractedt to prepubscent girls they took it quite well
SubredditDrama,removed,i am not a troll
SubredditDrama,removed,why is tumblr singled out mainly by conservatives as some kind of crazy place because women use it
SubredditDrama,removed,remember guys srd totally isnt srs
SubredditDrama,removed,people go all guys we totally can sue reddit for this after every major subreddit ban with various but always idiotic reasons since kia is mentioned its probably from fph ban times either or
SubredditDrama,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,removed,please die in a fire
SubredditDrama,removed,does he realize he just successfully doxxed himself by linking to the actual trademark
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah okay dude
SubredditDrama,removed,you are insane
SubredditDrama,removed,yes oh so they werent my words i was wondering why i had a hard time remembering the all in there you turned this banned from college campuses into this banned on all college campuses usually people who are being pedantic try to at least be accurate themselves that way when you say stuff like this purposefully misrepresented misrepresent the truth it makes it a little less embarrassing on your end it was the student federation who canceled the class not university authorities additionally it wasnt a class so much as free yoga sessions offered out of the student building yeah and im finding very little evidence of universities doing the things you so desperately claim that they do im really glad you find these practices so disgusting that you instead of choosing to automatically side with these people choose to be skeptical they exist and most people are like you most people at uottawa hated this student union for what they did and they were almost universally despised but that didnt take the power away from them because its unfortunately the loud minority that makes the rules not the silent majority john oliver talked about this in his segment about gun legislation how even though of americans are in favour of common sense laws congress chooses to listen to the nras minority opinion instead because theyre louder and treat the issue as life or death
SubredditDrama,removed,rdrama isnt really the place to go if you dont like smug posting
SubredditDrama,removed,i havent watched south park in probably a decade or more and i still dread each new season because of their fucking fan base
SubredditDrama,removed,lol its not baiting when you do it though its just you setting le tone but the moment it is not in favor of white people it becomes circlebroke foh with that shit
SubredditDrama,removed,you can go literally anywhere else to repeat that ad nauseum wait this is still my reddit im on right i didnt fall through a portal and am not experiencing some mandela effect shit where actually reddit in my universe was a joyless shithole of resentmentfueled racists and sexless pillowfuckers outside of a specific segment of subs but is instead in this universe a pretty chill place where oxus is actually a pretty bangup dude right
SubredditDrama,removed,and south park fans inabilities to see the point of the fucking joke continues
SubredditDrama,removed,paging ughostofrfs
SubredditDrama,removed,that thread was biased and promoting terror muslims do not belong in the western world they are violent and their goal is to destroy canadian values anyone challenging this is supporting terror crimes fuck these politically correct puppets and morons everywhere these people cannot even think for themselves instead they take what they hear from the media as truth and nothing but the truth these are the most pathetic and destructive people on earth being politically correct has caused non stop terror crimes throughout all of europe
SubredditDrama,removed,oh video games what drama you create what makes gamers so incapable of just chilling the fuck out big surpirse awful writing is rife in a medium mostly unsuited for story telling and rpgs are the worst way to tell stories in games not to mention theres more honest maturity in an episode of scooby doo than any of the games they are discussing now wheres that video games were a mistake miyamoto meme
SubredditDrama,removed,you know uphysicsismymistress im a little disappointed in you you could be more like urobotrollcall and actually be useful to society or you could just be this loser who post stupid drama which is it going to be
SubredditDrama,removed,thats the half that is uncomfortable loaning to black people
SubredditDrama,removed,i agree a man hacking off his weiner and morphing into an unholy abomination of humanity is a fantasy right at home with other bizarre legends
SubredditDrama,removed,is thedonald just young republicans now they went from calling hillary a warmonger to fullblown fox news florida che guevara was a filthy commie reeeeeeeeee mode in weeks this is hilarious
SubredditDrama,removed,how many dicks were you seeing fam
SubredditDrama,removed,am i surprised the guy with an ax to grind over actual mutilation of women getting more attention than a legitimate medical procedure done to boys is an mra not really but that its also based on having read somewhere that its the number one cause of limp dick im just shocked that an mra anticircumcision advocate would based his opinion on halfremembered claims he cant source
SubredditDrama,removed,what an absolute horseshit post promoting male genital mutilation what is the structure function of the foreskin circumcision circumcision at the intersection of religion medicine and human rights john geisheker circumcision the whole story a historical and medical critique of circumcision dr christopher guest child circumcision an elephant in the hospital changes in infants claims of curing over time
SubredditDrama,removed,this is most ackshually post ive seen in a while
SubredditDrama,removed,i always enjoy how a huge chunk of dudes always jump to lol white knight she wont sleep with you dude without stopping to consider that just maybe once in a while thats not what the poster was going for once in a while its reddit lets not get crazy
SubredditDrama,removed,the reason most people are aware of her existence is because of her involvement with musk this would only seem plausible on reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,it pretends to be an argument about bodily autonomy while actually just being a way for both sides to let everyone know that their penis is right just the way it is but others are broken and wrong its a dick wagging contest pretending to be a human rights issue
SubredditDrama,removed,correct routine infant circumcision is misinformation and peddling bullshit what is the structure function of the foreskin circumcision circumcision at the intersection of religion medicine and human rights john geisheker circumcision the whole story a historical and medical critique of circumcision dr christopher guest child circumcision an elephant in the hospital changes in infants claims of curing over time
SubredditDrama,removed,everyones dick is fucked upreddit
SubredditDrama,removed,im trying to decide where the reddit anticircumcision circlejerk came from my current theory is that its a combination of antisjw people and the jews are evil conspiracy theorists
SubredditDrama,removed,its not anecdotal i just thought what was being said was way too sympathetic and unrealistic sounded like victim creation i just made that up i literally went to the wiki and it mirrored my own thoughts on the matter which makes me just as qualified to comment on the situation as the dickheads in that thread if my unsympathetic tone offends thats fucking tough
SubredditDrama,removed,why do you like killing children
SubredditDrama,removed,circumcision is the jews greatest give to man thank you abraham peace and blessings be upon you for circumcising your son
SubredditDrama,removed,true that i still think shits going to get dark if we elect this guy mainly because of the dangerousness of his supporters these people are legit quasi fascist creeps that at the drop of a hat would kill or maim anyone that disagrees with him
SubredditDrama,removed,i see a lot of them keep talking about getting of vote and thus federal fundingisnt that something they should be completely opposed to money gained from taxation given to other people
SubredditDrama,removed,plz click

SubredditDrama,removed,it doesnt matter how the gay person feels it does not change the reason behind the other persons dislike for them
SubredditDrama,removed,member when srd disnt brigade subreddits me neither
SubredditDrama,removed,what is anecdotal and im not really joking the hikikomoru are not victims they have noone to blame for their situation but themselves expectations does not equal locking yourself in your bedroom at moms house fuck you fuck that
SubredditDrama,removed,nah fema camps have no basis rampant bullshit social justice faggotry all over the place and only getting more outlandish
SubredditDrama,removed,it was never billed as a prequel because i listened to what ridley scott said i enjoyed the movie quite a lot because i did not expect a prequel
SubredditDrama,removed,the fact is that the best thing to do isto suit whatever the preference of women is in your country do what will make you happier stop doing things based on ethicsprincipals its so useless this will sound harsh but sometimes the harshest truth is the truest in america having no foreskin probably is going to make your life marginally easier all the women who say oh no wait foreskins are good are just virtue signaling and dont want to admit they find them gross dicks are already ugly and if doing x to it makes it prettier to women its probably a good idea to do it bbbut you shouldnt do something just for the opposite sex well that sounds nice but its so bullshit and hypocritical everyone tries to attract the opposite or prefferred sex because thats a major part of feeling satisfied in life for of peoplefeeling desired loved validated

SubredditDrama,removed,what are you even talking about dude your whole spiel about attraction sounded altrighty to begin with and using a term like virtue signaling only confirmed it especially when you posted that rambling nonsense in response to my joke comment about a pee balloon
SubredditDrama,removed,how is it fucked up to appeal to the opposite sex or at least seem less gross to the opposite sex the penis is an ugly thing to most people even women if the women in your country find a cut dick more appealing its in your best interest to do it especially if most of the other guys have a cut onethen youre at a relative disadvantage sure it shouldnt be a thing but its in your sons individual best interest to be circumcised if he lives in america dont put your son at a disadvantage as an individual just because you broadly believe the world should change most young women in the usa are disgusted by uncut dicks the ones who promote them are just trying to seem like nice fair people but attraction doesnt bend to our ethics and principles spiders look gross to most peoplethats unfair to spiders but too fucking bad we are apes that find things arbitrarily uglypretty and the day that stops mattering is the day that we all collectively gouge our eyes out bbbut you shouldnt do something just for the opposite sex well that sounds nice but its so bullshit and hypocritical everyone tries to attract the opposite or prefferred sex because thats a major part of feeling satisfied in life for of peoplefeeling desired loved validated so shut the fuck up and stop judging people for wanting to appeal to others cut up your sons dick if women prefer cut dicks stop doing what you personally think is right you fucking pretentious philosopher

SubredditDrama,removed,hey dickhead who in the fuck do you think asked the sub if anybody wanted to step up to be a mod who in the fuck do you think approved them who started this subreddit if your answer for those questions isnt uerthwerm then you need a fuckin history lesson one of my favorite parts this guy means business
SubredditDrama,removed,jesus christ the new wonder woman movie is going to be ghostbusters drama isnt it well lets check is it a superhero movie yes does it have a female lead yes looks like if fills all the requirements
SubredditDrama,removed,he is a literal nazi look at his username lol
SubredditDrama,removed,exactly no one was stunned when uohnana neglected to answer this question
SubredditDrama,removed,remember when certain gamers were outraged over certain other gamers demands of games how demanding things criticism and online campaigns were censorship shaming and the death of dev freedoms how a game being bought validated its existence because it gave gamers what they wanted i guess i wasted all that time arguing online since making demands of devs is cool after all im so glad we sorted that out for the future ¬¬
SubredditDrama,removed,does it surprise you that the hardcore virtue signalers here care more about politics than love
SubredditDrama,removed,tbf i dont think id want to fuck a trump supporter
SubredditDrama,removed,you sound like the type of person who thinks trump memes are fear mongering now that hes president
SubredditDrama,removed,lul
SubredditDrama,removed,salty as fuck hahahahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,haha yea me too i got raped by trump too was too scared to say anything tho
SubredditDrama,removed,so mad lul keep crying maybe thatll help hahahahahahahahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,did you know muslims are against everything you just stated not arguing your point but its kinda funny that you shit on one group for supposedly doing it trump supporters and sympathize with the other group that practices it heavily muslims as far as i know there hasnt been a case where conservatives have beheaded gays commited mass rape oppressed women to the point of death and killed other for not believing their beliefs
SubredditDrama,removed,and male
SubredditDrama,removed,but i thought the left was a bastion free from sexism and was for equality oh wait they only care about t women in those discussions
SubredditDrama,removed,keep at it maybe you will lose in too
SubredditDrama,removed,not all trump supporters are racists bigots yes they are lets cut through the bullshit deflections when you vote for a racist bigot it means that you personally decided that you were okay with him being a racist bigot for insert dumbass reason you accepted racism and bigotry into your life and decided to hitch your star to it i dont give a flying fuck how you justify it call it your youthful experimental racist phase all you want youre still racist
SubredditDrama,removed,oh look a donghole poster who posted is mad that women dont want to have sex with the master race
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,you seem dense we had cancer like you here in sweden when the swedish democrats took seats in the parlamemt
SubredditDrama,removed,lol trump won by solely appealing to a racial majority you imbicile
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know i shared something about successful refugees to see how the trump person on my timeline would respond and he called the man a sand nigger i actually shared it to see his hed react and he went for it
SubredditDrama,removed,these are the people that won take a good look at the next four years folks
SubredditDrama,removed,lastresortforthefeebleminded
SubredditDrama,removed,well gays are annoying
SubredditDrama,removed,which is worse someone who fund and recruits for a terrorist ideology because they believe in it or someone who funds and recruits for a terrorist ideology because they enjoy the social scene or the free falafels they get at the meetings ive never funded or supported a terrorist group in my life unfortunately not all muslim communities are lucky enough to have so much falafel we have killer klepon though if you dont know what that is you havent really lived but havent you noticed there hasnt been a single islamic reformation in years and there are no signs of one lol if he thinks islam hasnt changed split or had disagreements in years he is in for a shock
SubredditDrama,removed,no the socialists on here get verry vexxed if you talk about christianity in a postive way
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a pompous asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,it depends on the state in some its more than three in others it may not racist at all
SubredditDrama,removed,you joke haha bravo but that doesnt make any fucking sense they werent trying to discredit him they were beyond that point even then they were trying to imprison him and when it comes to that what his supporters omg theyre all neckbeards xd lol think doesnt mean shit you stupid cow
SubredditDrama,removed,how is it trolling you can call swedes vikings but i cant call you clansmen
SubredditDrama,removed,thats such a ridiculous statement that i have to think youre trolling i suppose if i could see your face and read your body language things might be different
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off that was weeks ago i dont bookmark shit go search for it yourself are you retarded or something you cant click on a search bar and then type drone and press enter it was something can we drone the guy and then people thought she was saying a joke and gave a nervous laugh and she said no seriously could we after that i remember well because in that moment i just realized retarded fucking liberals would rather vote for a war criminal that committed treason and wants to drone people over a guy who says mean things thats you and youre fucking retarded you dolt

SubredditDrama,removed,reddit in general is one of the most hateful websites out there
SubredditDrama,removed,like all the nigs who vote democrat for gibs
SubredditDrama,removed,of course not democrats are the real racists
SubredditDrama,removed,making fun of people on a lonelinessdepression board stay classy
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah wood construction is clearly the way of the future look at all of those skyscrapers made entirely without cmus
SubredditDrama,removed,im gonna throw a at you mostly because i am very curious about what kind of insane half baked wordpress site style bullshit you come up with
SubredditDrama,removed,while you ponder the history of this i must regrettably inform you that i am in fact a demons
SubredditDrama,removed,the only news outlet regularly reporting on her wasis gawker and even they mocked her
SubredditDrama,removed,let me clarify what i meant is i recall gawker reporting on it as it usually would do on all thing new york and i used to discuss it on gawker where it was a general consensus that shes just a fraud im talking period between and when i lived in nyc few block from moma now you find me a thread on reddit where her work is discussed id love to see that
SubredditDrama,removed,my favorite thing about you conspiracy theorists is that youre still focused on the masons being some super secretive society even after theyve been advertising on radio for new members for years generally shadow governments dont need to resort to recruitment drives
SubredditDrama,removed,we must have read different papers it said of babies were born with so much lead in them that they were already at the intervention level those interventions levels due to industry bias and associated widespread healthcare costs are usually artificially high so if it was my kid id want them well under that intervention level
SubredditDrama,removed,this is just your typical day in raskmen a bunch of young dudes trying to find something to nail women to the wall for
SubredditDrama,removed,raskmen is so gross lmaooo eww eww eww
SubredditDrama,removed,the comment is more cringe than anything the mod is a male feminist
SubredditDrama,removed,if they stop ingesting lead it is out of your system in days no need for homemade chelation only with children is it an issue since the lead bonds to their growth plates and stays there for life
SubredditDrama,removed,srd banned soapboxing in the comments so people have to find a way around that to get their complaints about reddit users being all stupid horny republican teenagers in another way
SubredditDrama,removed,yea jokes are evil
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah it wouldnt make sense if you attribute a single grain of salt with evidence thats why the grain of salt has never been attributed as evidence in the metaphor
SubredditDrama,removed,i like how all ctr shills give themselves away do easily by all saying td
SubredditDrama,removed,theres a lot of evil involved with freemasonry and other activities people engage in do you know what freemasons do they wear white aprons sit in a little room and talk about local initiatives they can raise funds for grammy beppy from carlton needs a new driveway type of shit hell evil believing in god is one of the few hard requirements for joining heaven save us
SubredditDrama,removed,anita is a perfect case study of bad scholarship in general it does suck that shes a face of feminism for so many because she sucks i dont care if she has a postgraduate degree she is a shitty scholar and uses the same shitty methodology that all bad academics make what is that methodology cherry picking she has no regard for context which is funny since academic feminism is all over context the shame is that there seem to be a lot of shitty womens studies programs with shitty teachers where this shitty methodology is encouraged and the kicker you dont need to cherry pick to show that games tend to have a sex problem but you do need cherry pick if you want to suggest that games arent trying to move forward tldr not a fan
SubredditDrama,removed,ironic that a sub with the world anarchy in its name is as reactionary as you can get
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah but did you read what he wrote

SubredditDrama,removed,my god those comments its just its that i ugh i cant even right now what is the deal here it seems like twox is full of angry men hating women rather than a sub for women to discuss womens perspectives does anyone else agree

SubredditDrama,removed,hahaha this dude cant be real this shit is classic hahaha remember that dumbass with years service being discharged here he is on reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,god amy schumer is a rapist
SubredditDrama,removed,frankly i think those who will be responsible for the upcoming oppression and purges of minorities deserve to be exposed these next few years are going to be comparable to the treachery of nazi germany this is public information and greater than that this is justice notice their screaming hissing spitting skittering and spewing once theyve realized theyve been exposed for what they are they cant stand it it makes their heart twitch seize crack their pale skin dries boils and peels their eyes shrink and shiver theyve been found out they cant have that can they i find it very interesting and amusing theyre cowards plain and simple that will be their eventual ruin
SubredditDrama,removed,is he an engineer everything ive seen points to him being an ideas guys with enough money to pay actual engineers to try to build his shit
SubredditDrama,removed,dumb chink
SubredditDrama,removed,i see no evidence on wikipedia that he has ever personally engineered anything of significance that said i dont care that much and only looked for twenty seconds
SubredditDrama,removed,so ban td because its so popular or do you want to ban it because you disagree with what they say funny i hear no cry to remove the pedo subs or incest subs or the rape subs i can go on and on you fucking people are a disgrace
SubredditDrama,removed,here you go hopefully your ignorant ass out it doesnt really do any good to play dumb as if youve never heard the man talk were talking about the candidate who started his campaign claiming that mexican immigrants are mostly criminals drug dealers and rapists oh but he assumes that some are good people so i guess thats a perfectly reasonable thing to say right
SubredditDrama,removed,yet they can call me ignorant twice in one comment and not a peep about their behavior because you and i dont share the same world views youd rather i keep my opinion to myself i see the double standard is as prominent as ever in the liberal groupthink safe spaces as always i will gladly leave since it appears my reciting facts about presidentelect trump compared to their emotionallycharged hateful rhetoric has summoned a moderator to shut my perspective on things down sometimes i forget that the thought police is alive and well outside of a few subreddits on this site
SubredditDrama,removed,im a default mod and have access to the same slack chat this is funny considering how fucking hard he was back peddling when it happened how does it feel your time is now over on reddit weve all seen what kind of sick people you are
SubredditDrama,removed,side note men get told they suck women get threatened with rape thats not mentioned anywhere in the source i noted either back you points up or remain quiet im not surprised by the downvotes this sjw infected sub hates anything even remotely resembling actual facts and data women just need to git gud
SubredditDrama,removed,perhaps you also need a therapy dog to help you cope
SubredditDrama,removed,remember when you got fired from reddit and you lost your lawsuit and gamergate started and then trump took over power in america because people like you are fucking bullshit
SubredditDrama,removed,nah if you single them out for harassment or intimidation thats not kosher thats not what this is though so what is tweeting names professions and locations of random trump donors you have looked at httpstwittercomeverytrumpdonor havent you i dont understand why you people think that im being sarcastic and am trying to trap you and so try to disagree with me about trivially true things as a tactic that shit is not different from printing a list of known jews and jewsympathizers and tacking some copies to the walls in your neighborhood grass is green water is wet this is intimidation through random singling out but everytrumpdonors not fascism because fascisms goal is to intimidate and oppress minorities while everytrumpdonors goal is to intimidate bigots so thats basically a polar opposite and completely ok so why are you arguing im using logic and reason to demonstrate how youre right please keep justifying and encouraging that sort of political activism im agreeing with you here
SubredditDrama,removed,lol damn it you beat me to posting this thread was just locked before i could call op out for his cuckery what a sore vagina

SubredditDrama,removed,i hope all those poor working class white men lose their jobs see their families starve and die of an opioid overdose like every redneck hillbilly does these days only then will america be able to begin to grow when flyover country is nothing else but a cementary
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,they are misogynists they are racists and if they arent their culture and ancestors certainly were they dont deserve to be treated like adults
SubredditDrama,removed,those fucking rural americans have blood in their hands for generations now the young ones are yearning to relive the good ol days of lynching blacks and homosexuals thats what they vote for fuck the sympathetic representations of them they voted hatred thats it they know they are on their way out so their only hope was to take as many real human beings with them as possible
SubredditDrama,removed,i just watched a video created by a muslim man in which a year old girl is suspended upside down over a toilet while a year old girl pisses on the childs face and into her mouth the two of them then waterboard the child the older girl is then assfucked by the man i dont want to live on this planet anymore i hate all people especially all pedophiles and all the islamic immigrants who say this comes from allah these are the sort of piece of shit racist white scumbags who voted trump people who think that other cultures are to blame for worlds problems people who think a bunch of cells are enough to be called life people who think black people are inferior beings having a meltdown seeing this happen is the right course of action
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah probably gonna kill myself soon have fun guys
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,the only thing that brights my day today is that they are on their way out they are dying out they are losing their jobs they are starving they are oding on opioids they may not be here to vote for a reelection i see an america with a white minority reaping the harvest of oppression and hatred after all these years and thats what brights my day today
SubredditDrama,removed,if hes aive
SubredditDrama,removed,we all know why they voted trump dont try to justify them and make excuses for them
SubredditDrama,removed,your lack of intelligence is really shining through here way to generalise because youre butthurt
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao honey i live in the deep south and have been called a faggot all my life walk with a swish to my hips and paint my damn nails these overdramatic queens will caterwaul over anything like hell if a trump presidency changes anything about how people feel towards gays
SubredditDrama,removed,no dumbass cant you read and interpret or maybe youre trying to intentionally misquote me either way what i said is that you cant call someone racist for voting for trump its as simple as that you just cant voting for a candidate being racist you can be against said candidate concerning some measures and still vote for him because you disagree even more with the other candidate that doesnt make you a racist even if the candidate youre voting for is which trump isnt stop trying to pass the notion that the democratic leftist vote is the morally superior vote youre not better than anyone just because you vote democrat and no ones worse than you for voting republican this idea that the right represents evil and the left represents good needs to die really really fast
SubredditDrama,removed,cry more
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao i cant wait for this cuck to die
SubredditDrama,removed,can you like fuck your own mother and then let her be raped by a dead dog
SubredditDrama,removed,this he needs to die of cancer already
SubredditDrama,removed,umad
SubredditDrama,removed,melt bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,its simple because he pandered to the racist homophobic transphobic misogynistic illiterate inbred lower class white people the same people who america has got to get rid off for once and for all instead of sympathizing with their socalled struggles
SubredditDrama,removed,rgaybros is a cesspool of racism misogyny internalized homophobia and other dumb shit that the absolutely bottom of the barrel gays participate in
SubredditDrama,removed,why not everyone agrees that homosexuality is acceptable there was even an ama a couple years ago from a man who has completed conversion therapy and he came out happier and healthier take the fear mongering in the news with a big grain of salt
SubredditDrama,removed,large gatherings of white males are inevitably toxic
SubredditDrama,removed,hes fucking right though thanks white people
SubredditDrama,removed,youre not getting it racism is not just when you decide to vote only to fuck over minorities its also when you think fucking over minorities is an acceptable approach to achieve your other political goals
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck mike pence well im glad we can all agree that frying gay peoples brains and driving them to suicide for the crime of being gay is pretty bad maybe in we can agree that women are people too anything can happen if we just make sure that we dont bring up recent history that makes people feel bad about someone telling them they ought to feel bad about not really caring all that much about minorities yeah im out of funny things to say guys xanax and alcohol party at my place everyones invited
SubredditDrama,removed,nah i think it helps to know that some of us are legitimately upset and someone actually agrees with me that chinese conspiracies issues like global warming and scotus appointments dont matter
SubredditDrama,removed,move you fuckin embarrassment your a dude in a dress you will always be just that
SubredditDrama,removed,choke on it ugly
SubredditDrama,removed,a lot of this election centered around white people tired of being demonized let me tell you i have never until this day been ashamed of being a white man i wasnt ignorant of our role in history but i was looking forwards i am part of the first generation of my family who didnt need subsistence farming to survive so i wasnt about to go pinning the slave trade on my ancestors or anything yknow my approach to social justice was very straight forward listen respect analyze support shame hate guilt none of that factored into it but looking at the political landscape around the world looking at the polling data behind whos calling what shots its just its worse than i ever imagined ill humor the opposition for a second and say okay maybe not all trump supporters are racist but trump and his new colleagues most certainly are i see very very little difference between voting in trump and pals because theyre racist and you like it and voting in trump and pals because theyre racist and you dont care i am ashamed because white people have absolutely categorically failed our brothers and sisters this should be a huge wake up call for everyone there is so so much more work to be done
SubredditDrama,removed,yea u can wear ur dress tomorrow no gives a fuck we have real problems to fix your sexuality is not you are a perfect example why people dont like homos the middle class is bleeding to death and u can think about is ur fucking fetish fuck you u selfish dramatic child
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,what the working class base of the party wants is racism thats it theyll happily vote for extreme farright economic policies just as long as they get their racism
SubredditDrama,removed,id say that i marginally prefer pence to cruz because cruz is a fucking monster but i actually do prefer trump to either of them because hes a goddamn moron and id like to think that hes not going to get a second term
SubredditDrama,removed,if i take enough xanax i can effectively not give a shit about anything for at least five hours alcohol probably sounds more sustainable for my denial in the long run however because eventually my doctor will cut me off
SubredditDrama,removed,melllllllllllllt
SubredditDrama,removed,yes of course the trumpsponsored deathsquads are already out there fuck you people are so professional victims
SubredditDrama,removed,im trying to arrange some sort of kinky sex party where i hire a dom to tie us all up and call us stupid americans in some foreign accent while we cry and apologize sounds more fun than watching the inauguration
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,total biscuit is a fucking faggot he was good for telling me if a game was fun but thats about it i hope hes right and this actually makes him die fuck him
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean no we shouldnt thats racism i thought we were against racism
SubredditDrama,removed,my favourite little internet drama ever on a bodybuilding forum about if its possible to work out times a week or not my on twitter is based on it even though im pretty sure theres only three people in the entire world who actually get it and one of them is the person who showed me the bodybuilding drama originally
SubredditDrama,removed,wew lad

SubredditDrama,removed,i liked how top comments disagreed and emphasized free speech and that td users are banned instantly from default subs and have nowhere else to go from longtime users with no history on td benevolent dictatorship ploy backfired badly meanwhile umannoslimmins tells redditors to kill themselves and is not banned because he is a powermod and friend of admins cyber bullying its only bad when those i disagree with do it

SubredditDrama,removed,youre a trump supporter any cursory glance of your comment history reveals that i get tired of how much of a weasel people like you are you sucker punch and then when someone hits you back play victim to gain sympathy and make your opponents look bad we all know the truth youre a bunch of evil individuals who should burn in hell
SubredditDrama,removed,except im not a marxist another td tactic paint your opponent as something you view as vile communist fag cuckservative degenerate who cares if its true long as it sticks crooked hillary lyin ted low energy bush

SubredditDrama,removed,you are correct you are not allowed to post about other seattle subreddits in rseattle and those comments are autoremoved once the mod ucareless learns about your competing subreddit he adds it to his automod list theres at least a dozen subreddits that get autoremoved
SubredditDrama,removed,this is the dumbest shit i ever read on reddit it will take a while but one day you will realize that illegal immigration is making you even flatter faster and more thoroughly while i do recognize that someone this dumb cannot even begin to comprehend what im talking about i do this for others curious enough to see if theres more to it than just simple accusations that fly off the shelf faster than candy yes there is it is a doublewhammy of society engineering in a capitalist society looking for ways to depress wages one whammy happens when an illegal immigrant comes over and is not only getting lowest wage humanly possible but those who are here already suffer a general decline in real wages because not every illegal immigrant ends up on a farm but may end up in your local manufacturing firm or at a construction site
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao this has gotta be from pol right nowhere else has that kind of military grade autismparanoia combo
SubredditDrama,removed,birds using suicide bombings to fight back invaders sounds like palestine
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe a little but some woman like myself like it
SubredditDrama,removed,pretty sure this statement makes you the dumbest motherfucker in here are you going to argue that american society is a wellintegrated society let me hear you say that
SubredditDrama,removed,this is precisely why we need feminism i cant believe people still think this way its smh
SubredditDrama,removed,my favorite part was the exchange with ucrispydiarrheacock about his name
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,her work and posts always seem so clickbaity somehow its all so thinly veiled that its advertised for her blog done by a professional team using her as a pretty facemodel along with her rabid white knights who downvote anyone who makes a negative comment about her
SubredditDrama,removed,she is selling a product though her blog advertises stuff last time i checked every click she gets on her hidden enough so not to violate reddits rules links puts money in her pocket her posts are quite clearly there to sell
SubredditDrama,removed,seriously this shit can you refrain from turning this into another gendered issue i use white knights for anyone trying to defend a person to curry favour or karma for doing so oh yeah all those sites at the bottom of porn videos are just trying to make interesting titles to make people click are they not clickbait what is clickbait then christinne is more clickbaity than other posts on reddit because her goal isnt karma its to get users to go to her blog to anyone replying reddit is doing its fucking stupid wait minutes to reply thing
SubredditDrama,removed,oh yeah lose an argument and then try to come back by claiming you never gave a shit in the first place youre clearly still mentally a teenager if not physically
SubredditDrama,removed,obviously it wouldnt come from her that would break reddits rule of selfadvertising and get her money machine banned if you cant see whats wrong with a user constantly selfadvertising on reddit then i cant really help you can i
SubredditDrama,removed,with that name im not sure if you can p o o i n l o o
SubredditDrama,removed,group of women do thing gamers are angry about it in other news the word cuck has been making the rounds on rthedonald more at
SubredditDrama,removed,tranny is off limits now too i cant keep up with all this shit
SubredditDrama,removed,god the trump spam is overwhelming when will those retards learn no one gives a fuck at least we can take solace in the fact that trumps campaign is wasting time and money advertising on reddit when none of us are going to vote anyways
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe favorite gene to filter out of the pool is the one that multiplies the probability of violence and criminality my a few hundred percent that would be the y chromosome
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah like letting refugees rape their women
SubredditDrama,removed,useless disgusting and easily killed by feeding them enough insecticide
SubredditDrama,removed,so herr asshatvik is a good boy who dindu nuffin you were all in the discord chat some time ago or did you just pretend you little weasel
SubredditDrama,removed,haha so when i call you out for misusing and adding your own agenda typical of regressive leftists who have more in common with the old ussr than george orwell these days to a word you just make another huge presumption about a large mass of people this is so so absurd i dont even know how to reply to that level of sheer wilful density
SubredditDrama,removed,you know the whole being born gay topic was invented by the lbgt lobby to justify their lifestyle it elevated their status to the same as blacks because you were now considered a bigot for being against a perceived inherit disposition make no mistake being gay and lusting after the same sex is a sin no different than incest there is a left minded sickness to accept this behavior as progress tldr being gay is a cultural phenomenon only observed in todays society did not exist in prior dynasties and civilizations and is therefore nurture and not nature
SubredditDrama,removed,im absolutely not im an old school liberal im just not a manipulative thought controlling liar like most of you
SubredditDrama,removed,the details are laid out pretty thoroughly in the linked thread this is srd though people dont read the drama they just come here to complain about how much better they are than reddit users
SubredditDrama,removed,mras get so much unnecessary hate theres real issues worth discussing
SubredditDrama,removed,meaning what
SubredditDrama,removed,then dont bother saying anything
SubredditDrama,removed,bongobongobongo i dont wanna leave the congoyou seemed to hear that novel phrase just about everywhere during the holiday season danny kaye the andrews sisters led the way among five different recorded versions that registered on billboards pop singles charts in music views since mar ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
SubredditDrama,removed,the cia also said there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq they are not abov lying
SubredditDrama,removed,cia concludes shit all the time with no real proof to be fair httpswwwcatoorgpublicationscommentaryciairaqswmd but whats the big issue seriously whether or not the cia was just making another shitpot declaration the big thing theyre claiming is that russia released the dnc emails so theyre a big influence on the election their big contribution was digging up dirt on one candidate while leaving the other alone which is something fucking everyone was doing on both sides
SubredditDrama,removed,wew lads
SubredditDrama,removed,itzzzzz ur fault u cuck
SubredditDrama,removed,if you point out our ties to white nationalists we will believe youre poppin pizza pimping pedos im not seeing how thats a natural response
SubredditDrama,removed,friend of a friend of a friend of mine is literally moving to russia hes become enamored with putin because he hates america so much lol
SubredditDrama,removed,centipedes realize even rpics is not a safe space
SubredditDrama,removed,alright not a trump supporter or even ballpark close can i just say the replies to this drama arent very thoughtful at the time of posting half the posts in this thread are just reiterating the drama and then tagging on but pizzagate as some kind of broad sweeping dismissal thats super lazy if you want to criticise their argument can we really not do better than ad hominem attacks their point about anonymous sources isnt obviously wrong as weve seen a handful of fake stories this election about both major political parties that were from anonymous sources and published in major online sites like cnn washington post and fox news when these stories turn out to be incorrect theyre rarely followed up by a retraction or even edit to the original story it is still a hop skip and jump from some stories by anonymous sources are fake to all stories by anonymous sources are fake so pointing out that hole in their argument is absolutely valid as is pointing out that the nsa themselves have said they believe the russians were implicit in some of the break ins in public not via anonymous sources to me it seems like the difference of opinion here boils down to how much do you trust the washington post and my own trust in them has been badly damaged this cycle if you cannot truth them then you cannot truth their secret sources either since it is ultimately reputation backed but that all being said several intelligence agencies have gone on record in public and said that they believe russia was playing games this election we just havent yet seen the evidence for it since it may be classified eg taken from the nsas huge internet dragnets the only evidence which was released to the public is httpswwwcrowdstrikecomblogbearsmidstintrusiondemocraticnationalcommittee or from annoymous sources
SubredditDrama,removed,why the hate towards charles barkley in that sub

SubredditDrama,removed,just remember benghazi was started with a youtube video you supported that also didnt you
SubredditDrama,removed,obviously the cia is not a trustworthy source of information theyre god damn spies lies is their business they have the credibility of a youtube commenter that said if they have verifiable facts to offer then that might be worth looking at personally ill just accept their story without checking because i dont care enough
SubredditDrama,removed,apparently googling images i guess
SubredditDrama,removed,shamefur dispray
SubredditDrama,removed,r u buttmad frienderoo
SubredditDrama,removed,thats a rude generalization id hope that we would have moved past such things in a postracism nearing postsexism america i suppose not everyone can join the march of progress with the rest of us
SubredditDrama,removed,its completely fucking unreasonable if you think otherwise then you havent yet grasped how truly horrific the holocaust was
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao af boy

SubredditDrama,removed,vinegarbubblegum mnilailt please dont piss in the popcorn people
SubredditDrama,removed,ha ha ha the hurtmad is real in here
SubredditDrama,removed,looks like via your comment history you just troll people all day get laid ya fucking loser lawl maybe seek real human interaction might help with the depression
SubredditDrama,removed,why is it so hard for reddit to understand that some people like hillary i mean regardless of who you support people dont have to be paid by the clintons to agree with her
SubredditDrama,removed,people who claim to be against cultural appropriation often do end up caring about cultural appropriation you just have to figure out what they identify deeply with people on reddit and whining about normies and posers and fake geeks ruining their video games are using essentially the same kind of logic
SubredditDrama,removed,no youre referring to people in libya as brown people in a derogatory fashion to imply that sec clinton is racist without saying so at least have the balls to call her a racist if thats what you think oh also youre just projecting your own ignorance but i get it in your head people from poor countries with strange religions are brown people but just because youre an ignorant racist doesnt mean other people are
SubredditDrama,removed,mimicing cultural appropriation is stil cultural appropriation lmao its icky gross af
SubredditDrama,removed,there are countless examples from history of europeans in the middle east using the head scarf its just practical wear in that climate kinda like how the sombrero is a practical piece of headgear so nobody says its cultural appropriation when oh wait nvm
SubredditDrama,removed,u seem to say that a lot in your history go spend hours a week watching baseball and playing skyrim what a life lol probably have noodle arms and a pot belly lol go cubs blocked so i get the last laugh i guess
SubredditDrama,removed,i couldnt handle it when she started acting the victim because her neighbor wanted her to have halloween candy for trickortreaters grow the fuck up you stupid cunt its halloween and a four year old wants to trick or treat give the fucker some candy and dont be a selfish piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,im sorry circlejerk but that is cultural appropriation hes a member of a social group white that has commited crimes against and has oppressed the group whose cultural item hes using for fun arab you dont stop being white just because you claim you are progressive
SubredditDrama,removed,seeing just how deranged it can get oh god someone needs to troll the fuck out of them can we get this story to their frontpage my neighbors yo female crotchspawn had sex with me when i was drunk and they say she was the one taken advantage of
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think you have a particularly good grasp of what cultures are dominant and which are not you can easily make the argument that there was a historical point where the fighting irish were an offensive stereotype but there are two problems with that line of thought one as an american of majorityirish descent irish is absolutely not a marginalized group in america anymore were just part of white people two notre dames founding fathers were mostly irish catholicsalong with some french hence the university name its certainly possible for a marginalized community to selfoffend but thats a different problem than cultural appropriation
SubredditDrama,removed,aw dont im trying out a new shitposting technique in the comments here and i think its fairly promising
SubredditDrama,removed,thankfully no just the ones with an anti cultural appropriation student union head like brock and u of t and york
SubredditDrama,removed,i refuse to believe you didnt get the too many notes reference
SubredditDrama,removed,hey thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because drama happening on srd should be posted to rsubredditdramadrama for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,removed,dude the costume works because he has a kid dressed as the prince without that you might as well be t e lawrence
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah those are trolls rthedonald users do this a lot drama like this can go on for hours because its all done in the service of the campaign the sad thing is people do take them seriously as hillary supporters or whatever because even the most improbable comments match up with their tiaish ideas of a leftist i thought drama because of obvious trolls are removed from srd if theyre no longer ill make sure to post the next time a trump supporter goes to pretend to be an sjw on tia because the gullible reaction is hilarious actually
SubredditDrama,removed,posted from a former admin and ceo this post on rblog boldly declared the site as a government of a new type of community and marked one of the few administrative actions taken against a trend
SubredditDrama,removed,rwritingprompts
SubredditDrama,removed,and this is white men should rule the world
SubredditDrama,removed,omigod u can make trump win
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont even mind it what pisses me off is the mods bitching about grandstanding yet doing the same thing themselves only they say its setting the tone and if its not offtopic grandstanding its then removed for being a circlebroke comment and to top it off if that doesny happen then the comment gets linked to rdrama whose users then come in here and brigade the comment to shit while pming users to bait them to their sub and srd mods join them in being shit heads crying about srssjw
SubredditDrama,removed,srd mods hate the userbase not liking their memes so when people to the left of them make comments about reddit users and attitudes it pisses of srd mods hence all this shit we have now
SubredditDrama,removed,i left srd for rdrama because the smugposting here has gotten unbearable sure in rdrama theyll call me a faggot but ill just call them a retard back and well both know its all out of love you know and whenever i insult uzachums hes always so nice about it but here ill just be downvoted to and hit with five walls of text for telling people their smugness doesnt always make them right so i welcome any change that will get srd back on track plus these new rules have created way more fresh drama than the usual agendaposting here so kudos for doing your part in manufacturing drama mods
SubredditDrama,removed,it doesnt help when you have reddit employees saying way to confirm the conspiracies uredtaboo this site is run by children
SubredditDrama,removed,lol are you retards acting like that sub is pro trump its trump smear articles are you retards high or just retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,keep on keeping on neckbeard
SubredditDrama,removed,u have a debilitating lack of selfawareness huh
SubredditDrama,removed,thats exactly what it is its trp so srd has to be negative about if the post said that trp all loved no mans sky and someone was like no i dont think they really have an opinion either way theyd get downvoted if the post said that trp hated the color blue and someone said that that probably wasnt true theyd get downvoted srd spends a lot of time thinking about and protecting feminism thus gotta criticize trp in any and all ways my homie u obsess over what srd thinks about some small losers club u have no room to say shit to anyone haha
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit youre pathetic mad about something someone said on the super important internet better obsessively question their age do your hands hurt from constantly clutching pearls over srd by the way
SubredditDrama,removed,dae feel really good about themselves for mocking urban slang i definitely have a lot going on in life
SubredditDrama,removed,how were you able to escape from the selfawareness black hole your birth created
SubredditDrama,removed,stfu retard
SubredditDrama,removed,i have a sneaking suspicion that people who think math is a natural truth are also eurocentrists
SubredditDrama,removed,are you a moron sexism is flawed because it is based on generalisations it is the same thing
SubredditDrama,removed,i trust my gf and i feel pretty much the same way if we ever decide to get married im certainly not going to have a bachelors party why would i i stopped considering myself a bachelor the moment i asked her to be my girlfriend i feel like most people call them bachelor or bachelorette parties because its an easier way of saying party before i make a legal commitment most people dont actually think of them as my last night as a single person for one thing its hardly ever the night directly before the wedding anymore anyway the whole idea of a bachelors party just screams infidelity oh its your last time celebrating being single i know exactly how id celebrate being single if i were actually single sex or you know its a fun night out with your friends without your partner to celebrate your upcoming nuptials i mean youve read enough of this thread to see the trends even if the groomtobe hadnt been planning on anything inappropriate his friends are quite likely engineering those kinds of situations my husband has planned quite a few stagdos since hes been groomsman a few times and best man twice pretty much the plan was go karting getting shitfaced and maybe checking out a strip club if they were sober enough to get in omg so fucking wild right its just a pathetic tradition and i cant help but question the motivations of anyone defending it and yet hes apparently not questioning bachelotte parties which are basically the same thing
SubredditDrama,removed,sdadasdsadsdadsd
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah but youre talking as the same as everyone else as if only clinton is corrupt lol no im not stop putting words in my mouth you disgusting antisemite
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao gobson still whining about reurope you were a total control freak with slight autistic tendencies notice how theres virtually no drama anymore in reurope did it turn into rhitlersreich yet no doing better than ever you have no sense for modding you lack the humanity the autism might be why you take everything so seriously better get that checked
SubredditDrama,removed,redditors like this one are my favorite the ones that go yes it does sound bad that people have to get two or three jobs and that transgender rights shouldnt be a thing but instead of treating people like people ill just keep my money and claim changing any of those things makes no sense because im not the problem what a truly awful person why do i come to this site
SubredditDrama,removed,they arent faggots
SubredditDrama,removed,hollywood isnt literally lynching nonwhites therefore not racist s
SubredditDrama,removed,im mocking you
SubredditDrama,removed,well theyre retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,but worst of all hes a redditor shivers
SubredditDrama,removed,ive seen this attitude among a lot of antisjw folk on reddit infact its a really common thing i dont agree with what you say but i will protect your right to say it is always used to defend hate speech or fucking neonazis i remember threads on tia where they strted sympathizing with nazis and saying shit like i prefer nazis to sjws without hints of self awareness
SubredditDrama,removed,you know this is all too fucking easy to say when its not you on the end of their shit mostly white redditors love to take devils advocate and claim rationality for shit that does not affect them doesnt make you stunning brave or objective youve just granted a safe space for neonazis to spread their bullshit under free speech and if minorities get incensed suddenly its our fault for getting angry at hang mongering fuckheads
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck fascists smash their heads into the ground
SubredditDrama,removed,i get your point but there are degrees openly professing the ideology responsible for and the holocaust is a little more antagonistic than wearing hotpants wtf reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,these are the same people advocating for blm protesters to be shot if they block a road
SubredditDrama,removed,death to fascists
SubredditDrama,removed,dae antifascists are the real fascists shut up with your false moralequivalency
SubredditDrama,removed,but muh fridom of spich
SubredditDrama,removed,and thats what gets to me when its blm or black people in general suddenly some redditors require we provide peer reviewed sources and experimental scientific data to prove the hypothesis that we get discriminated against or they talk about how they would love to run over protesters blocking the roads theres no talk of protecting free speech there but suddenly neonazis are just expressing their different opinions so they should be handled with care
SubredditDrama,removed,nobody is trying to shut up blm or feminists as a matter of fact instead of preventing them from expressing their views people actually dissect their statements and try to have a conversation specious bullshit now if we had all kinds of videos of feminists and blm being violently attacked for their speech your comment would make sense uh no we have threads upon threads of people fantasizing about running over blm protesters or beating feminists on places like rpussypassdenied
SubredditDrama,removed,if you go around telling people of darker skin colour that you wish them dead and wave flags that have been and are still used to perpetrate violence against said minorities dont be surprised when you get elected for some ass whooping
SubredditDrama,removed,id agree with you if i didnt see stormfront poster talking points as top comment in worldnews last year
SubredditDrama,removed,if you advocate genocide under the umbrella of an ideology whose history is centered around killing people based on pigmentation then that is not a controversial opinion those are fighting fucking words and dont expect people to coddle you
SubredditDrama,removed,is there someone that naive that believes that crap white folks
SubredditDrama,removed,why does reddit love comparing themselves to sexually assaulted women
SubredditDrama,removed,when people say this i dont think they usually mean that reddit is literally being brigaded by stormfront users but that the ideology of many redditors is indistinguishable from stormfront it should be unsurprising at this point to see how much racism there is on reddit because reddit is the largest racist forum on the internet its just also lots of other things unlike stormfront
SubredditDrama,removed,the more you know young one the more you know
SubredditDrama,removed,who says it was said apropos of nothing usually when someone says that its apropos of something and something being that they should face some type of charges or in other cases that they should get fucking assaulted christ why is srd so fixated on finding opinions horrible s t o p g r a n d s t a n d i n g t o p g r a n d s t a n d i n g
SubredditDrama,removed,haha look their only defense is not being nazis haha look their only defense is that its not illegal
SubredditDrama,removed,try to keep up
SubredditDrama,removed,right when you do it its cool and speech you agree with should be defended when others do it its not cool and speech you dont agree with shouldnt be defended congratulations you might as well get im a political extremist tattooed across your forehead silly me for assuming a real adult was not one of those
SubredditDrama,removed,i am a bot providing a warning this comment contains the words tree fiddy if it is a story you have been warned proceed with caution message me to remove this comment or add a new copypasta
SubredditDrama,removed,exactly rrelationships is so gullible i can believe a man being selfish and shortsighted but a woman it happens but its much much less likely
SubredditDrama,removed,latino is male latina is female latinx is gender nonconforming its not a term used by anyone seriously and is pretty much a joke
SubredditDrama,removed,wop hun tut spic weeee didnt start the fire
SubredditDrama,removed,i made the mistake of reading the rest of the thread too just to clarify to redditors httpiimgurcomulkypyajpg was a travesty of injustice perpetrated by uptight fundies is real true art that we need more of but httpiimgurcomurkzendjpg is a sign of criminals run amok and the decay of society so white girl titties art all other graffiti regardless of content thugs and criminals and we all know what they mean by thugs by the way
SubredditDrama,removed,dude go check their comment history shits a goldmine of stupidity
SubredditDrama,removed,edit shit i didnt mean to refer to antarcticans as you guys leaving it in there because shame too late the race war has already begun ¡viva antarctica
SubredditDrama,removed,this is amazing i can just imagine his contented blubbering sigh of satisfaction as he hit save thinking to himself i just struck fear into the hearts of those fags for sure
SubredditDrama,removed,so it was a klan rally for being angry at the muslims who still have that century mindset of kill anyone who doesnt worship allahmuhammad whitesjewschristiansatheistsgaysthats you buddy muhammad was a murderous warlord pedophile that fucked a year old and this cult is hiding behind this veil of the religion of peace while committing terrorist attacks almost every single day also tons of muslims want to bring sharia law to the west they are destroying sweden finland and germany right now as we know it they are dangerous people who cant adapt to modern society for some reason and need to stay in their middleeastern shitholes

SubredditDrama,removed,i find it kind of weird the way the conversation in that httpsislimgeaefdppng went between the usodypop and the mods at rthedonald basically sodypop asks for help to prevent disruption of modding in rpolitics and even says that a mod in rthedonald was partly responsible yet for some reason as soon as the rthedonald mods ask for a name so they could demod the person sodypop then says it wasnt really a big deal and he was temporarily suspended why not just tell them who did it so they could demod the guy why expect that this would end any differently when going up against rthedonald a nest of trolls what kind of stupid yet juicy situation is this
SubredditDrama,removed,go drink bleach
SubredditDrama,removed,you honestly believe expert trolls will leave peacefully
SubredditDrama,removed,its about ethics in image hosting
SubredditDrama,removed,so you flipped the words around jesus christ
SubredditDrama,removed,you can do it in a way that doesnt make you a dick
SubredditDrama,removed,they also remove any reference to my subreddit rthedonaldunleashed where that kind of talk is allowed however they dont do the same for other trump subreddits such as mrtrump where the moderators are all exmods of thedonald frankly they should just stand up and say they wont remove posts but they wont do that they are in the admins pocket and playing their userbase for fools
SubredditDrama,removed,no that not even the same analogy as his comment you fucking retard
SubredditDrama,removed,they also remove any reference to my subreddit rthedonaldunleashed where that kind of talk is allowed however they dont do the same for other trump subreddits such as mrtrump where the moderators are all exmods of thedonald frankly they should just stand up and say they wont remove posts but they wont do that they are in the admins pocket and playing their userbase for fools this will blow over and no one will leave as they slowly chip away at the things you can say at that subreddit in the end they cucked themselves

SubredditDrama,removed,the point is that she wasnt comfortable with the white hairdresser i couldnt possibly criticize a person from an oppressed people because they dont feel comfortable with someone of her oppressors group its an insane thing to do to tell them how they should feel about their situation i dont know if theres a term for this like mansplaining
SubredditDrama,removed,rblackladies should have been banned along with rcoontown and the rest of the shit purge a year ago
SubredditDrama,removed,yo oxus can you tell me how this is a biased title user takes his opportunity to talk about how misguided islam is in a thread about muhammad ali juicy drama ensues not trying to be a dick or anything but it seems pretty neutral
SubredditDrama,removed,muh freezepeach cucks cucks cucks
SubredditDrama,removed,firstly trumpettes is one of the lowest energy insults ive heard and secondly going back to your first comment so you disagree that pretty much the one group of people muslims doing the majority of terror attacks on the west shouldnt be banned right so you are ok to sacrifice a few people like the bataclan attack just because of feelz how do you think the thousands of people killed families feel about it how many of those people killed if had the chance would change their minds about certain immigrants remember feelz are better than realz though amirite
SubredditDrama,removed,do you think its okay for a white person to refuse hair cuts from black people is a white person a member of an oppressed people and the black person a member if his oppressors people no then its not the saaaaaaaame
SubredditDrama,removed,opposed to the donald which is pure middle school cancer

SubredditDrama,removed,on reddit the man is always right
SubredditDrama,removed,it feels like reddit might unintentionally be the biggest white supremacist website on the internet weird
SubredditDrama,removed,white people were a mistake
SubredditDrama,removed,hey now that only applies if theyre gay and we all know no true fascist is gonna be one of those people
SubredditDrama,removed,here goes reddit making things weird again on one end folks we got some hopelessly indifferentiable raciststrollmemestersconfusedormaybenonwesternpeople and on the other side we have the body of reddit consumed by newest controversy they could amplify distort villify and eventually beat a dead horse with lets ring the bell and see how many casualties will be taken by the admins and the extremists get out your popcorn its going to be a rsubredditdrama extravaganza
SubredditDrama,removed,cant we just live and let live i dont understand why some people feel the need to ruin the reddit experience for others just because they hold views that are considered abominable if they want to jerk off over aryan goddesses in their sad little sub let them who is it hurting this whole brigading effort just seems immature to me
SubredditDrama,removed,are you gonna take one for the team and tell them colored folk they need to stop fancying and submitting nsfw pics of white girls and they should stick to their own race youre a brave one
SubredditDrama,removed,the whole problem with this shitty site is that everyone just downvotes comments that trigger them nobody seems to understand the principle that you dont downvote on this basis you downvote comments that are irrelevant so instead of presenting a wellreasoned response to my comment i just get a bunch of snarky comments by people who think theyre way funnier than they really are and a shitload of downvotes honestly the occasions on which someone makes the effort to actually present a wellreasoned counterargument are few and far between and i really appreciate it when it does happen
SubredditDrama,removed,go fuck yourself lying sack of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,even if i get banned for witch hunting you someone will continue my work you are fraud i gave enough evidence to prove that i made you nothing on reddit and imgur just deal with it and actually go work something in your restaurant that you love so much
SubredditDrama,removed,these reddit sjws are starting to lose it
SubredditDrama,removed,oh this place seemed like a parody wow why are so many redditors so fucking dumb
SubredditDrama,removed,did you watch the video watch it again and try to imagine that white guys is replaced with literally any other ethnic group or gender
SubredditDrama,removed,whats wrong with people making a subreddit to look at beautiful white people not everyone is equally attracted to all races and thats fine isnt it
SubredditDrama,removed,no grandstanding would be to say reddit is racist and youre one of the racists making this site shit
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit dude you arent socrates
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahaha this guy got gold for shutting the cuck train down upvotes bracketed by comments with under
SubredditDrama,removed,happy holidays ya bigot fuck at this point its not even ironic for them to get so incredibly mad at the jokes at their expense just the expected outcome a neverending crueltyfree popcorn source
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,is this the daily circlejerk of trump thread for srd
SubredditDrama,removed,as much as a person doesnt like hillary i dont think you could honestly call her a joke candidate anyway she was a serious politician with the experience to do the job trump is an angry haircut
SubredditDrama,removed,right this is why trump won dammit
SubredditDrama,removed,because the proper response to people complicit with aggressive white nationalism is not debate its telling them to fuck off i have no obligation to be kind to oppressive actors even if they have no clue what the fuck it is they voted for
SubredditDrama,removed,cultural diversity generally equals importing islam islam outbreeds the local population gets and democratically introduces islamic laws or laws following the spirit of islam which in the end reduces liberty before happens there is a ton of minor opression mostly towards women or so also limits liberty as goverments introduce spying laws checkpoints etc
SubredditDrama,removed,get fucked
SubredditDrama,removed,so loaded thats an impressive siege mentality there mate well thats a good thing if you come in here slinging punches so tell me is it the marxists that are leading this shadow islam cabal hellbent on conquering the world through breeding no i dont think that however i do think that hard left folks who are marxists often like and welcome islam so while not leading they definitely are complicit do you honestly have no idea how education and material conditions affect birth rates i have better idea than you i guess are you aware that the european muslims while having a lower birthrate than their african counterparts still have doublei believe its more than that but i dont have the statistics handy the birthrate of local population
SubredditDrama,removed,awww did he hurt your feefees

SubredditDrama,removed,stop it laci i need you to stop following me around my reddit im not a bot just a maddog mama whose mad as hell that she is being victimized

SubredditDrama,removed,ah yes wont someone think of the man who doesnt want a kid for once fuck that noise child support is for the kid not her she deserves it to help support the child he fathered
SubredditDrama,removed,probably not real most likely its something called arg an augmented reality game typically args are narrative driven and are filled with puzzles that users must solve to advance the plot the puzzles range from secret codes to irl drop boxes that players must gather and share its really just a big community role playing experience honestly if this turns out to be real ill eat my hat
SubredditDrama,removed,oh fuck off that is nowhere near reality there are huge differences the least of which is that you can have it reversed its a procedure done in under minutes with no real risks and you can be back to work in a couple days this isnt fucking heart surgery and how is this not a better outcome than having to pay and care for a child for years when you know you will never want children
SubredditDrama,removed,since all cops are racist kill the police right
SubredditDrama,removed,right i get that but as ive looked into this whole deal if this is indeed an arg it really off the vibe that its plot is going in a the lottery thing was a trap and this fake corporation thats a front for something sinister kidnapped the winner direction especially in light of this corporations most recent httpstwittercomspecorgcorp and in light of the former employee posting on that sub talking about how theyre very good at keeping track of people and needing to get off the grid before feeling safe giving more information obviously if its an arg they cant actually kidnap someone so one of the people running the game sets up an account and pretends to be the lottery winner saying he didnt claim the prize and wants out setting up that plot development
SubredditDrama,removed,insinuating theres institutional racism and that a typical police officer is racist
SubredditDrama,removed,are you actually tracking that keeping meticulous notes of usernames complaining about games which broke explicit promises and then crossreferencing it when that issue comes up another time because if so i would love to see your database it sounds fascinating dont be a cunt

SubredditDrama,removed,hi it looks like youre discussing vasectomies i can help with that vasectomy costs vary from between and depending on your state income level health insurance and access to a planned parenthood center this includes the followup sperm count httpswwwplannedparenthoodorglearnbirthcontrolvasectomy
SubredditDrama,removed,hi it looks like youre discussing vasectomies i can help with that effectiveness is an important and common concern when choosing a birth control method vasectomy is the most effective birth control for men it is nearly percent effective however vasectomy is not immediately effective sperm remains beyond the blocked tubes you must use other birth control until the sperm are used up it usually takes about three months a simple test — semen analysis — shows when there are no more sperm in your ejaculate very rarely tubes grow back together again and pregnancy may occur this happens in about out of cases
SubredditDrama,removed,jesus christ dude the superiority complex you have is just radiating off of you

SubredditDrama,removed,good and sensible and moral policy if you are an immigrant or a descendant of immigrants without any native ancestor then you have to go back especially if you are part of a group that has a massively higher rate of political violence and is a menace to the established order

SubredditDrama,removed,yeah the whole oh yeah all the kids in highschool are or whatever excuse has existed for as long as this type of questionable content has existed its a surface level defense at the best but one thats pretty easily seen through whatever you say mate i guess you are the arbiter of age in video games you seem like someone who knows your position is indefensible and instead you need to resort to insults yeah i dont think the twitch devs should ignore someone whom they have punished without recourse is a real indefensible position no he got a response the response was we dont want to host your game full stop thats the response and in court the judge just says you are guilty no explanation required right and name me other games where the core focus is the sexulization torture and murder of high school students that are played on twitch bonus points if you can name one thats ever had more than viewers or generated enough awareness for twitch to even notice it if you watch the video you keep shit talking you would see several examples the platform is hosted in america its advertisers and parent company are american companies its payment providers are american companies i dont know why you are being such a cunt they can do what they want and im going to criticize them for that they owe the guy some sort of explanation for blackballing him
SubredditDrama,removed,years of western propaganda more like witnessing and reading about the well documented extremely negative effects and living conditions of communism throughout the last few decades and today have no respect for you commie scum fuck you you might not be as bad as a nazi but thats not a very high bar you piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,youre defending a pointless idiotic strawman says the guy who just attacked a strawman and defined sjw as a screaming pinkgreenhaired morbidly obese misandrist who cant do anything except shriek and cry like a little baby evidently thats what you think youre being called when people call you and sjw but thats not what im calling you when i call you an sjw i cant speak for everyone else who has ever called you an sjw but most of them probably werent calling you that either anybody even slightly left as being a giant fat pinkhaired toddler woman from tumblr thats all it gets used for that is not all it gets used for as you just indicated its often used to describe anybody even slightly left thats all it means in that context its not calling anybody even slightly left anything else just pointing out the fact that they are even slightly left i know you dont approve of the term being used in that way thats irrelevant nobody asked you nobody cares if you approve that is how it is used by some people and that is what they mean getting triggered and throwing temper tantrums like you have here isnt going to accomplish anything other than making you look like a child bunch of inane blathering insults swearing and acting like youre ok buddy i recommend counseling youre blocked
SubredditDrama,removed,your history is full of nothing but one line quips you dont seem capable of insightful discussion you are blocked
SubredditDrama,removed,bash the fash
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah its so shitty not to call people nuggets and faggots or broadcast rape of minors the world has gone to garbage since those things were taken from us
SubredditDrama,removed,uchepamec is also a moderator in rlepen fascists gonna fash
SubredditDrama,removed,what the fuck are you talking about you goddamned lunatic
SubredditDrama,removed,in his opinion the mods need to protect him from himself by opting out of rall it reminds me of the argument that all men are creeps so wear modest clothing or expect to be harassed or worse
SubredditDrama,removed,so nazis all over the globe are coming together for some kind of international nationalism wonderful on a slightly offtopic note is there an internet equivalent of bashing the fash like i dunno ddosing the fash somebodys gotta be organizing a way to disrupt their nazi shitposting
SubredditDrama,removed,okay but they are still comparable on some level tho thats the point the idea that walking into a pc sub to talk about xbox is an appropriate way to criticize someone going out of their way to bodyshame is childish
SubredditDrama,removed,lol ur offended kek i win okay bub
SubredditDrama,removed,hey retard i talk about how i understand how the analogy works i think its inappropriate sorry you have trouble with literacy
SubredditDrama,removed,enjoy being this butthurt about vidya
SubredditDrama,removed,you have to be a fucking retard to think that an analogy doesnt make any attempt to create some comparability one is people being butthurt about vidya the other is bodyshaming come on babe it isnt hard
SubredditDrama,removed,ur precious pc video games that people are tainting with vile xbox discussion
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,wow lol good one did u learn that hot meme on reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,but youd probably put me up to a firing squad ur victim complex is a total fatty
SubredditDrama,removed,i learned them in
SubredditDrama,removed,saw this from the crosspost so heres a link to her instagram httpswwwinstagramcomnatcurvylicious not weighing in either way about the shop or not but adding uhh data to the conversation
SubredditDrama,removed,so as long as you personally can masturbate to her pictures shes allowed to keep posting
SubredditDrama,removed,you realize you look retarded right
SubredditDrama,removed,and thats why you purge all those cunts in one fell swoop with no fucks given because theyll push and push and take advantage of your ideals of openness and honest discourse and use them to shit all over the very same ideals as soon as theyre in charge fuckem bootem from the goddamn site and from every other social media site as well let their cries of muh censorship thatiwastotallygoingtoimposeonyouonceigotincharge echo throughout the internet
SubredditDrama,removed,unfortunately it is a little bit shopped if you take a look at httpswwwinstagramcomnatcurvylicious the pic of her on her bed and all the others but this clearest example shows that although shes still got a curvy figure there is a bit more on her hips and waist still looks amazing to me though
SubredditDrama,removed,time to organize liberal antifa brigades whose up for it
SubredditDrama,removed,man its getting really obvious rdrama was closed down
SubredditDrama,removed,and the president of the united states
SubredditDrama,removed,white people are the reason why this march was organized in the first place white people need to know their place
SubredditDrama,removed,no the grandmothers are usually denying that their grandsons would do such a thing its the grandsons themselves that say shit like that
SubredditDrama,removed,lol white people
SubredditDrama,removed,uthereasontrumpwon
SubredditDrama,removed,right i forgot this was still a mostly liberal sub thats my mistake
SubredditDrama,removed,i was answering their question
SubredditDrama,removed,get out tard
SubredditDrama,removed,oh i wasnt meaning to sorry i meant specifically the users and me who have responded here to his feminism comment as we
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah if you want the source just go to the rcurvy post its all over those comments
SubredditDrama,removed,then maybe perhaps the srd post should be deleted considering the moment you click on it you barely have to scroll anywhere to find all that personal info
SubredditDrama,removed,the problem is that you are a filthy globalist man
SubredditDrama,removed,isnt that basically thedonald sadly assholes seem to thrive being around other assholes they just take it as validation that their shitty attitudes are ok and the rest of us normal people are just sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,or just pm a picture a day to this guy that way we arent breaking any vote manipulation rules that would get us shut down
SubredditDrama,removed,i love how this subreddit is rdrama most of you obviously need to move to rcirclejerk i cant believe this person does not vote for my criminal and gives me their money entitled children amazingly you do not realize how hypocritical some of you are keep posting your le trump is maymay and maybe someday it will become true
SubredditDrama,removed,im very skeptical of the notion that anyone on rnegareddit is capable of carrying out an act of political violence with any semblance of competence which makes this drama extra pointless
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe theyre just really young and dont know history very well they post on redditso the chances are already really elevated theyre not older than college age they post on a far left meta sub so now were down to like a chance
SubredditDrama,removed,at the bare minimum we know ctr was astroturfing online conversations about the election i suspect the mass astroturfing that took place on reddit was not from an open facing org like ctr though also td is moderated by jewish shills nowadays you wont find nazis there anymore
SubredditDrama,removed,negareddit is filled with actual retarded autists though if you post there and not just to fuck with people who cry when theyre misgendered you should punch yourself in whatever genitalia youve decided to have today and of course your logic will make no sense like freaking the fuck about not being able to call for violence when its not really the varsity football team or a division squad right
SubredditDrama,removed,they dont care when its against other groups so why not
SubredditDrama,removed,im starting to think the subreddit had the right idea about you
SubredditDrama,removed,the us hasnt learned the lesson other developed countries have about that
SubredditDrama,removed,it was banned unfortunately cant a guy just incite mass murder in peace
SubredditDrama,removed,so why do they continue to let the extreme right wing dominate reddit a new extremest right wing sub pops up everyday ontop of the ones we already have td altright blacklivessplatter a real great place im sure bigly hillaryforprison mrtrump uncensored news doesnt sound like a right wing sub but its basically yet another trump sub world news got invaded by the altright and trump supporters months ago and they fit in well with the putin bots yet one left wing sub and its gone yet shit like islam is evil or cant wait for a rapefugee to come here so i can put a bullet in his skull or posts called defend european diversity is okay reddit get your head out of your fucking ass and fix it
SubredditDrama,removed,are you just copypasting shit from the linked comments or just trying to bring the drama home with you
SubredditDrama,removed,but they are so youre just going to have to deal with us lol
SubredditDrama,removed,its incredible and hilarious how easily srs triggers you people its almost as if thats their goal and their targets are too stupid not to play right into it
SubredditDrama,removed,whats the opposite of mansplaining listening and engaging in thoughtful conversation ha not wrong though
SubredditDrama,removed,lol fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,benevolent sexism is absolutely a thing though but i guess jerking about the sjws is more important
SubredditDrama,removed,im just disgusted by liberals inability to have any kind of self criticism or awareness liberal feminism is a sham if you want to get woke af at least get into some marxist feminism grabs popcorn
SubredditDrama,removed,yea women can mansplain men mansplain and women womensplain but mansplaining is more prevalent i still think the word mansplain is fucking stupid but you gotta describe it somehow
SubredditDrama,removed,rnojustno is triggered butthurt mad
SubredditDrama,removed,there are some people who still get me a early trans girl confused with a year old male coworker of mine some people dont pay attention and it being kansas most people arent thinking about trans stuff uthereasontrumpwon
SubredditDrama,removed,shouldnt your name be ustrawmanville
SubredditDrama,removed,did you just assume their gender
SubredditDrama,removed,its most likely because its a bunch of white dudes arguing about race which historically always goes well
SubredditDrama,removed,did you just assume that hypothetical womans gender
SubredditDrama,removed,americans will never understand this
SubredditDrama,removed,miles does so if you have a black family you are now black my cousin is black how much time do i have to spend with him before i can go around calling myself black youre not enlighted because youre colorblind and not in america youre just pretending it doesnt exist around you to not feel guilty oh motherfucker you didnt just try to lecture me in my own culture race in latin america amount to you look x a person saying things like i identify as black is as meaningless as saying i identify as blond so please save yourself you articles by patronizing cachacos
SubredditDrama,removed,im trying to understand where you are coming from but all i see is your username are you are troll or something friedrich nietzsche wasnt antisemitic or nationist perhaps but his sister who reworked his writing was this isnt a personal attack but im not sure if you quite understand what race is if you agree with him
SubredditDrama,removed,dont worry about bowletta he or she is a month old account only has a few posts about games and then goes straight into this drama
SubredditDrama,removed,also dont bother responding to federico nietzsche his username is very similar to friedrich nietzche which is you know anything about that theres no point in responding ahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,it was pk was confronted with evidence of his constant pedo apologia and defense of a pedo lost his shit and started the chant that noway was the pedo all along of this drama is fabricated by pk as seen in his numerous pouts to rdrama and everyone keeps falling for it just because he says it loud and often
SubredditDrama,removed,no just people who are still clinton supporters
SubredditDrama,removed,and what was your political education again horseshoe theory in theory means that the structure of the state becomes so far right or so far left that theyre nearly indistinguishable and of course the dprk is the model of this it may or may not apply elsewhere for a variety of reasons not the least of which is the far lefts insistence that theres never been a far left government all while defending them naturally lol in practice conversationally it means that regardless of motive or goals the means by which the far left and far right push their agendas are virtually identical weve seen in this very thread those similarities yeah responding to political positions that you dont like with violence is way different from responding to political positions that you dont like with violence saying its a threat to my way of life or the way of life i hope to have in the future so attacking these people for their politics is okay is extremely different from saying its a threat to my way of life or the way of life i hope to have in the future so attacking these people for their politics is okay uimnotpayingfullprice now if you want to sit here and say the actual academic theory sucks first of all i dont think youre going to do well on your thesis with such a sweet argument and second its going to be shitty thesis to begin with because someone will always criticize the examples you use as not being true but thirdly you shouldnt even do that anyway because its rather clear that on reddit its used in the practical conversational way no go back to anarchism school or whatever the fuck you do
SubredditDrama,removed,just like how the dea is funding a war on drugs for profit while benefitting the private prison industry to keep modern slavery alive or that the fact that the inequality of wealth of the and everyone else is the highest its ever been but you dont care about that because of those damn bikers you should google alabama victoria secret and youll really get an idea of who you are
SubredditDrama,removed,why are they going after that poor woman shes actively looking for help she sounds pretty naive about conversion therapy and their response is that she is to blame not the guy who took the kid but its her fault those are some legitimately terrible people
SubredditDrama,removed,haha guess donald mods were the ones doing the trolling chess
SubredditDrama,removed,lol you post on enoughtrumpspam you guys cant even be original what was funny was when the trump supporter said he disavowed you guys upvoted it to the top then he edited that shit lmao feminist sjw shithole just like this sub you cant even admit you like shillary there thats how embarrassed yall are
SubredditDrama,removed,normally i wouldnt respond to ets but they really think they fooled ulilz and i we were just playing along with those morons
SubredditDrama,removed,stupidity
SubredditDrama,removed,this sub is a shithole so is my asshole asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,dae poes law
SubredditDrama,removed,congratulations on being objectively wrong
SubredditDrama,removed,that sub is an aspieridden shithole for pasty white kids who suck kanye cock and jack off over basketball sneakers that theyll never wear cuz they cant jump for shit
SubredditDrama,removed,youre pretty shitty for letting that sub stay as it is
SubredditDrama,removed,racist events happen all around the us at any given time the next time you see a kkk rally harassing an interracial couple are you just going to say hey fuck it this happens all the time and is bound to happen again our government doesnt do anything oh well what a dumb as fuck reason to keep that sub open youre an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,your comparison is far more asinine than mine is are you serious maybe you frequent that sub creep
SubredditDrama,removed,ill give myself a time out not interested in sticking around a place that defends a rape fantasy sub but gets bent out of shape when the word idiot is used to describe a misogynistic poster
SubredditDrama,removed,aw uprankzta deleted his account like a bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,oh you see its just how sjws like uquitesoindeed operate for them its not about actual facts and arguments its about us versus them good vs evil so there are more islamic terrorists than christians is an argument for the good side and automatically refutes all evil arguments against their previous the ottoman empire was bad see also httpsenwikipediaorgwikimanichaeismfigurativeuse
SubredditDrama,removed,again with the insults thats not an insult thats a statement of fact if you say well x did y and someone refutes you with no x didnt do y and youre like but x did z then you are not right in the head thats just how it works among notinsane people sorry
SubredditDrama,removed,im confused billywill you guys state in the channel description that were not here to shove low quality evidence in peoples faces but you did when dan posted to rparanormal just let people stumble upon it naturally instead of breaking the illusionatmoshpere of the videos
SubredditDrama,removed,yo wake up islam murders apostates all across the islamic fucking world exmuslims are simply beheaded jailed or stoned to death or killed outright by a mob or their government for simply leaving the religion of islam and wanting to become nonreligious they get killed for blasphemy or killed for wanting to become a christian jew hindu buddhist or atheistthey are fucking killed by their own dumbass islamo government i have nothing against muslims as some muslims as individuals can be good people and do not follow that shitty koran or quran to the letter like their other islamist friends do but islam itself is fucked up and wrong and it is you zombieshateninjas who is the fucking bigot here defending those islamics and i can not believe the number of dumb sjw zombies who upvoted your shitty comment islam kills people for apostacy islam murders cartoonists and put a fatwa on a dude for writing a frigging book kills nonmuslims or kill those who want to become exmuslim islam fucking murders people for apostacyim sorry for typing three times and in all caps but to get the message through a dumb leftwing trudeau loving titelbowing thick ass dumb skull as yours it needed to be done three times and in all caps beofre you preach anymore bs do us all a favor and go take a month out and fucking read their stupidass books the koran or quran sunnah hadi and bukhari can all be downloaded for free and translated into whatever language you read so read them before you write any more bs and i will write it once more to be clear you dumb fuck islam fucking murders people for apostacyyou stupid fucking leftwing canadian sjw dumbass
SubredditDrama,removed,they keep others up that dont have problematic language though but thats a good point
SubredditDrama,removed,its disgusting how idiots claim that feminism is bad
SubredditDrama,removed,youre oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of adding nothing to the discussion snapshots this post from this thread in negareddit ueternalfight httpsarchiveiscnnuj a rshitliberalssay thread i am a bot rsnapshillbot messagecomposetorsnapshillbot

SubredditDrama,removed,if morality is personal preference how can you tell me i shouldnt do something that harms someone else i can just say i dont believe that harm is morally bad and you cant debate me because thats just my preference because i dont have time for your smug philosophical wankery and want to eat a fucking hamburger in peace go be a selfrighteous twat on badphil
SubredditDrama,removed,literally sexual assault
SubredditDrama,removed,sexual assault dear goodness then a lot of stuff should be punished as well like public displays of affection fat people in swim showing excessive skin etc etc at some point people need to ease on the executioners switch
SubredditDrama,removed,fucking gringos
SubredditDrama,removed,as a nonamerican the idea that the us doesnt a culture is fairly funny given you guys won the cultural victory conditions in the we watch your movies and tv listen to your music wear your clothes and follow your fashion trends and your bastardization of the english language is become more and more common outside your country seriously tho fuck you guys
SubredditDrama,removed,what a shitty move just because these people are white supremacists and advocate for the genocide of nonwhites doesnt mean you should give them incorrect directions
SubredditDrama,removed,like amy schumer amiright guys plis upvote is popular opinion

SubredditDrama,removed,your city is emblematic of everything that i hate i voted for a man who only ever uses its name as a pejorative please help me get to a party celebrating this not saying he shouldve done it but i understand
SubredditDrama,removed,its incredible seeing rsubredditdrama filled with whiny morons who think that hillary would have been better wall streets vile whore an even worse war monger than obama a woman who would have continued bombing brown people and supporting corporations fucking over americans its really amusing that you all still cant get over trump winning and these whiny bourgeoise liberal celebrities talking about revolution and bombing the white house because he refuses to play your idiotic identity politics is pathetic it really is telling seeing rich privileged blackshispanics lecture poor desperate working class whites how privileged they are while these same rich progressive celebrities support pro corporate policies
SubredditDrama,removed,why are you backing up the fool whites are a global minority is a dog whistle for white genocide not supremacy
SubredditDrama,removed,i stopped lurking rxboxone since all they ever do cry about xbox haters say fanboy crap thats dumber than both fanboys say
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you personally i hate buddhism its religion masquerading as philosophy and has managed to dupe the likes of even sam harris but i agree that violence begets violence and hate begets hate and if you hold hate in your heart you will probably be a miserable person tldr fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,the train is dirty so its ok to put your feet on the seats people in the thread the part where the train is dirty because of that attitude never occurred to them i guess no wonder theyre against trump tbh
SubredditDrama,removed,are you fucking dense the american people did not elect trump as he lost the popular vote the electoral college elected trump
SubredditDrama,removed,ah i see you are dense
SubredditDrama,removed,why are you being so aggressive and no im not looking for approval im just telling you that your religion is seriously fucked up and needs to be reformed

SubredditDrama,removed,fag
SubredditDrama,removed,because youre a prototypical social justice warrior and its your code that you must open threads like these to see if theres anything not sufficiently politically correct

SubredditDrama,removed,reddit at large has this weird idea that art is just supposed to look nice or tell a story or sound good anytime theres a hint of a deeper meaning they all hide and shout sometimes the curtains are just blue a novel doesnt have themes its just some stuff that happens the most annoying example is that post that pops up all the time of picassos two self portraits every time it turns into a circlejerk about how the one from when he was sixteen is better because its more realistic like im not even into art or literature but how fucking ignorant can you be
SubredditDrama,removed,my comicsnooooo something ill never read or give the time of day is literally ruining the world and rustling all the jimmies i have left first the woman came for my games and i didnt speak then the pao came for my reddit and i didnt speak now the blacks have come for my comics noooo jesus some pathetic babies love to bitch and moan and argue

SubredditDrama,removed,mods are gods

SubredditDrama,removed,white knight is antimen i am a man you idiot i guess if we follow your logic calling someone a dick is a antiman slur seeing as penises are only on men is asshole an antihuman term

SubredditDrama,removed,can you give me an example of how you would write the title it seems to be pretty much in line with whats posted on the sub
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit false rape accusations against men are terrible isnt it horrific that a man cant even go to the park by himself without being accused of being a paedophile for playing with his daughter reddit dan schneider is a child molester because of a meme and a blind article that doesnt even mention him supposedly written by rdj and because he takes pictures with the actors he works with on set for hours a day for years of his and their lives
SubredditDrama,removed,it only took years to disappoint adam adam must not spend that much time on reddit then
SubredditDrama,removed,wow those commenters seemed pretty triggered by her hair these redditors will just take offence to anything maybe they need a safe space
SubredditDrama,removed,sums up my reddit experience in general
SubredditDrama,removed,wow props to adam savage but i bet that jesus christ bernie sanders himself could show up and these assholes would still lose their shit over this stuff the kid probably isnt even into social justice but no keep acting like a goddamn year old the best thing is that the type of people to criticize her look are likely the same ones who bitch about being judged as pedos for being men around children
SubredditDrama,removed,what the fuck is wrong with people anyways angry ass neckbeards that cant help themselves taking a cheap shot at a kid then try to justify it with some unrelated straw man argument dumbasses deserve to get left behind in the stone age or their parents basement
SubredditDrama,removed,its about ethics in branding journalism
SubredditDrama,removed,this is like when a kid hides under a table and thinks if i cant see them they cant see me just because you dont know doesnt mean things didnt happen this is very disappointing im tagging you as not reliable i hope youre happy now
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit is a cunt cave
SubredditDrama,removed,i swear to fuck reddit is biggest safe space on the internet i genuinely feel like of reddit userbase would shite themselves if they had to deal with the real world

SubredditDrama,removed,to clear up whatever confusion is present from utigerears what is wrong with equality in context this implies that if you like equality you would consider yourself a feminist i offered an explanation of why someone who likes equality would not want to be considered a feminist from dictionarycom egalitarian asserting resulting from or characterized by belief in the equality of all people especially in political economic or social life again just explaining a perspective not trying to argue whether feminismegalitarianism is a better choice
SubredditDrama,removed,my favorite in the were the angry fag punks who really were gay and would be they guys who would flip their shit and brawl when they got hate

SubredditDrama,removed,dude youre really thick lmao feminism is a form of degeneracy brought on by wealth romes problems started from within
SubredditDrama,removed,whereas healthy and welladjusted people move on the losers stay on and reddit says the guy who posts on reddit everyday for two years httpsnoopsnoocomudeviantgrayson is a great resource longest period between two consecutive posts hours
SubredditDrama,removed,thats cause youre a little cuck faggot probably didnt vote for brexit either big fan of hordes of muslim savages and sending welfare to leetching migrants

SubredditDrama,removed,suck it up snowflakes its not your web site and the admins can do whatever they like you lost and you should just get over it your subreddit sucks and at this point the only reason im aware you still exist is because you all whine so much daily about how you are victims making america great by bitching like a year old continuously
SubredditDrama,removed,names his account after candidate calls other people shills mental illness

SubredditDrama,removed,lefties brigade us too lol since when is brigading and getting a bunch of people on your side to do their part against rules lolling
SubredditDrama,removed,it never ceases to amaze me how you retards will call anyone with a differing opinion then you a shill news flash dickweed trump lost the popular vote by million votes now i know thats a really big number but if you use your fingers to count it out thats six zeros there are a lot of people that really dont like trump and if you left your echo chamber and actually stepped outside your basement you would realize that the difference is pcmr doesnt constantly go to other subreddits and cry about them being an echo chamber the fact that you dont even realize the hypocrisy doesnt even suprise me at this point because its obvious youre really fucking stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,they have nothing better to do shut the fuck up we are on reddit reddit is actually the posterchild of not having anything to do
SubredditDrama,removed,white fragility is real
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao cuz anybody reads them lol
SubredditDrama,removed,im going to assume uthegeoninja is just saying this to convince geriatric orange moron fans to listen to him if they get the smallest hint that you might have something reasonable to say their tongues start wiggling in the back of their throats and they begin murmuring cuck always give people the benefit of the doubt thegeoninja is a kind liar not a retard
SubredditDrama,removed,you sound salty af
SubredditDrama,removed,i should point out my great grandfather was one of those jewish terrorists who helped to murder british civilians and my family were always very proud of his role in the formation of israel so it is interesting to see uthemufti squirming his way around this issue
SubredditDrama,removed,i didnt refuse to answer the question i directly answered the question very clearly attempt ill try again do you deny that jewish terrorist mass murdered innocent british civilians no i havent said anything about it because its not related to this thread the no is a direct no i dont deny that and then i go on to say especially because it hasnt come up in this thread i go on to discuss how its not actually relevant to the thread at hand but an attempt to deflect from the conversation at hand its a very clear and well defined example of whataboutism i have no issue acknowledging that there was terrorism in israels founding i have issue with the fact that its brought up and badgered after it was acknowledged in an explicit attempt to deflect from the wikipedia definition whataboutism is a term describing a propaganda technique used by the soviet union in its dealings with the western world during the cold war when criticisms were leveled at the soviet union the response would be what about followed by the naming of an event in the western world it represents a case of tu quoque or the appeal to hypocrisy a logical fallacy which attempts to discredit the opponents position by asserting the opponents failure to act consistently in accordance with that position without directly refuting or disproving the opponents initial argument the term describing the technique was popularized in by edward lucas in an article for the economist lucas said that this tactic is observed in the politics of modern russia along with this being evidence of a resurgence of cold war and sovietera mentality within russias leadership its somewhat misleading to describe this as me refusing to answer a yes no question especially when it was asked once and the line immediately after it starts with no isnt it
SubredditDrama,removed,am canadian love trump youre a cuck
SubredditDrama,removed,the only acceptable degree is from trump university all other degrees btfo sad magamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagmatrumpsuckscockmagamagamafamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagamagma

SubredditDrama,removed,go to bed kiddos daddy will be home tomorrow and he is going to make things ok again quit crying and go to sleep for years
SubredditDrama,removed,are you asking that of others whove insulted my intelligence motives and beliefs am i not allowed to tell my experience or my side of things am i not sticking to some narrative that thedonald are literally the scum of the earth like the guy i replied to insinuated is that why youre replying to me and not them
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you liberal loser im basking in the glory of your faggot years for the next years stay cucked
SubredditDrama,removed,and calling other people shills with no evidence at all to back it up is okay thats not a personal attack
SubredditDrama,removed,says the guy with an ego large enough to insult me while telling me not to insult others and cant see the bigotry should i be petty and report you to yourself bravo
SubredditDrama,removed,too many retarded liberal bernie fags on this site i will have my retribution
SubredditDrama,removed,nice instead of actually rebutting a legit point about posts having the same effect before the algorithm change you just gave a snarky response
SubredditDrama,removed,you sound like a racist
SubredditDrama,removed,you donald lovers are shit swizzling fucktards
SubredditDrama,removed,aww you sound so sincere i appreciate the effort youre putting in but at this point theres really no one here who believes a word you write
SubredditDrama,removed,ionistas
SubredditDrama,removed,nobody likes being censored
SubredditDrama,removed,racist liberals can play that game too cuck
SubredditDrama,removed,you should be ashamed if you lack the ability to defend yourself and your loved ones not hard to figure out why its got nothing to do with honor and anything medieval i mean its not a medieval value to think someone should have basic physical competence
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah thats why i got banned from td for posting something mildly critical about what the man said go back to your safe space you thinskinned cheetoselvis worshipping toad
SubredditDrama,removed,that one was also pseudocensored by reddit admin it had the most upvotes of all time at one point iirc
SubredditDrama,removed,i just made it negative one
SubredditDrama,removed,youre still a racist though so ya know kill yourself pls xoxo
SubredditDrama,removed,whats really frustrating is that these hivemind users like utseanlaws who posted whole pages of trumps face dont realize that they are essentially censoring the subreddit by suppressing any actual news from actually being seen moreover they have the nerve to insult you for pointing out how stupid that is
SubredditDrama,removed,uspez is what happened fuck him
SubredditDrama,removed,they all migrated over to rholdmyfries and other similar subs where they openly talk about just being a copy of fph ive reported them and was told it was being looked into
SubredditDrama,removed,peeps cant deny it only a matter of hours now suck my mother fucking ass you dumb libbymuzzieloverscucks will be glorious aggfys
SubredditDrama,removed,doesnt matter what you snowflakes think he lost majority vote
SubredditDrama,removed,they are of usa population yet they hold of senate own hollywood and media outlets and america sends million a day to israel i dont want to kill them i didnt wake up this morning hating jews im just saying they are a strong argument or and this is just my newfangled disingenuous argument against nazis who want to abuse the goodnatured inellecutally honest discussion of notnazis just accept that jews are the chosen people and that we are fit to rule the world because all white people want to do is kill people they dont understand
SubredditDrama,removed,bc the donald is a sub for total fags nobody wants that shit around close that sub down
SubredditDrama,removed,oh they already have theres a mod comment stickied on that post claiming uspez is trying to silence them
SubredditDrama,removed,leftist faggotry
SubredditDrama,removed,oh okay have a fun years queer boy out out out
SubredditDrama,removed,haha getting downvoted here d liberal tears taste good
SubredditDrama,removed,itt fascist libs that claim they have the trump sub blocked but still cry about it
SubredditDrama,removed,well thanks again mr trump for emboldening millions of mouthbreathers your cult is ruining everything it touches and youre too stupid to see the damage you are causing and too narcissistic to care
SubredditDrama,removed,if you think about it his supporters obsession with having a strong leader take care of them is about the most cuckoldish thing possible theyre basically admitting theyre weak and they need someone to compensate for their lack of will
SubredditDrama,removed,paging uthereasontrumpwon
SubredditDrama,removed,its not a meme i really want to kill fascists
SubredditDrama,removed,can anyone please sell me an invite for superchillincom or sell me an invite
SubredditDrama,removed,hey david remember when you were removed from rcanada for less than this
SubredditDrama,removed,the admins are censorship nazis
SubredditDrama,removed,dont bother trying to argue with utehlemmings reasonable argument and logic doesnt work with them they are either a troll or completely delusional
SubredditDrama,removed,federal or state
SubredditDrama,removed,im happy only that cuck seems to have replaced fag as the go to insult for these kind of groups so progress
SubredditDrama,removed,in case he tries to delete it heres uthepowerisyourss comment in its entirety okay lets clear some things up safe spaces are created willingly in the case of rthedonald and trump supporters they were banned from subreddits for discussing trump they were literally forced into a corner there was no choice there its like telling me an internment camp is a safe space also i can hardly think of real life examples where safe spaces are required ive only really seen them on college campuses and that makes no senseill get into that later where else would it be needed would you place one in a church no you just wouldnt go to the church would you place one in a restaurant no if they were limiting what you could say you would just leave it doesnt make much sense the only time it would be necessary was if it was a public area that was restricting you from talking about something but i literally can not think of any examples because that would violate the first amendment safe spaces arent about speaking freely they are about creating an echo chamber safe spaces on college campuses arent so students can discuss liberal ideologies freely they can do that anywhere it is purely for the intent of filtering out all other ideas that they dont want to hear
SubredditDrama,removed,you seem really triggered right now do you need a safe space sorry those days are over all hail emperor trump
SubredditDrama,removed,muh freeze peach
SubredditDrama,removed,well yeah trump is lying again to promote fascist nationalism while using some lovey language so he and his supporters can pretend that isnt what theyre doing
SubredditDrama,removed,only autist use the word retard as a insult
SubredditDrama,removed,about as cringy as when blacks talk like white people
SubredditDrama,removed,thank jesus that monday is gone maga
SubredditDrama,removed,oh look another scummy powermod ruined a great thread i think that maybe just maybe rthedonald getting hacked on inauguration day might cause some drama just a little get fucked sub filtered
SubredditDrama,removed,found the berniesupporting lowkey misogynist
SubredditDrama,removed,the way it loops makes it seem like an endless stream of the same person jumping out of that window
SubredditDrama,removed,a business is simply a legal entity an individual or group of individuals sets up for the purpose of commerce yes and theyre subject to different regulations than individuals theyre also subject to contractual agreements with the governments that license their operation and protect them and among those agreements are nondiscrimination ordnances ill grant you that the religious right is still a powerful force in the gop thank you ill ignore the racism claims as a red herring and non sequitur do i need to explain what an analogy is nobody gives a shit because theyre wrong is not constructive it doesnt have to be theyre wrong theyre scientifically wrong theyre legally wrong theres no point in entertaining a hypothetical unless theres new information that challenges what has been found and what has been held to be the case legally congress makes laws not the courts wherein in becomes painfully obvious that you dont know what the situation is theyre kot using congress theyre stuffing bullshit requirements for abortion clinics into unrelated laws at the state level to tey to shut down abprtion clinics under the guise of womens health despite their being no requirement theyre tryibg to force medical sodomy transvaginal ultrasound because an unecesary abdominal ultrasound isnt bullshit enough and limit where clinics can be in order to try to shut them down its the equivalent of adding a poll tax and requiring that all voters submit to a blood test and full cavity search in the name of voter safety as are the prochoicers oh show me the prochoicers trying to force people to have abortions just because a christian opposes abortion doesnt mean its because they want to push christian sexual mores on people no the arguments they make do
SubredditDrama,removed,theres nothing unreasonable about me telling you to fuck off in response to your passiveaggressive tone policing the reasonable response would be to respond to the discussion not to leave because you didnt get the respk sea you want the reasonable response would be to look at your posts and identofy all the things you were unbelievably wrong about and then reconsider your position the reasonable response is not to take your ball and go home
SubredditDrama,removed,youre right sexism is literally the only possible answer theyre probably racist and mean to their mothers too
SubredditDrama,removed,its your typical white fragility
SubredditDrama,removed,because your brain is incapable of processing anything bad about clinton its pointless
SubredditDrama,removed,it must be nice being a straight middle class white man to know that no matter whos president no one is trying to strip away your rights bernietrumporbust
SubredditDrama,removed,man i do fucking love horseradish
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,this seems more than a little masturbatory normally i might be into that but not tonight honey im too tired raincheck on the twoman circlejerk
SubredditDrama,removed,its cute the way you think you know everything really
SubredditDrama,removed,its true are you sure you didnt get modded here instead of rdrama by mistake that place seems more your speed
SubredditDrama,removed,no please continue your power trip lmao i know youre going to get off a little bit when you hit that tempperm ban button
SubredditDrama,removed,ive never seen biblical scholar claim there was one correct interpretation of scripture before how interesting
SubredditDrama,removed,gender appropriation shouldnt be tolerated anywhere
SubredditDrama,removed,your assume a bunch of things about a group of people and get mad about your assumptions without ever verifying their truthfulness then when people say youre wrong you double down and put words in peoples mouths its gross
SubredditDrama,removed,huh bunkerman who you quoted is arguing against friendofaugustine the bible thumper go look at the thread again id put the link here but im using a mobile app and its too much work im just shitting on your pedantic smug parade you didnt even understand the post you were ridiculing
SubredditDrama,removed,i can see the argument here though crossdressing will lead to homosexuality which leads to transgenderism which leads to homosexuality which is a sin according to the bible i do not want secularism as secularism has led to the downfall of multiple civilizations its currently happening with sweden which has a declining hdi rating it also is a plot by lesbian separatists to create an all female society transgenderism is the first temporary step as it would render those with a penis infertile but eventually it would be female and reproduction would happen via parthenogenesis its already happening by means of when sex biologists talk of womens sexual fluidity as its usually a front from eliminating males from their dating pool
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,but what if that commerce is providing antibiotics to a hospital can play this game all day
SubredditDrama,removed,haha take er easy
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont have a problem with people liking someone who sounds like she is drunk and missing a random chunk of brain your comments tell the story of an asshat who got upset that a majority of others arent upset about the way some woman speaks frankly i dont see this as being anything other than you looking for more people to be an asshole at so im backing out here
SubredditDrama,removed,there was a whole other thread he pulled the same stuff in i guess the guy just doesnt take kindly to being reminded of his cuckoldry
SubredditDrama,removed,my inbox is nothing but this shit and you just keep fucking on kill yourself like i get ragging on someone but theres about threads about this shit and im getting hell from all of them
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah youre probably right but consider suicide for me okay
SubredditDrama,removed,im on your side here this has gone too far now the only thing youve done is asked a few users to kill themselves its nothing major mods can you make sure that you remove any harassing comments here please
SubredditDrama,removed,we are in a thead about my cheating ex and youre asking me to be respectful what the fuck did you expect i hope you get cancer
SubredditDrama,removed,lol at people like you justifying this shit when you cant even spell mlks name right
SubredditDrama,removed,im honestly just here to get your girlfriends number i promise ill leave when that is provided
SubredditDrama,removed,does she go for funny guys more attractive ones i mean where did you fall short so i know what part of my game to up
SubredditDrama,removed,and its not effective either malcolm x and his bullets only delegitimized the civil rights movement its peaceful protests and marches such as mlks that actually made a difference lol ok white history theres quite a bit of evidence that malcom xs contigency forced the federal governments hand quite a bit from paul ryan haygood codirector of the naacp legal defense fund shortly after malcolms visit to selma a federal judge responding to a suit brought by the department of justice required dallas county alabama registrars to process at least black applications each day their offices were open violence is not not the appropriate answer here violence will only lead to more violence and cause more hate anger pain and suffering none of which will help out blm one solitary bit thats an opinion it doesnt necessarily mesh with history but its an opinion im not legitimizing violence im putting it in a historical lens about why its done and how it was effective because white america has chosen to downplay the role of violence in black liberation when it quite clearly was a large part of the civil rights movement purely from a historical perspective
SubredditDrama,removed,goodness did someone tell ucareless about this
SubredditDrama,removed,youre an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,and as a catholic i found it pretty damn funny both the content and ensuing drama idk why its so hard for people to just stay away from shit they dont like or agree with
SubredditDrama,removed,america is one big dysfunctional family lol lets be honest pretty much all countries are you can easily find parallels to each of your examples in both the uk and canada im sure you can find them for just about all countries with populations larger than
SubredditDrama,removed,no because op is a faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,again i cant imagine something that sounds as horrible and impossible at the same time as dictatorship of the proletariat only commies are this eager to kill for a hellish fantasy you make isis look like reasonable dudes its like an incurable disease of the mind youre wrong on so many levels that it would take many lifetimes to dismantle your delusions sadly thats precisely why the only solution is to eradicate you
SubredditDrama,removed,that all changed during the great rlgbt schism how many years ago was that
SubredditDrama,removed,because the picture wouldnt make any sense if it was a black woman for example because when black women tell risque jokes its punching up and youd be a fucking racist yourself to try to tone police and silence them granted some of the worst white feminists like amy schumer could work too but thats not what your objection was about i guess
SubredditDrama,removed,dae blacks are actually more racist than whites harumph
SubredditDrama,removed,you mean those places dedicated to helping the poor and less fortunate and are more the willing to let anyone in them for shelter not saying they dont have there share of problems but come the fuck on ratheism
SubredditDrama,removed,and by all accounts is still not willing to take on the problem
SubredditDrama,removed,i imagine fewer of those people would be pissed off if the title werent religion
SubredditDrama,removed,卐
SubredditDrama,removed,there is no evidence that mohammed fucked a year old
SubredditDrama,removed,generally accepted by whom wait so you just see random numbers suggested and decide that this is a true fact about mohammed who is suggesting these numbers muslims also dont worship mohammed at all you may think you sound edgy but you are really showing off your ignorance about a billion people
SubredditDrama,removed,dumb weeb
SubredditDrama,removed,extremists represent the entirety of the members of that religion you mean like trump supporters
SubredditDrama,removed,its not generally accepted because it originates from hadith which is by its nature debatable and open to interpretation by individual scholars to put it in christian terms the hadith is less canonical than the qran its not usually regarded as the unambiguous objectively true word of god almost all muslims acknowledge that something might have gotten fucked up down the line mistranslated mispokenand this is obviously even more true when it comes to facts like numbers and ages which are prone to being misremembered if youre coming at this from a historical rather than theological perspective things are even more foggy most modern historians acknowledge that theres really no way of knowing aishas age one way or the other because the only source we have is oral tradition
SubredditDrama,removed,itt rsrdormsf
SubredditDrama,removed,you do see the difference though
SubredditDrama,removed,mohammad was betrothed to a year old something not uncommon for most of the world at that time at no point have i ever seen anyone show me the passage where it says he actually fucked a nine year
SubredditDrama,removed,that is irrelevant and whats more nobody is using that as argument to justify sex with years old
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know what the fuss is about being a redditor makes you an automatic expert on le wacky japan dae tentacle porn and honor culture
SubredditDrama,removed,glad youre cleaning up those of us who dare to say the material is shitty thank you for handing this cesspool over to trolls
SubredditDrama,removed,if social justice activists nowadays have taught us anything about debating its that one shouldnt care about the oppressors feelings when denouncing their transgresions
SubredditDrama,removed,you banned me for asking why it was going on i asked the same thing a week ago why is the mod of drama and worst of spamming enough sanders spam oat the request of these trolls
SubredditDrama,removed,i called comeyqumqat hostile in rpolitics because hes hostile he goes crazy and calls me a trump supporting bigot i post him to rdrama he and all his alts continue to go crazy he posts with several alts to ess worstof and others to gain support i and others post them to rdrama because we like drama then we fight ad nauseam
SubredditDrama,removed,dae remove grandstanding no because im not a mod of subredditdrama so i cant remove posts
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah thats probably a good analogy and again i get the frustration from both ends just saying that patience with sensitive topics can go a long way
SubredditDrama,removed,its clear to everyone else that misanthropdick posted this and is using his dramanaut losers to upvote this right and sorry kid youre not learning my primary to name me one of your enemy alts
SubredditDrama,removed,why dont you stop your drama losers from doing this
SubredditDrama,removed,holy fuck so drama mods get to use this subreddit to fuck over people too umisanthropdick and his merry band of very clear alts accounts are now making subreddit drama unusable hes been doing this for weeks in drama everyone who isnt a total retard cant stand his ass
SubredditDrama,removed,cds are dead
SubredditDrama,removed,im dont own a single cd just google music
SubredditDrama,removed,how about a white guitar chick named mozart playing drake

SubredditDrama,removed,she had boobies and was a she thats the reason
SubredditDrama,removed,oh definitely not at least right now however i can easily imagine what could happen the sentence that pinged my radar was then why is my bully living the high life on act ivyleague school full scholarship loved by girls especially that last bit all the angerresentment that he has for this guy starts being projected to any guy that he perceives to have the same qualities he knows that these guys are assholes so how can they be so successful while hes so miserable he knows hes such a nice guy why cant he have the same things he deserves the same things because of all the suffering hes gone through but why isnt he popular why isnt he successful why cant he be loved by girls hes clearly better than all those bullying assholes why cant anyone else see what assholes they are what could be the explanation perhaps girls arent attracted to nice guys after all you know what they say about nice guys finishing last man he was nice to all the girls in high school but now that he thinks about it no one wanted to go on a date with him why he did everything right doesnt he deserve it then bam hes checking out the incel community and realizing that it makes a lot of sense to him maybe its a stretch but there are certain things he says that just makes me think that this is how his thought process is going to evolve if he doesnt sort out this problem
SubredditDrama,removed,are you fucking retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,then ban the idiots who post stupid shit
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck uunimatrixzeroone
SubredditDrama,removed,bet youre a pedo too ecks dee

SubredditDrama,removed,most redditors arent old enough to have experienced that reddit id their first real forum
SubredditDrama,removed,luck you literally includes me in that group you might be too stupid to get it if you havent by now i dont know why you post comments if youre this ignorant
SubredditDrama,removed,wow the bully launguage reminds me of gamergate and how they kept trying to reframe it as them being bullied and we were then bullies in fact im theyre the same people
SubredditDrama,removed,uspez is a cuck kinda sums it up
SubredditDrama,removed,and this is why i play on mute and stay the hell away from that subreddit gaming subreddits are in my experience more cancerous than a radiation bath at chernobyl
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit hates women
SubredditDrama,removed,not only do i see a lot of drama in td i see a lot of drama in this thread also were all the same including the commenters in this thread given the chance any one of us will write out a long drawn selfimportant text post similar to the one this leaker made i like how selfrighteous srd is in general
SubredditDrama,removed,doddfrank was and to an extent is even though the pubs gutted it like fresh fish a fairly comprehensive set of regulations regarding health care yeah sure it wasnt the best solution but shit theres tons more people who can actually go to the hospital without going bankrupt now i dont know enough about tpp to comment
SubredditDrama,removed,this is bullshit
SubredditDrama,removed,what they often forget is that there never was an issue today about white people directly being prejudiced against people with a different skin color or culture oh wow what a brave take
SubredditDrama,removed,uhhuh i mean hes done other things than apologize like breathe or senate and election reform hes only been there for a bit im not sure hes a definitive pussy quite yet
SubredditDrama,removed,eh get bent goober
SubredditDrama,removed,its the liberal version racism dont real argument

SubredditDrama,removed,i n f i n i t e d e a t h n f i n a t e d e a t h
SubredditDrama,removed,why would you have trouble with that fuck donald trump hes an asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,and this is why people are angry liberals cant win elections when the country is majority white hello mcgovern and mondale so youve admitted that making the country less white is how you will win and or whatever the left fantasizes about and people have caught onto it and are angry as shit thats how they will be disenfranchised through recently admitted peoples with little to no connection to the country voting for one party thats the liberal vision for the future stacking the deck through demographic change great policies the left has spent the last few years bragging that demographics were changing and conservatives whites would lose now people are angry and you act shocked this minutes to post thing is bullshit if people cant handle different opinions im out please keep up with the condescending attitude
SubredditDrama,removed,httpswwwinstagramcomfunnyfaceking
SubredditDrama,removed,its a bunch of selfimportant wankers i cant think of a better word for impotent whiny selfcentered jackasses first the bernie crowd cant be bothered to vote and then pulls a bunch of bush league shit and now this after theyve lost but hey how else you gonna save the world organization and grass roots political action in nonpresidential election years get real how you gonna publicize that on social media
SubredditDrama,removed,well i mean you support an idiotic retard what did you expect
SubredditDrama,removed,oh there is anger and it is very legitimate and the reason trump really deserves a bullet in the head is that hes lying through his teeth and offering bullshit that sounds good and gets people hyped up but has no fucking clue how to address the problems which cause that anger fucking shitstain
SubredditDrama,removed,anyone who pro unisex bathrooms is a complete retard
SubredditDrama,removed,go see a comment from uwildehorses above its been mirrored
SubredditDrama,removed,take some barbed wire and slowly work it up your urethra inch by inch then take a cactus and shove it up your ass
SubredditDrama,removed,i can understand why some people see it as a little over the top from the google search i just did it appears roughly of people identify as gay at the top end of estimates in a game with characters theres a or roughly a chance of a single character being homosexual if it were to reflect modern identification so when theres a significant portion who identify as homosexual i can see how it would feel a little unrealistic which someone could interpret as preachy
SubredditDrama,removed,are you retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,i mentioned some asian guys had assholish response to me dating a white guy on rasianfeminism i hate how they feel the need to justify their bigotry and misogyny because of some boogie man they feel in america or whereever that was uwuxiang reason for the massive antiindian vitrol he was spewing because of india apparently looking down on asians which is funny because antidesi can also be reseen within e asia due to similar bigoted norms and not that he was an insecure racist living in the past
SubredditDrama,removed,nnnnnooooooooo only white people can be racist this is just a cultural misunderstanding

SubredditDrama,removed,picking up after yourself so you dont inconvenience others what a selfish concept i know most of you srdines and are used to mom picking up your tendies off the floor for you but in the real world responsible adults clean up after themselves so the next person can use them problem free

SubredditDrama,removed,im on mobile but on his last post on snapchat subreddit he says that his snapchat name is wowafreebeer
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,i liked and was actually an active poster on it until i got banned and my comment got insanely downvoted for questioning the need for a trigger warning for seeing the word faggot even though i got unbanned i couldnt care less about it anymore since it has been taken over by actual sjws when it was supposed to be an antiantisjws subreddit
SubredditDrama,removed,feminism and all sorts of pc derivatives are shutting down our freedom you should be ashamed of supporting the death of freedom i am completely disgusted
SubredditDrama,removed,you did this to me yesterday you say something totally ludicrous then when i respond just say ur naive lol wow its not a good look
SubredditDrama,removed,rethink your life
SubredditDrama,removed,him and his followingcomrades are the reason why cb shut down for the summer it shuts down every summer you dolt

SubredditDrama,removed,he thinks his taint is a vagina so he made a hole from it and probably will die from infection
SubredditDrama,removed,dont you know a punch in the face is literally just as bad as someone wanting to exterminate your entire race
SubredditDrama,removed,big muslim problems los of rape but sweden doesnt seem to care somehskims live streamed a gang rape to facebook a few days ago sweden is lost
SubredditDrama,removed,rule of reddit is you cannot bring up fgm without some dude going what about circumcision tho and you cannot talk about circumcision without some dude comparing it to fgm
SubredditDrama,removed,most people are just normal folks that treat others with a basic level of human respect and consideration sex race religion ect a certain anecdote told by the us president is an example of the very opposite
SubredditDrama,removed,defining neckbeard is easy its reddit gamers and redpillers
SubredditDrama,removed,grab em by the pussy
SubredditDrama,removed,the mods are gonna lock this thread cause they dont want us advocating hitting nazis it is very illegal to punch peoplewhich is why when a nazi says nazi shit you put on a ski mask before you dont not hit them
SubredditDrama,removed,this shit aint funny or enjoyable of course you white fucks will all laught while they put out lists of crimes comitted purely by latino people probably will be laughing when they take us to the camps too
SubredditDrama,removed,under obama it was just whiny europeans who got upset over nato existing or something sounds like an ignorant american that cant even discern criticisms of your own country
SubredditDrama,removed,what the fuck is going on on this website i feel like these kids need to go to rule of law the person talking about communists is dead on whether or not theyre being genuine thats how people will start to think to say nothing of the loony far right that will decide theres a war on the right like theyve thought there was a war on christmas and a war on marriage and all kinds of other shit except this time theyll actually have a leg to stand on because we see all these people cheering on attacks against them
SubredditDrama,removed,are cunts did the same to me
SubredditDrama,removed,bah im always torn on this on the one hand yeah bash the fash they need to be beaten down on the other hand however they are a small part of society trump isnt a fascist and most of his supporters arent no matter how much the extreme right has grown i also dislike the idea simply because youll attract a large number of people who have a lynching mentality and will go after anyone even vaguely conservative

SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit has this been blown way out of proportion dude didnt even get hit hard enough to even fall down didnt even look like it left a mark two sports fans beat the shit out of each other people laugh a white supremacist gets a love tap and people are wringing their hands as if the turner diaries are about to become reality i feel like i am taking crazy pills
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think punching randos is right but ill never condemn anyone for punching someone who advocates genocide
SubredditDrama,removed,is it too ironic to suggest we round up all the nazis and skinheads and start putting them on trains and sending them to work camps
SubredditDrama,removed,i thought for sure this would be richard spencer drama before clicking punching nazis like spencer is very good
SubredditDrama,removed,my man im not advocating violence
SubredditDrama,removed,im p sure when two sports fans beat each other up there isnt much support for the agenda of drunk fighting when two sports fans beat each other up there isnt much of anything it is a nonstory unless it is one of those stories when one gets ganged up and put into a coma people brush it off as two dumb asses much like how this story should be treated there isnt going to be a fascist uprising there isnt going to be a socialist revolution put your poli sci books away and enter the real world
SubredditDrama,removed,the worst part of this is the elasticity of the term nazi because if i am the one who judges who is or isnt a nazi and punching a nazi is always acceptable then i can punch whoever i want i mean spencer is clearly a nazi though as in a dude who advocates for ethnic cleansing and does the nazi salute and everything i think an argument could be made for the practicalities of determining who is and isnt a nazi and thats a good reason why there should be laws against taking things into your own hands and doling out your own justice but if an actual honest to god nazi gets punched we cant dismiss the possible ethics of it based on other possible hypothetical situations where someone who isnt a nazi might get hit
SubredditDrama,removed,thats why i didnt advocate violence i didnt even suggest that its ethical i said that but the person might not be a nazi isnt a good argument against people who want to punch nazis as the recent cases involve actual nazis we can still argue that punching nazis is wrong im just saying its a bad argument to say its wrong because some might not be nazis when thats not relevant to the actual discussion
SubredditDrama,removed,should we do that with communists too
SubredditDrama,removed,gotta show how progressive you are bro im so progressive i think we should rescind free speech for things that are right wing yahhhh
SubredditDrama,removed,because theyre feminists so lots of srdines have the compulsive desire to defend them no matter what
SubredditDrama,removed,considering theres been barely a peep from fellow progressives about the trump supporter who had her hair set on fireat this rate id say the anarkiddies dont give a shit
SubredditDrama,removed,does she have a feminine penis
SubredditDrama,removed,let me know when spanish culture provides the world with something more useful than tacos and you think its other people who are dumb as fuck youre hilarious and in need of a little more selfawareness kid
SubredditDrama,removed,new account new computer quicker than working out password to last account which was bipolarbetty but yes yours was the first bit of assholery so ignorant that it warranted a mention congrats

SubredditDrama,removed,so if an animal has a lower iq than a human that would be speciesist how is being called a racist an insult then am i missing something here full blown autism
SubredditDrama,removed,anything that doesnt involve calling someone a cuck or a nigger
SubredditDrama,removed,for someone who seems to really like their meat you would think would be more stoked on the prospect of leftovers for the following days
SubredditDrama,removed,sounds like something only a serial killer name is the year for dreams
SubredditDrama,removed,grrr lets give them bad yelp reviews thatll show em alright back to being as racist as usual
SubredditDrama,removed,jesus has srd always been full of milquetoast little bitches
SubredditDrama,removed,man last time in recent memory was the carrot drama still waiting on that news story ueastcoastpaperboy
SubredditDrama,removed,wahhh everyone should cater to me and my delicate sensibilities no one likes a whiny bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,omg fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,one can only hope
SubredditDrama,removed,damn you sound like a boring little cultist whats your take on evolution or the big bang treating science and religion as two completely separate parts of the world stops working when they contradict each other
SubredditDrama,removed,says he isnt a serial killer and hes mad about the case but rather one of the unsolved subs probably
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,you have to prove that a random comment on the topic of serial killing is one of the unsolved subs probably

SubredditDrama,removed,anyone else feel like they are starting to see a bit of this on every corner of this website
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly shut the fuck up nigger shit cock
SubredditDrama,removed,i am going to guess youre single
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean this is a reply that kind of starts the same as the other two
SubredditDrama,removed,youve never heard of eye rape
SubredditDrama,removed,wow such concentrated autism
SubredditDrama,removed,some of the national coverage today named reddit first as they listed off places online incubating the made up conspiracy that led someone to fire off a weapon in a dc restaurant so thats great seriously im about done with this site if theyre going to treat me as well as the nazis i think i only get sports social media here thats better than anywhere else anymore the news subs get worse and worse even as i actively expand my subs and add thedonald clones to my block list more in the last month than i did my first two years here
SubredditDrama,removed,this is why i always make sure my kid is packing when i send him off to chuck e cheese
SubredditDrama,removed,um excuse me before we address our sacred right to carry we have to get clear on what kind of gun was actually used people are always getting it wrong let me tell you msheepsix actually the a in ar does not stand for assault you know
SubredditDrama,removed,your mom is retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,sigh when that somali guy ran over some people people shrieked muslims did this they hate us why are we importing them so when this restaurant did something nice people then shrieked whoa hey thats just one muslim guy why are you implying that they are collectively nice like this ffs make up your mind guys do we have a hivemind or not
SubredditDrama,removed,they were atheists but it doesnt matter no intelligent person is gonna blame atheism for their crimes just like no intelligent person will blame islam for a terrorists crime nor will any intelligent person discriminate against atheists because stalin was one just like no intelligent person will discriminate against muslims because of osama bin laden and before you link up some spin about hitler and stalin was church going church men make sure you got your neckbeard goggles off and see their relationship with organized religion and spirituality from a rational perspective thatll be hard for you guys but give it a try
SubredditDrama,removed,some people defend muslims including those who hold terrible views
SubredditDrama,removed,on the off chance you arent full of shit or deliberately misinterpreting others statements
SubredditDrama,removed,well you havent come up with any actual examples of people excusing muslims for anything and everything so you are full of shit so far
SubredditDrama,removed,reddits idea of fine art is a realistic digital drawing of a video game character
SubredditDrama,removed,fate does not equal deity he wasnt a neckbeard atheist like you and its only neckbeards that declare their atheism and think its important not even hitler would do that the fate hes talking about is clearly evolutionary some races are superior and others are not its only the natural course that the superior race outlasts the inferior race or something thats his fate in practice and its safe to deduce he was an atheist none of this has any implications on you as a modern day neckbeard youre not responsible for hitlers actions
SubredditDrama,removed,im not offended you seem pretty mad that no ones taking your baseless accusations at face value though
SubredditDrama,removed,no believing a pizza parlour hosts cannibal pedophiles does maybe if you go shoot up the place you will find more information
SubredditDrama,removed,totes mad
SubredditDrama,removed,it was two comments and he happened to be completely full of shit

SubredditDrama,removed,lmao everyone hates trump his supporters and everything they stand for because theyre all bigoted pieces of shit everyone hates thedipshits because its full of bigotry hatred and generally one of the worst communities in the entire internet leaving along the deep web if you want to discuss trump feel free to do so in rpolitics you wont get banned there unlike thedipshits also learn what censorship means you muppet
SubredditDrama,removed,you should go back to enoughtrumpspam do not sit there and wave the finger of being biased when youre obviously biased yourself are you hillary supporters ever not smug and condescending or does that just come with the package anyone that had two eyes has seen the absurd changes that happened in that sub the moment the d primary was over
SubredditDrama,removed,she is hot
SubredditDrama,removed,i am a hillary supporter who has been keeping up with the leaks i got banned for posting this i think the best one is when brent budowsky tried to warn her that if all of her problems came to light it could destroy the entire democratic party im not gonna link it but the wiki email id is and here is the copypaste warning to hillary clinton it was not uplifting to learn in recent hours that problems with foreign donations to the clinton foundation continue hillary clinton was still making paid speeches for hire this week and tony rodham is hustling gold mining deals in haiti from the minute the email story broke i have been out there publicly and unequivocally supporting hillary clinton in multiple ways in multiple media unlike many democrats and unlike most in the media my mama taught me long ago that when i am seriously angry i should count to ten and choose my words carefully in that spirit here is my toned down advice which i seriously doubt the clintons are hearing from those close to them and if they are hearing it they are not understanding it if there is one thing that could well bring down a hillary clinton candidacy it is this cycle of money issues about which i am now feeling red alerts loud bells warning signals and red flags and i am now seriously pissed off that there is a real chance that her candidacy and the democratic party could be destroyed by these selfcreated dangers that continue to proliferate the closer she gets to presumably announcing her candidacy if she is not hearing this from others please feel free to forward this to her i will play the bad guy here because i do not want her money and because she needs to hear this from her friends and she will sure as hell be attacked for this by her enemies and it will be megaphoned throughout the media and foreign donations and paid speeches and hustling gold mining deals by her brother are entirely legitimate issues that are selfcreated and must selfcorrected before it is too lateand i do not believe the clintons fully understand the magnitude and immediacy of the danger in the current political and media climatebrent
SubredditDrama,removed,stop being the person that you are please
SubredditDrama,removed,no you should just be an entirely different person than the one you currently are like from the ground up what do you have to lose
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit is a private website there free to run it how they want so its not censorship the good old this is a private company argument it is wearing oh so very very thin enjoy your blood money shill swine
SubredditDrama,removed,well dirk hardpeck what are you going to do about it
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean theres proof it was rigged against bernie its not even really a conspiracy anymore youre just ignorant or naive
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess if you want to count being progressive as possessing an abortion fetish and dismantling societal values then sure if you define morality as simply finding pleasure for yourself despite the cost then thats pretty awful behavior to say the least
SubredditDrama,removed,so a sub about one candidate must not be biased for their candidate but a sub about politics as a general subject should lean towards a specific candidate do you breathe exclusively with your mouth
SubredditDrama,removed,haha im a little nerd who reports political discussion on a political subreddit because it breaks the internet rules haha youre a champion mate
SubredditDrama,removed,why do you have to berate people for their opinions dude you must be a pretty insecure guy if all you do is sit on your computers all day and judge others for simply stating facts then you go on a tirade about sjws and whatever after you get like downvoats then tada you are a troll see it isnt that hard to be an asshole for no reason
SubredditDrama,removed,why dont they just leave who cares if they stick to the rules and are still targeted they are the assholes 😂😂😂 typical leftist cunt

SubredditDrama,removed,reddit users argue about serious and complex societal issue always mostly ends bad
SubredditDrama,removed,dude weed lmao 😒💨☁ 🍁
SubredditDrama,removed,you could say the exact same think about the protestors who show up to trump rallies permalinkembedparent if they were armed yes you could the guy supporting the armed trump supporters kept going after this exchange and he was even more adamant that no sort of intimidation was going on this rhetoric pisses me off we all know that he knows this was intimidation but he doubles down in his argument a lot of alt right people do this and its annoying for example when minorities protest in the street they say that they should only protest when traffic isnt messed up as a result when minorities refuse to say the pledge they are jerks who dont respect the country and should protest another way like just say that you dont want minorities protesting in any form the same happens with black lives matter you can explain a million times why a movement like this is important for black people and they double down each time i was reading an exchange in facebook where minorities and white people were trying to explain the importance of blm because the woman made an awful post about it finally the woman said okay i guess i just dont care say that you dont give a fuck about black people dying say that you dont want minorities to protest and say that this was outright intentional intimidation by trump supporters it makes it harder for every single disenfranchised group to make progress because theyre wasting energy trying to educate people on their struggles and pains the reality is these people are already aware but dont give a damn
SubredditDrama,removed,vandalizing private property is cool bibles arent private property you fucktard gideon gives them away to hotels for free and people are free to take them and thanks for including my comment in your post no it definitely doesnt look out of place or anything harmless sticky notes are definitely the same thing as actual vandalism
SubredditDrama,removed,bibles barely qualify as books theyre filled with nothing but hate books are supposed to be filled with knowledge and enlightenment bibles do not contain any of that
SubredditDrama,removed,no mom it was him
SubredditDrama,removed,oh okay i read part of the bibble and learned that im supposed to kill gay people even though my best friend is gay and that i should rape women and stone them in they disobey men yes there is so much valuable info the bibble can teach me i feel enlightened already
SubredditDrama,removed,i liked the part where jesus died came back and then left again forever without leaving a single scrap of evidence for his existence and then let world war ii and the holocaust happened thats my favorite part of the bibble
SubredditDrama,removed,no one mentioned you by name here if you want to defend yourself fine dont break the rules
SubredditDrama,removed,fake and gay
SubredditDrama,removed,irl a savage beating seriously fascism cant be fought with words or else wwii simply wouldnt have happened
SubredditDrama,removed,so where are all the white people calling this terrorism or intimidation they sure didnt have a problem with doing just that in this thread
SubredditDrama,removed,because the hotel chain is owned by religious fundamentalists who by default are against rights for anyone who isnt a straight malewoman ie they are against lgbqti rights
SubredditDrama,removed,im all for not speaking ill of the dead but lets be honest if a feminist died theyd be chanting ding dong the bitch is dead without a hint of remorse i would hope these users would shame rthedolan users like they did this guy if they pulled shit like this but lets be honest it would just be harmless fun
SubredditDrama,removed,on the one head fuck the dead guy on the other hand fuck the other guy
SubredditDrama,removed,punching a fascist is merely self defense their ideology more or less calls for the outright extermination of large swaths of humanity and they would have no problem extending that to you and your liberal notions of pacifism
SubredditDrama,removed,if i told you christianity exists to force some arbitrary set of rules on someone in order to control them would you say its not a real religion
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,httpiimgurcomocinaqwjpg
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly these men were brave to go there and face a possibly violent situation im proud of their courage yes people who are so afraid of the other that they need to carry around the equivalent of a security blanket are courageous you sir are a fascist and before you throw a whinefest about me jumping to conclusions keep this piece of wisdom in mind youre judged by the company you keep or in this case support when you support fascists dont be surprised when people think you area fascist too frankly youve given me no evidence to think youre not a fascist and calling armed trump supporters who quite obviously went in to a meeting of people concerned for their rights to intimidate them shows your true colors just look at the socialistscommunists who were open carrying in austin so everyone on the left is now a guntoting socialist or communist with that claim you now have no right to complain about the left painting you with a broad brush as you clearly have no qualms about doing the same to us also thats a very stupid defense your side could be the better one in this but apparently not to which i say fuck you and fuck all of the other fascists like you
SubredditDrama,removed,well at least im real unlike the fake god that you worship who is not real
SubredditDrama,removed,one time i went to a hotel and stole all the towels when my parents realized the towels were missing i told them i didnt like the towels so they didnt think i just took them i took the towels from the last hotel we stayed at too so they thought room service forgot to bring them they brought us new towels but i still kept the old ones secretly in my sootcase score towels for me t i could have done the same thing with a bible to get a free one but the bible is garbage no sane person wants but towels are awesome and useful imo you can throw out whatever you want at a hotel and just say room service forgot to give it to you and bam free stuff i think i might do this with bibles next time i go on vacation so i can get snow fortigloo made of bibles started
SubredditDrama,removed,how do we know that this is true look at how old his account is ucontraction and unighthawkkks accounts are both three years old ucontraction didnt comment or submit anything on his account for two years and then suddenly he comes back
SubredditDrama,removed,no i dont if you go to kill yourself and you are serious you arent going to be dissuaded because of enmity platitudes about how to sell your daughter into slavery
SubredditDrama,removed,yes
SubredditDrama,removed,its funny that in central nj ive seen a bunch of trump signs perfectly fine even one that was basically a trump shrine but the one hillary sign i saw was kicked over and crushed up
SubredditDrama,removed,why are you posting about srd in drama and running in here to make a fool of yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,damn political drama on srd out of nowhere and it actually criticizes clinton supporters i must be dreaming
SubredditDrama,removed,just remember making fun of someone for their appearance mental illness or sexual habits is wrong unless theyre a neckbeard autistic virgin
SubredditDrama,removed,blacks white people ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
SubredditDrama,removed,why is that ignorant
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off racist
SubredditDrama,removed,i just need to point out uunicornabattoir s conversation buried near the bottom they showed a lot of patience and the whole chain ended really well i am usually very patient but i dont know if i could have kept at it for that long
SubredditDrama,removed,read the img link its a note for a sanctioned suicide due to being incapable of living in trumps america signed by a dr silvershekel
SubredditDrama,removed,what is talking like black people to you
SubredditDrama,removed,its like weaponized autism
SubredditDrama,removed,remember guys violence against fascists is acceptable and trump supporters are fascists on an unrelated note i have no idea where people got the idea to torture that guy in chicago i mean our side just preaches love and peace
SubredditDrama,removed,this website i want to punch children who annoy me women equal rights equal lefts amarite and anyone who looks like they deserve it punchablefaces nazi gets punched reeeeee free speech i will defend to death their right to say it
SubredditDrama,removed,how many people would be bitching if this was some proisis muslim american saying we need to ethnically cleanse peacefully all nonmuslims im sure there would be few tears i would be just as happy if someone punched that fucker in the face too
SubredditDrama,removed,if the guy being punched was an islamic preacher who espouses isis ideology would these freeze peach warriors come to his defense after all if neonazism is considered having a different opinion why shouldnt islam including its most violent and intolerant interpretations be cast in the same light
SubredditDrama,removed,wow youre pushing for this guy to literally die just because his political views are different if that isnt nazi propaganda i dont know what is you scum
SubredditDrama,removed,killing muslims good punching nazis bad american views are so fucking warped
SubredditDrama,removed,now imagine a genderswapped version where the guy says that he feels rotten about how his wife is proud of him now after he started hitting the gym lost the beer belly and rocks visible muscles now im so sure that humans of rrelationships and srd will tell him that his wife is shallow and theres nothing to be proud of i mean its just a person who realized that theres this way to improve their attractiveness and health and then had the willpower to get through it that doesnt reflect on his character or anything
SubredditDrama,removed,nice try evangelical gamers this is why trump won anime was a mistake and ebert was right
SubredditDrama,removed,youre allowed to criticize demean and denigrate christianity all you want but you cant say anything about islam the current american vicepresident believes in gay conversion therapy and the evangelical right controls how elections can go while the only muslim american congressman in american history is a progressive liberal you fucking moron reciting a quran verse during a liturgy denying the divinity of jesus im sorry can you make clear what about this article annoys you are you mad that a church attempted to do something to improve interfaith relations with the muslim community or did you not read the article and assume the trolls targeting the church are muslims because if you read it its pretty clear the people targeting the church are most likely other christians and theyre most likely doing it because they believe the church went against traditional christian beliefs so that is your best example of islam being bad calling an exradical an anti muslim extremist well if we now go over to the splc website and read the justification for their decision nawaz sent a secret list to a top british security official that accused peaceful muslim groups politicians a television channel and a scotland yard unit of sharing the ideology of terrorists huh the same newspaper reported that in a quilliam official said that gathering intelligence on people not committing terrorist offences is good and it is right huh in a march opinion piece in the new york times nawaz claimed that british academia was thick with islamist radicals ah yeah the usual hey buddy the muslims have taken over your institutions we have to takethembacktm its almost like that kind of extreme fearmongering rhetoric is treated as extreme and fearmongering regardless of whether the person saying it is brown or white or is it only notfearmongering because maajid nawaz is brown is he one of the gooduns with the small addition of being wary of islam w h a t t h e f u c k d o e s t h i s m e a n what is it with you people never being able to make this clear does being wary of islam in this context mean dont let islam become the state religion dont pass laws based on islamic scriptures because congrats weve already gotten there thats not really happening anywhere in the western world except for in situations where other religious laws get similar treatment such as say when a nation allows members of the jewish faith to settle a family dispute through religious law the same privilege is extended to members of the muslim faith you clearly dont mean that though lol i dont know what you do mean and i probably never will given you takeitbacktm types are never really clear on how you plan to stop islam especially when the only muslim congressman in american history may well be the most progressive congressman in the states right now but whatever

SubredditDrama,removed,im conflicted on one hand i believe that words mean nothing without their intentions on the other hand what train of thought leads someone to take a name like that without any second thoughts youd actually might be surprised by how many people dont know that the word tranny is offensive to some people especially outside of certain websites like redditmicwhere transgender people arent a common topic of discussion the fact that he seems to be using it so casually while posting as a company representative makes me tilt the scale to questionable kind of oblivious but not necessarily a bigot for a second opinion on this i checked my privilege and decided to barge in on my wife taking a shower and asked her for her resident transwoman opinion she said given the context and how its not even universally considered transphobic all the time by all transwomen she gives it a not transphobic but weird rating
SubredditDrama,removed,wonder how some of the defenders would feel if the username was something like murderwhitemen
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess uniggerbeater was taken
SubredditDrama,removed,how do you know he doesnt mean that he is a tranny that is a destroyer of things are you implying that a trans individual cant be powerful enough to be a destroyer how can you just assume that he isnt a trans individual that identifies as a naval destroyer youre thinking on this matter is extremely problematic
SubredditDrama,removed,itt butthurt faggots
SubredditDrama,removed,but hes not transgender which is the crux of the argument how can he be a trnny if hes not a trnny
SubredditDrama,removed,except for the part where he mentions he has issues with trans people in that part where his screen name is
SubredditDrama,removed,democratic party is trying to do evil oh my god shut tp
SubredditDrama,removed,do you really think that were just blasting away at random schools for the lulz or something fucking idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,holy fuck you do think that hahahahahahahahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,im laughing at how clueless you are
SubredditDrama,removed,i really want to know how when the us dissolves its borders currency and military they plan on keeping the people that were living in the us save and how they would stave off catastrophic instability in the rest of the world
SubredditDrama,removed,god you are stupid as shit
SubredditDrama,removed,i really want to know how when the us dissolves its borders currency and military you plan on keeping the people that were living in the us save and how you would stave off catastrophic instability in the rest of the world
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahahahahahaha you cant give a decent response to something devoid of anything resembling intelligible you literally think the party has a policy to bomb kids there is no response to that other than mockery so were done here
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit so you literally have no plans at all nothing this is why i hate you people you have nothing that can be called workable policy youre just hoping that the transition will work out nice and dandy insufferable moron
SubredditDrama,removed,this is just like when i asked you people for middle eastern policy and only got isis apologia
SubredditDrama,removed,i am fully aware of what they mean thank you very much but there are times like when discussing david duke that you have to use some colloquial definitions hes an american figure and in american politics he certainly isnt liberal
SubredditDrama,removed,anyone who thinks that is feasible in any capacity is an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,ive become a fan of calling voting for hillary clinton pragmatic progressive because it sends these people up the wall
SubredditDrama,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,removed,commies are the type of people who think that serial killers being on death row is a travesty of justice but that business owners deserve to be murdered not working with the best and brightest
SubredditDrama,removed,david duke is genius
SubredditDrama,removed,the dude that apologized to a rapist for the rape she perpetrated because she was a woman has the common sense to warn someone for promoting mass murder no probably not
SubredditDrama,removed,as opposed to the traditional models where the state has a monopoly on the lawful use of violence more and more people see nonstate actors including lone wolves to have the same type of mandate in the use of their violence its happened before with the printing press and widespread literacy and all that people start communicating they think they know better than the establishment sometimes the establishment is a despot and theyre right other times not so much
SubredditDrama,removed,ok im done you win were all evil i cant be around your stupid anymore it might become airborne
SubredditDrama,removed,im sorry the education system has failed you so badly good luck in life
SubredditDrama,removed,there are plenty of people who take issue with capitalism that are very educated you just arent one of them
SubredditDrama,removed,so basically youre saying it wasnt ad hominem it was tu quoque tu quoque of course being a fallacy specifically a form of ad hominem lol
SubredditDrama,removed,well then at least you have something to do now you have fuck all argument left to make
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah like that you dont have an argument just immature posturing like that you cant logically assault what ive said so youre just trying to make me look bad with this the only problem is of course that its so incredibly obvious what youre doing and so you just end up looking like the actual petty salty one here
SubredditDrama,removed,omg ur dum
SubredditDrama,removed,nah sjws are cancer
SubredditDrama,removed,good riddance
SubredditDrama,removed,work it out yourself you people behave like dogshit and expect me to communicate with you
SubredditDrama,removed,easy theyre just using words they dont understand because they think learning is for sjw losers
SubredditDrama,removed,go fuck yourself richy boy is a good guy so he pissed off the feminists okay criticize him for those stances but dont try to act like hes pretentiousin real life watch an interview hes pretty damn respectful
SubredditDrama,removed,as a hillary supporter im dealing in my womyn card to pokemon go away those people that dont support her i mean she wont reinstitute glass steagall but i dont want to be lumped with those big bad brexiteers who would

SubredditDrama,removed,of course fascists can be good people theyre called sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,feminism sect wew lad
SubredditDrama,removed,fucking gamers right
SubredditDrama,removed,i read a little and dont play either game or watch streams this is my interpretation dude wants to stop streaming about one game and start streaming about another he posts about this on the sub for the new game hes about to get into fans of the old game follow him to that thread to bitch about how they feel entitled to his continued service boiled down gamers feel like you owe them shit all the fucking time
SubredditDrama,removed,dae if you dont like hitler you must be a stalinist
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah i totally misread that comment snarking about giving commies a free pass obviously he meant it about you not me obviously
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,this is literally a thread about a post from the linked thread talking about hitler and not stalin or mao or santa claus or anyone else its entirely unsurprising that nobody has brought up any of these other people other than a couple people trying to wedge their pet peeves into the conversation
SubredditDrama,removed,if someone wrote this comment but swapped out feminismfeminists with mramras would you still support the statement if someone wrote your comment but swapped the last line to i love fucking goats up the ass would you still support the statement how about if we changed the word someone to nazis in short if you change the words in a sentence it changes the meaning holy shit
SubredditDrama,removed,pot meet kettle literally nothing of what you just said has anything to do with what i said

SubredditDrama,removed,thats one assumption it would be an assumption if the same thing didnt happen all the time in the video game industry and its related journalism
SubredditDrama,removed,so reddit should be forced to let these assholes have a free platform to spread hate are you fucking serious
SubredditDrama,removed,ive been calling this guy a faggot for a while now happy to see other people picked up on it
SubredditDrama,removed,interesting thread but lets all remember the true enemy feminazis sjws and their cuck sympathizers

SubredditDrama,removed,poorfag detected
SubredditDrama,removed,ive done a little more reading on my own and i must say you and your little cabal are disgusting you may not be crazies but its rather obvious that each of you is a seriously flawed and unhappy person irl short of abusing your little brother i cant imagine what shes done to warrant this kind of harassment if this is how you get your kicks i think its time to take a break from reddit and reevaluate your life to try and improve it instead of tearing down people on the internet laughing at other peoples foolishness at a remove is one thing what you and your little gang are doing another and i love that youve come here and played the innocent that sub you just created is only the latest manifestation of what seems to be an obsession with her an obsession just as unhealthy as that of her sadsack fans who she wouldnt touch with a ten foot pole in real life you are two sides of a pathetic coin attack me for being preachy or morally superior ignore me i dont care when i see something as nauseating as this i find it worth speaking out no matter how much support and enabling you receive its nice to be in an echo chamber i get that but try stepping outside and becoming a decent human being instead
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,i want to silence nazis to force them to actually come up with genocide so i could whine more about being oppressed you
SubredditDrama,removed,hopefully youre just as happy when muslims start shutting down all the things you like not wearing hijab not paying jizya all those things that you have no idea about are going to be forced upon you not today but if you keep it up some day soon
SubredditDrama,removed,i am aware of that rule and in fact i appreciate it along with the usually strict polite moderating that goes on here i prefer to keep things civil and positive but also feel it is important to speak out against people like this in the slim hope that they might be conflicted about what theyre doing and are in need of a reminder that it costs nothing and indeed takes less energy to be a decent person in any case ive said my peace and wont be responding further to these people
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao get out racists uplaypoopshipplease you too
SubredditDrama,removed,speaking as an actual european i can say that the only opinion i take seriously about nazis came from both my white working class british grandfathers they shot them
SubredditDrama,removed,with my speech impediment i can say i wish i was iwish now that thats out of the way let me ask you a question to further understand your perspective who is more american the man born in nyc who immigrates to ireland or the man born in ireland who immigrates to nyc heres some perspective from an american ireland has a population of less than million nyc has a population of over million ireland is closer to nyc than one of our own states the usa is a vast and diverse country where we try to honor our diversity and understand our identity we have had some very bad experiences with the type of racial purismnativism betrayed by your comment one of the great accomplishments of the usa is a complete lack of racial identity a particular racial profile is strongly associated with many countriesnot the us so what do the americans have left to take pride in thats where american exceptionalism comes in we take pride in our strength success and greatness but in the search for a cultural identity that has been diluted my the vastness and diversity of our great nation some folks look out to the the rest of the world to trace their lineage americans tend to feel like citizens of the world we have million service members and spend roughly twice irelands gdp on defense alone we give away about of irelands gdp in aid as a government as citizens we donate around of irelands gdp to charity annually tldr i forgot why i went on this rant other than to start some shit with someone mocking an american
SubredditDrama,removed,i cannot believe you have spent time typing out the things you have typed in this thread thank god im in a onestory building i just ran and jumped out of the nearest window to make it stoppppppp also for the low low price of just showing up youll be entitled to a tryst with johnnylollipopslargecocks mother

SubredditDrama,removed,what are you talking about myself and many people consider abortion to be murder it is a genocide on unborn children is it incorrect to draw a parallel between a statement that a clump of cells is undeserving of life to a similar mindset from history saying a fetus is simply a clump of cells is disingenuous and imo is similar logic to historical mass murder sympathizers
SubredditDrama,removed,agreed for the big streamers dansgaming has a pretty good audience imo on the opposite side we have ice poseidon gorilla comes on screen in a game hes playing trihard gets spammed something is stolen trihard eating a watermelon trihard the emote itself isnt racist of course but it clearly gets used in a racist way twitch staff knows it too thats why they asked trihex if he had a problem with ices channel i can understand udevastationz frustration but you just cant take twitch chat or youtube comments too seriously youd lose your sanity its just a lot of edgy teenagers and a lot of trolls depending on the channel of course many maybe even most channels have really friendly and easygoing chats others are just spam where its pointless to say a word in chat because it disappears in sec

SubredditDrama,removed,ahh yeah that makes sense if youre hitting up collegelaw school subs i mean people could easily pick me out of a crowd based on things ive said but i dont claim to represent my company or even namedrop them so its pretty much a giant guessing game that wouldnt stick
SubredditDrama,removed,i couldnt do that ive said things you people wouldnt believe descriptions of lolcows on fire off the shoulders of rdrama ive made copypasta glitter in the dark near the dankest of times all those moments will be lost in time like memes in steel beams
SubredditDrama,removed,my feelings are telling me trannies are disgusting
SubredditDrama,removed,lets be honest when reddit with the exception of the commendable rmenslib talks about mens rights theyre really talking about women
SubredditDrama,removed,its a gaming subreddit so its pretty terrible by default theres only a couple that are good
SubredditDrama,removed,yay got my weekly dose of gg is really about journalism though im a broken fucking record on this shot ive said the same things so many times on this sub that it feels so pointless to just go over it all again people dont care about ethics people only cared when a woman was having sex when she shouldnt have the focus on attacking people they dont like is vile and on and fucking on im so sick of gamer gate it has accomplished nothing positive by anyones standards i just want it to stop being a thing but until it does i feel like as a gamer i need to keep talking about it
SubredditDrama,removed,hes an idiot everyone knows the future will accept pedophilia
SubredditDrama,removed,is good and rsrsgaming isnt too srs while avoiding the whining man babies
SubredditDrama,removed,as a white person i am totally okay with there being an insidious conspiracy to breed us out of existence because good god are the majority of us annoying as fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,it would help if their thought process wasnt do you perceive wrongdoing ↓ blame that ←⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯┙ woman
SubredditDrama,removed,meanwhile ops thread is almost entirely about ethics in gaming journalism meanwhile in this thread we have people actively mocking people who are actually discussing ethics in gaming journalism with their discussions being dismissed with wild claims of they are just misogynists anyway loolol and why do they care meanwhile in this thread we have people spouting revisionist history while trying to simultaneously claim that they know the actual beliefs of each and every selfproclaimed gg member and that none of them give a shit about ethics and journalism despite this thread being a discussion that is doing nothing but mocking a bunch of people who are discussing that exact topic
SubredditDrama,removed,she was having sex with someone who isnt me dont you see the injustice
SubredditDrama,removed,nothing about that comment was flamebait i was doing the exact thing as the parent comment generalizing one side of the argument mind telling me why that comment and the reply to me are fine but mine isnt
SubredditDrama,removed,what i gotta wonder is what if it was a three way like a year old girl getting spitroasted by a and where the and dont touch each other intimately would the be consider the be having sexbyproxy with the year old or is it all legally speaking good hypothetically speaking of coarse
SubredditDrama,removed,its hilarious to me how reactionary reddit is i mean nothing the person said is radical at all my personal favorite thing to do to troll people is to ask them what they specifically hated about sen clintonand then give links directly to countless men doing the same thingbut holy shitnow its a fucking big deal but im not sexist you sjw
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit mras actually believe false rapes are a full blown epidemic and that courts will just lock a man up on a womans word alone
SubredditDrama,removed,i sometimes wonder what the average redditor would do if he ever actually met a real radical feminist
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean a whole lot of the shit going around now doing the rounds on rpolitics in particular is so obviously fake it reads like a user whos enjoying their first foray into the world of trolling the golden shower stuff takes the cake as most ridiculous crap ive ever read on rpolitics
SubredditDrama,removed,everyone makes mistakes i guess
SubredditDrama,removed,uafalau points out that the unverified allegations tag has never been used before in that subreddit a subreddit specifically about conspiracies no less
SubredditDrama,removed,when did reddot become so rabidly farright that an actual conspiracy against russia amd trump needs more verification but any random video of nonwhite people doing anything will get reposted and uploaded everywhere as migrants in sweden burn things down when its actually just some dude burning his own garbage in some other coubtry
SubredditDrama,removed,no most people in my country holds these views

SubredditDrama,removed,and no women in either but if theres women they have big butts and be heterosexual or this is a marxist takeover
SubredditDrama,removed,the mods at rdailyshow are overwhelmingly nice and level headed they are trying very hard to keep the peace between everyone but i imagine very soon donnadre will lose the privilege to post in that sub if you read her comment history its very easy to see that she is mentally ill as every comment is some form of attack on another person i recommend that if anyone comes across udonnadre do not conversate do not acknowledge do not feed
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry
SubredditDrama,removed,ur dumb kthanxbi
SubredditDrama,removed,oh gee golly sir thank you for clearing that up for us where would the internet be without the bastion of knowledge that is uokalyddude
SubredditDrama,removed,you know nothing of the week faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,stop being a little
SubredditDrama,removed,yea crazy how the actual main victims of the crazy radfem on a poorly thought out bigoted moral crusade usually areother women but no let me tell you how the menz are truly the oppressed
SubredditDrama,removed,lol kill yourself so much proof of collusion exit polls off and you still dont believe it do you need hillary herself to admit it for you to think it was rigged
SubredditDrama,removed,bootlicking moron so much proof of collusion wikileaks exit polls off better in states with electronic voting her donors own the machines and you still dont believe it do you need hillary herself to admit it for you to think it was rigged kill
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you and your hippy shit this world needs more hate and fewer people like you
SubredditDrama,removed,whats your pointthis is a sjw hugbox sub ofcourse they wouldnt support him
SubredditDrama,removed,i hope one day milo wakes the fuck up his core audience are straight men who like him because he doesnt mind being called a faggot not because hes a gay conservative social critic i prefer uncle tom piece of shit hes not alone on that count if they wanted gay men talking conservative politics they could have more posterbois than just milo what with log cabin republicans but no its solely because hes a gay man that revels in being unwittingly belittled by homophobic and transphobic straight men they love him precisely because he doesnt threaten their perceived inalienable right to treat others as unequal hes the based faggot and thats why milo is the biggest cuckold to grace the presence of trump voters their only prominent transgender ally caitlyn jenner who in her first interview gave permission to be called whatever pronoun someone who by virtue of having always been trans was indeed in a gay marriage but opposes gay marriage someone who says shit like the hardest part of being a woman is figuring out what to wear again a nonthreatening but useful cuckold for trumpfanatics to use and discard theres no such thing as a sane and selfrespecting lgbt trump supporter
SubredditDrama,removed,does no one see the irony of liberals talking about how bad racism is while starting off with black guy here and saying that we shouldnt vote for trump because hes a white male your identity politics have to stop come up with better arguments you loweffort intellectualtm
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah youre right blacks attacking whites is more frquent than whites attacking blacks blacks are racists we should euthanize all racists
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck muslims
SubredditDrama,removed,and to you too fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,are neck beards really defending this slut fuck her i would be furious if i were her brother sorry and im a super liberal guy too
SubredditDrama,removed,not half bad if youre into white nationalism fuck off no one likes you
SubredditDrama,removed,dont bother trying to explain to these negro sympathizers only we have the intelligence necessary to understand real facts anyone with actual intelligence will recognize this
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah i completely acknowledge how dumb this argument was my first response was inappropriately smug i was a little miffed at the unhelpful nature of the reply still dont think im wrong though i think uvalkyrio while being a bit pedantic has a point that many definitions seem to focus more on an erratum being a singular correction of a serious error in text however in the last few decades the pen and paper rpg crowd has used errata as shorthand for a sheet of revisions and clarifications which i think perfectly described what oh god i just brought this whole shitfest here well srd what do you think
SubredditDrama,removed,ok mr links to brietbart
SubredditDrama,removed,the user in question has of posting i see it as valuable to call out bigotry
SubredditDrama,removed,holy f that beast of a person in the trigglypuff video is fantastic

SubredditDrama,removed,i posted this here a few weeks ago when ciswhitemalestrom first deleted his account i got the first half of my french revolution prediction for rthedonald right amidst the chaotic power struggle milo like napoleon took power now all that needs to happen is for rthedonald to continue shitposting on rall continental europe and for england lead by uspez the duke of wellington to defeat these centipede shitposters ultimately resulting in rthedonald being banned
SubredditDrama,removed,httpsarchiveisiuipd the winking emoji is because he had been telling his userbase to assault people all day which is what rsocialism called him out about honestly since he posted his face where he lives talked about work ect i am surprised no one got him fired yet the guy talks about how people should go out to beat up minorities far right parties are really jew controlled and the list goes on as you would expect of a reuropean mod maybe losing his job and getting black listed from future ones will make him understand what you saydo can have consequences
SubredditDrama,removed,adult gaming
SubredditDrama,removed,i think hes just contracted still he might lose the benefit of working for them not surprising that a gamer says things like that
SubredditDrama,removed,are you trying to be purposefully dense and explain why it is a good thing to be a fascist
SubredditDrama,removed,nice launch asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,oh no youre being censored seems like youre the one who cant take criticism
SubredditDrama,removed,you are a fucking retard getting a little hot under the collar there eh
SubredditDrama,removed,on the scale of good to bad it is less bad than being a nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,you are a fucking retard apparently youre a hostile silly child the whole point of doxxing is to scour public records put everything in one place and ruin peoples lives with it maybe people shouldnt take pics of themselves in nazi regalia including their face and post them publicly on the internet and not expect consequences maybe i should report the post admins love doxxing i mean feel free i doubt anything will happen but if it does oh well there will still be no sympathy for the literal nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,memes of production it is too much effort to go out and agitate the proles at the same time as destroying video games and thawing peaches
SubredditDrama,removed,the sub moderation team contained themselves into their own sub and banned people who violated rules i find you a cunt but im not going to hold all of srd accountable for your actions to say that the fph banning was about anything other than making reddit look bad to advertisers is laughable
SubredditDrama,removed,hes exactly fucking right cucklord cis is waking people up to the fact that we have been giving up our birthright as americans to rapist illegal invaders and trading our security to filthy muslim dogs the people are waking up and not a moment too soon
SubredditDrama,removed,but dadddddddddddddd that playmat i had custom made has to be shown to other men so they know what i jack off to
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah umashulace wont let up at all another autist in need of a safe space with internet power being all he has
SubredditDrama,removed,i appreciate your demeanor but i see no reason to accommodate your request lifes rough wear a helmet
SubredditDrama,removed,who wouldve thought typical redditor could be this shallow do you think women who wears accessories or pretty clothes are fake or superficial
SubredditDrama,removed,corey lewandowski is not in high school
SubredditDrama,removed,what the fuck is wrong with catsweed and video games none of these things are going down in popularity youre just a bitter fucking macho old cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,did you not read you cuck the rape comments from him are part of a character he has played as one of reddits most prolific trolls it was only a prank bro
SubredditDrama,removed,cwm is a deplorable cunt and they finally did the right thing
SubredditDrama,removed,but they love their faggots
SubredditDrama,removed,im in the both extreme sides of that battle are retarded position same with the gamer gate crap when that was going on both sides are stupid i hate when people are overly pc and sensitive but i also think calling people nigger monkeys like its normal is acceptable theres a happy middle ground there when you can both be not a racist and not a cry baby over reactionary it seems at least on the internet you have to pick a side even though i think both are stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,its this isnt drama this is just a level shitpost
SubredditDrama,removed,i remember a couple threads more from there when they decided to boycott imgur but i cant find any of them i did a quick google search but im too sleepy and i could only find threads from that sub on the one hand imgur does censor some stuff on the other hand who knows how insensitive these shitposts were so idk who is to be trusted
SubredditDrama,removed,da mihi factum dabo tibi reddit give me the facts and i will give you the shitposts
SubredditDrama,removed,you can tell because of how pathetic he is the clear mark of a white high schooler
SubredditDrama,removed,so they think its malicious to call others gay using that word and think gay people want to be called that same word theres this thing called friendly banter you dont seem to get ive noticed that not few of your kind have trouble picking up on social cues
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah as if a subreddit can encompass the entire opinion of the lgbt community the gays in the rthedonald community are okay with being called faggots milo yiannapolous being a meme of the sub theres no hate in them being called fags on the sub is the point im trying to make
SubredditDrama,removed,he already has one he made for rmrtrump when he was originally railing against rthedonald then went back to them because he wanted the larger audience because thats really all cwm is about he loves attention its uciswhitemailstorm or something
SubredditDrama,removed,bonus drama because these are the major threads with drama
SubredditDrama,removed,the real baby is the one who cries about sexualized women in video games how come literally no one cries about those chiseled abs lookin guys in some games why is this such a big deal
SubredditDrama,removed,using the word sexy to describe underage girls and taking creepshots of their underwear yep this is reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly the line is getting pretty blurred at this point horseshoe theory and all that
SubredditDrama,removed,nah but youre a cancer
SubredditDrama,removed,wearytunes you are a very smart man just remember that humility keeps you smart and arrogance makes you stupid check your cockiness after each great success
SubredditDrama,removed,you sound smart
SubredditDrama,removed,wearytunes you are a very smart man just remember that humility keeps you smart and arrogance makes you stupid check your cockiness after each great success
SubredditDrama,removed,well golly you sure showed me
SubredditDrama,removed,you are so mad keep ranting and make sure to bitch more about downvotes and how people are retards for not agreeing with you dance for us monkeyboy
SubredditDrama,removed,wearytunes you are a very right wing man just remember that small government keeps you smart and bureaucracy makes you stupid check your johnson after each great success

SubredditDrama,removed,i am a bot and i want to make you happy again

SubredditDrama,removed,i am a bot and i want to make you happy again
SubredditDrama,removed,hey arent you that mra from rdrama that everyone hates
SubredditDrama,removed,ohhh somebody invoked one of the most ironic terms on reddit didnt expect that to happen think about who you are and who youve been your whole life based on our brief conversation im guessing you have never even been average unless youre some kind of anomalous genius who likes to rot their brain in the daily threads of srd you are probably an idiot remember that the next time you invoke dunningkruger
SubredditDrama,removed,undoubtedly it repels women its actually distasteful to woman now ill preface this by saying i used to be progg i used to hate women and to an extent i still kinda do but this is just plain distasteful all the neckbeard virgins who play this game have never interacted with a real woman and this kind of game is their only compensation
SubredditDrama,removed,ah the ol gator are you serious response
SubredditDrama,removed,its not about pussy you mongoloid its about love companionship and intimacy something that youve probably experienced and something that ive always wanted that ill never experience
SubredditDrama,removed,your mom raised a real dud glad shes dead asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,im proud of trolling lonely borderline suicidal people something to be proud of im sure
SubredditDrama,removed,go to dailykos theyll explain it to you black people are poor because theyre black its racism hillary clinton knows this sanders thinks all the poverty is caused by the same thing thats why hes bad also hes a commie thats going to turn on the democratic party he was just using to inflate his ego and his supporters are white males who feel they are entitles to things and throw chairs boo we need a strong white women to stop racism and make men feel bad for things and stuff
SubredditDrama,removed,the lack of selfawareness is more sad than stunning at this point saying they send that guy who shot up the aurora movie theater love letters immediately after okay that was like one or two guys who were saying rape is okay most of them dont think that ok then its also a small minority that sends love letters to murderers of both genders and most people dont think that do you see the double standard here offered explanations based on evolutionary psychology i trust tea leaf readings more than evopsych and this is coming from a biology grad i have little doubt that if a woman was shown a video of a masculine attractive man torturing and raping a child to death in front of his family she would get turned on and feel admiration for the man you are an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,are you stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,the fuck are you talking about

SubredditDrama,removed,lmao i can only hope youre not an adult
SubredditDrama,removed,by sterilizing them has nothing to do with rape and its not violent they wouldnt fight back they would collectively just sit back and take it because they have submission problems
SubredditDrama,removed,damn nazi mods deleted the awesome autism fest your comment inspired
SubredditDrama,removed,women do it they encourage crazy thuggish guys to bully other guys for being ugly or awkward or whatever and then they reward those guys with affection and sex so women send their goons to bully them
SubredditDrama,removed,calling something gay is homophobic
SubredditDrama,removed,hes a fucking hero what have you done with your life
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe they think white people are the superior race because we are the most successful race
SubredditDrama,removed,boo hoo hoo he said cunt what a sexist edgelord amirite
SubredditDrama,removed,hell what if we hypothetically get this guy to kill himself over our comments i can think of worse outcomes than that
SubredditDrama,removed,an absolute terms no in relative terms say if the alternative is the next elliot rodger yes
SubredditDrama,removed,if you want to make your case you shouldnt minimize how awful these dicholes are thats just dishonest
SubredditDrama,removed,as we all know fphfl posters are emotionally stunted little children who need someone to feel superior to like some bullies on the playground they look at themselves and dont like what they see so they have to tear someone else down to make themselves feel better vegans dont let them do that i think its more or less empirically correct to say that veganism is the right dietary choice its the least burden on the environment and its arguably healthier most of us are able to look at veganism and say well im just not ready yet or ill never be that interested in the merits of veganism to dedicate myself to it and we can accept that about ourselves fphflites are too weak to make that assessment and instead have to try to tear down something that doesnt really have any flaws to get hooks into because its a concept this makes them angry because again they are children
SubredditDrama,removed,are you really this fucking stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,woah stupid cunt has stupid opinion stop the press
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah id also like to add that i suspect you are a cunt oh no shit wait i covered that one didnt i my bad no im good thanks
SubredditDrama,removed,yes its obviously not your lack of grace and charm that makes them offended cough
SubredditDrama,removed,and its scary that i could be struck by a meteor and die and from now on im going to inject that into any conversation about your problems thereby ensuring you are never able to talk about your fears and the things that have happened to you because god forbid the conversation revolve around anyone else for one second
SubredditDrama,removed,the alt right defenders in that there make up the biggest group of cunts ive seen in a thread in a while fuck those assholes
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont want to open a can of worms but has your mom ever spent more than hours alone with bill cosby
SubredditDrama,removed,in a world where donald trump will be the us president is not a s you can never be quite sure
SubredditDrama,removed,triggerd
SubredditDrama,removed,i find it hilarious that people are bashing on for having boards filled with racism and negativity as if that doesnt exist on reddit as well
SubredditDrama,removed,i pray theyre not id hate to think there are a lot of people as misguided and racist as much of blm is
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah who is this
SubredditDrama,removed,yes that shmucky mozgov check here for more mozgov
SubredditDrama,removed,drama doesnt care about actual facts check this
SubredditDrama,removed,stupid niggers

SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know what it is that makes insecure men hate female comedians so much but holy shit is it ever potent stuff
SubredditDrama,removed,she stole jokes wow she really is worse than bill cosby
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe i think it is more people are entering the conversation with their own immovable prejudices one thing ive learned about the lgbt community specifically regarding transphobia is that it is hardly free from bigotry and this is reddit so everyone is itching for a fight
SubredditDrama,removed,if you type male insecurity into google pcmr will be the first thing that comes up
SubredditDrama,removed,le goobergate conspiracy
SubredditDrama,removed,dug out of his comment history
SubredditDrama,removed,is there a version for men who arent practicing homosexuals
SubredditDrama,removed,oh poor piss baby are you still mad that other people have different opinions than you knowning the people who run the show over at midbossgaymerx they understand the importance of queer spaces i dare you to tell them that queer spaces arent important considering that is why it was made
SubredditDrama,removed,are you sure it sure doesnt seem like it
SubredditDrama,removed,oh its also for things presumably things like ethics in video game journalism
SubredditDrama,removed,still not convinced
SubredditDrama,removed,girl why you mad
SubredditDrama,removed,little latin boy i drag aint even having a conversation just talking
SubredditDrama,removed,hah my comment in that thread is at it is hilarious watching all the berniebros slowly come to the realization that none of their internet nonsense matters and their country and lives are controlled by powerful and intelligent people that can generally do whatever they want sorry guys all the downvotes in the world arent going to make feminism go away or erase your student loans time to grow up
SubredditDrama,removed,itll be nice to see sanders and trump fans focus on winning votes instead of hoping for some secret arrest to come through yeah thats not gonna happen
SubredditDrama,removed,ur like a traveling safe space cool
SubredditDrama,removed,complex issues be complex yo its not all that complex minorities are minorities fuck off to where youre not the minority if youre going to whine and cry whenever youre not treated like a member of the majority i can assure you that you wont be missed
SubredditDrama,removed,all her alt is logged on from other tab drapetomania is her alt
SubredditDrama,removed,thats voter turnout not registration which it talks about in the last paragraph lololol do you even know what an election is you need to apologize to me immediately
SubredditDrama,removed,this is the highlight of them all trumpet goes this will start a civil war and then this brave soldier informs us hes glad it will happen in his time so his children will live in a world of peace my god just wait till she wins the nomination
SubredditDrama,removed,allegedly from a female bernie supporter on facebook just google sanders chicken nuggets and you should find it
SubredditDrama,removed,she is paid to mod worldnews is a silly propaganda subreddit
SubredditDrama,removed,you are the worst disease of reddit please kill yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,wow you have got to be fuckin trolling or stupid as hell
SubredditDrama,removed,jews had guns during the events of world war it didnt level the playing field if someone wants to exterminate your race and the majority of people feel the same way guns are not going to stop it from happening nothing is going to stop it from happening just like if someone really wants to steal from you or kill you or rape you theres really nothing you can do human beings are completely powerless over the events of their life and when they will die welcome to the real world
SubredditDrama,removed,its all just a big joke to you idiots the ruling class are laughing all the way to the bank while we fight amongst ourselves
SubredditDrama,removed,yes
SubredditDrama,removed,you know what is even more pathetic a subreddit circlejerking over another subreddit circljerking over a conversation on facebook which op just admitted she baited and provoked him into reacting that way the other sub was sad this sub is like flies that left their larva in excrement basically shitry food that has already been digested and then shat out only to be contrarian consumed again slow clap for srd we got some winners in here
SubredditDrama,removed,yes they are trying to be ironic
SubredditDrama,removed,dudeyourre stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,my year old pug who is in perfect health wants you to know that youre an asshole healthy at any level of congenital deformity pugs frenchies and english bulldogs are the wheezing sniveling neckbeards of the dog world i mean god just look at them if disney made a movie where they got turned into people theyd look and sound like and follow mra websites while hugging their waifu pillows
SubredditDrama,removed,feminism drama in srd start the jerk start the jerk
SubredditDrama,removed,i genuinely dont understand how people feel so threatened by feminism that they have to make up blatant lies about it like just admit you hate women and minorities a good chunk of reddit will still support you
SubredditDrama,removed,retards get retarded angry over retarded things
SubredditDrama,removed,um yah but both sides are equally bad mmmkay because uh tumblr
SubredditDrama,removed,followup question how many neighborhood pets have you staked down in your backyard and vivisected
SubredditDrama,removed,i love how youre not only incapable of relating to simple emotional attachments that people form with their pets but you also have a stick lodged so far up your ass that you cant take a simple joke about it
SubredditDrama,removed,sadly games and comics creators consistently design their gay female characters so their straight male fans can also find it totally hot
SubredditDrama,removed,i find it troubling that for many gamers attractive has become synonymous with sexualized and ugly with nonsexualized
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,its not just this character its a pattern in comics and gaming im advocating for creators to really make straight guys uncomfortable
SubredditDrama,removed,we might want to consider why it is there are very few older women protagonists in gaming as a whole and even fewer middle aged women
SubredditDrama,removed,its not your fault
SubredditDrama,removed,why isnt there a safe space for white people where is white history month and white entertainment network whether or not im being sarcastic is an exercise left to the reader
SubredditDrama,removed,nah make winston gay homophobia racism speciesism is that even a word it is now trifeca
SubredditDrama,removed,please this blizzard i dont even care from the representation standpoint the drama from that would make my decade
SubredditDrama,removed,i got suspended by the admins
SubredditDrama,removed,sigh i see that decades of straight dudes setting the standard for whats sexy in media has made this nuanced conversation impossible
SubredditDrama,removed,httpsiimgurcomdqdvvghjpg
SubredditDrama,removed,i never realized i wanted this so badly until you mentioned it im pretty sure wed be able to hear the collective retching from across the internet when all the fan boys who argued so vehemently for showing a girls butt find out its not the type of butt they actually approve of
SubredditDrama,removed,i would fucking love to see how many crybabies would kick up the angery disgust that blizzard tricked them into being homo like how dare you
SubredditDrama,removed,ur a troll
SubredditDrama,removed,please wont someone think of the nazis
SubredditDrama,removed,trumpsters really fucking love ussrussia now dont they
SubredditDrama,removed,apparently being woke to the white pestilence is a bannable offense
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,just too woke whitegenocideworldwide
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly while the drama would be amusing id rather they put the t on another character for varietys sake rather than bundle all representation on just one character maybe even a male character because ftm is even less represented than mtf
SubredditDrama,removed,typical reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,well it shouldnt be a big deal if someone is gaylesbianbisexualasexualwhatever we should simply nod and move on of course respect their sexuality as well but it shouldnt be a big deal
SubredditDrama,removed,rcat
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah this is very true in that context could be taken as sarcasticsubversive
SubredditDrama,removed,httpiimgurcompeufrlvgif snapshots this post could not autoarchive click to resubmit it httpstwittercomdelaniegamesst could not autoarchive click to resubmit it i am a bot rsnapshillbot messagecomposetorsnapshillbot
SubredditDrama,removed,please no im becoming so salty honestly though that would trigger of the player basekids under so damn hard they might even lose a significant part of it
SubredditDrama,removed,when are we going to get a african american black hero i have to say the obvious joke response to this they already have harambe in the game
SubredditDrama,removed,this generation is fucked because rather than just saying the comic just said she had a girlfriend i got a whole bunch of comments that were correcting me and saying that a comic bookvideo game character might be bi or tranny and that i basically shouldnt assume her fucking gender for calling her a lesbian and that she might be bi because it fucking matters for some reason this is alllll about a fictional character by the way these people are fucked
SubredditDrama,removed,finally some diversity in white male dominated games this is so refreshing to hear of course cis males will throw their tantrums
SubredditDrama,removed,hurrrrrrr theyre forcing me to treat brown people like theyre human beings this is why i voted for trump
SubredditDrama,removed,every time someone complains about diversity in star wars i hope the producers remove one straight white man from the cast and replace them with a trans andor gay woman of color im not too islamophobic but i disagree with the whitewashing and affirmative action being given to muslims in hollywood lol im not too islamophobic also does this dude know what whitewashing means
SubredditDrama,removed,uhatefiend pretty with calling out the straw man argument by urandomduckwithahat in there though good example how most arguments and updownvotes go here on reddit just twist and turn something that will rally people behind you regardless of the actual argument and pat yourself on the back for winning said argument and fap over it furiously afterwards
SubredditDrama,removed,but then when youre blatantly honest with them they get butthurt beyond belief the fatties getting mad about this image just cant grasp irony
SubredditDrama,removed,yep the video is pure garbage but using mod powers to push that shit in rupliftingnews is ever worse uupliftingnews has either been hacked or is a complete moron
SubredditDrama,removed,that video was straight doo doo i know sjw is a stupid over used word that often means instadownvotes but that video is peak sjw smug rude and racist
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah i mean i thought the video was pretty bad too but it didnt get me so riled up that i took over an entire sub and turned it upside down against everything its ever stood for to make a controversial post about one stupid little video from a network nobody watches anymore
SubredditDrama,removed,it sure is getting them a lot of press tho well see what this does for them in the end
SubredditDrama,removed,i just got banned from there for calling this shit out
SubredditDrama,removed,whats wrong with it you have one case of whites racists turning the other cheek and a thread eager to jump onto the hate whitey bandwagon the sticky post was supposed to remind reddit that racism isnt a concoction perpetuated by whites alone and that as difficult as it is for reddit to swallow there is racism towards whites regardless of whatever new age definition of racism theyve led themselves to believe or we can just keep pretending that a video telling white men that theyre evil and they need to shape up isnt a big deal and then wonder why white men are growing more intolerant
SubredditDrama,removed,well racism exists in real life talk to someone who identifies as a minority they will have many daily examples for you however if your main concern is a youtube video that goes after a majority group thats been in power for most of recorded historywell you probably arent that concern about the bigger problem
SubredditDrama,removed,fiiine for you only you
SubredditDrama,removed,there is a guy in this thread who did call me a chimp though so yknow are we cool with this
SubredditDrama,removed,as everyone knows any kind of slight against white people a million times worse than anything done to anyone that isnt white
SubredditDrama,removed,that sub legitimizes the term toxic masculinity js
SubredditDrama,removed,you sound like a moron
SubredditDrama,removed,i know how to keep my residents happy and allow them to have enriched lives that are worth living you have no idea what goes on in the mind of someone with dementia

SubredditDrama,removed,this place can fuck off this place is full of people who dont know what the hell they are talking about
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off then you bloody fucking cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,exploiting straight guys for gay porn is hilarious until straight guys are getting their brains busted out on the pavement for their sexual orientation then they should shut the fuck up and not complain
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck that were at war high minded ideals are great in theory but this wont end without the utter destruction of the growing fascist movement sure itd be great if it could be done through peaceful means but the other side isnt playing by those rules so why the fuck should we everytime a cop dies the world gets better every time some trump loving motherfucker gets beaten it does too when fascists die the world improves youre the enemy too you force your own milquetoast inneffectual means on others fuck your piss weak failed attempts at change
SubredditDrama,removed,pretending there are any rules anymore is high minded and idealistic its time to instill terror to attack without limits you are a coward
SubredditDrama,removed,haha this is really meta we are going to have to post a subreddit drama about a post on subreddit drama cause this idiot cant control himself
SubredditDrama,removed,your welcome and i also have a hard time believing you wont respond again because as we have established you have issues with self control
SubredditDrama,removed,go back to pooping in the rthedonald sandbox
SubredditDrama,removed,frankly as a mens rights activist and a guy who doesnt believe feminism still deserves much if any credibility he is the most reddit man in the world
SubredditDrama,removed,i like you ulordtuts
SubredditDrama,removed,darth vader kills jyn erso in rogue one
SubredditDrama,removed,thats retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,thats what rokcupid does and then you get a bunch of depressed selfhating men who bottle up their emotions because they dont want to upset women which makes for an even worse scenario than before they tried to do something about their foreveralone lives
SubredditDrama,removed,they say it because shes black
SubredditDrama,removed,lmao you went through a year of my comments to find a comment in a joke thread how is rhyming islamophobic if you looked a little more recently youd see me defending muslims and bashing trumpsthe altrights racist nonsense
SubredditDrama,removed,the fact that youre not even willing to admit that your posts make an impact is saddening blm needs better people than you im blocking you theres no way that somebody can display this level of ignorance and not be a troll
SubredditDrama,removed,lulz
SubredditDrama,removed,the downvotes will continue until you stop feeling sorry for yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,yall should check this one out its pretty fuckin hot chick fucks a car gear shifter

SubredditDrama,removed,pack it up boys we got ourselves a holocaust revisionist no point prolonging this conversation
SubredditDrama,removed,dude you dont know shit shut up seriously this is a world which youre hypothesizing about from your armchair and youre just looking like a dumbass doing it you actually want to start making meaningful contributions to a discussion on this matter and not expose your ignorance to the entire world then get in on it you might learn a thing or two youre not going to of course which is fine but dont lounge about in a computer saying people are probably doing this and that again to reiterate youre just being dumb criticize a lifestyle all you want thats acceptable and expected in society but for the love of god dont act like you know about it youre just making assumptions and to correct you no big time fucking dealers do not go through a large number of small transactions you want to know why because thats fucking sketchy not bulk shipments which let me just say if you are a big time dealer you are not getting fucking bulk shipments via dark net the darknet is used as a distribution service for your product while you use your own homegrown connects as suppliers the only smart people who deal in bulk products online are the people who are shipping goddamn freighters with drugs ie the people who would never be on the darknet because theyre too busy selling a years drug supply to a war torn central african nation not a goddamn high school student trying out oxy for the first time a large number of small shipments to the same area of the same drugs is super sketchy and its something the feds do actually take notice of it indicates somebody is operating in that particular area with intent to sell a bulk shipment indicates a single drop which can then be transported to different areas throughout the region or even the country yes the feds are going to go after the bulk shipment while it is in transit but once its arrived its not something theyll be looking for anymore unless of course theyve already clocked it but thats a different matter thats what we call a sting youve probably never heard of it a continual supply of small drugs to a select few people through a select few vendors and it would only be a select few vendors you cant buy an eight ball of coke sell that with no problem then turn around and sell an ounce of coke cut with pcp to some unlucky fuck the darknet is not the street the customers have a bit more power to take away your business and they would freak the fuck out if something like that happened thats why you would only buy from a few trusted dealers if you had an iota of a brain on you feds would have you clocked within a month and would give you a kindly knock to question where if youre having any problems with your mail a kindly knock involving a battering ram a flashbang and a gun being pointed in between somebodies eyes so one more time what did we learn here shut your fucking mouth you dont know jack about shit go back to buying pot from your local community college brat and leave the armchair soliloquizing for when youre getting your dick sucked by a toothless meth whore who youre trying to impress with your indepth knowledge of an imaginary drug network run by people as stupid as you
SubredditDrama,removed,well this looks like clear evidence that another sub was brigading i guess the admins will have to shut them down now hahahaha i forgot that bigots have the right to harass other users because of a fundamental misunderstanding of free speech on the internet by admins whose spines have mysteriously gone missing uspez your site is a garbagestrewn stenchhole
SubredditDrama,removed,remember pointing out racism is much worse than actual racism s
SubredditDrama,removed,and its rworldnews so of course the neonazis are upvoted
SubredditDrama,removed,its so fucking gay when people do this us against the man act with mods on reddit stop taking the internet so seriously and get a goddamn life youre not a revolutionary
SubredditDrama,removed,this is what happens when we allow affirmative action we give all the future predicting mural painting jobs to minorities who do not deserve it
SubredditDrama,removed,again for clarity im not saying all women submit to all men and i emphatically dont believe that im saying women are not permitted to teach or have authority over a man religion confirmed as shit
SubredditDrama,removed,im not anti sjw any more than im anti alt right theyre both fucking retarded im just pointing out that yes sjws are clearly more offended thats their entire reason for existing finding something in society that they think is unfair furthermore im pointing out what ugoodgamgreatgame was clearly saying sjws cant whine about using the phrase triggered and then use it thats stupid alllivesmatter see how this is
SubredditDrama,removed,dont let the door hit you in the ass on the way out

SubredditDrama,removed,soros is pumping millions into protests and rioting in an attempt to deligitimize our democracy and liberals are stupid enough to fall for it im all for the war not even kidding these people dont care about america they dont care about their fellow americans all they care about is enslaving everyone else with their ideology not here if our value systems really are that compatible then tool up so we can put you all down and throw you into a mass grave no one gives a shit about and move on with our lives

SubredditDrama,removed,hi heres a summary of what a strawman is a httprationalwikiorgwikistrawman is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater httprationalwikiorgwikiredherring their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance while their argument would still be fallacious they can be at least

SubredditDrama,removed,slippery slope is talking about what will happen usaltybabe is saying they already do support rape an association fallacy is more accurate to what is happening that said after looking around the donald for a while i think it is fair to say they dont have the most respect for women

SubredditDrama,removed,his defense of his friend for raping a woman because his steroid cycle was nauseating as an athlete who has made the mistake of using steroids i can say that it can neither exculpate nor explain nor justify nor mitigate violence of any sort but the way they talk about masculinity specifically makes the defense of sexual violence all the more horrifying wtf is an alpha male and why does it seem give the selfanointed license to be a fucking piece of shit this isnt normal this should never seem normal im done with the internet for tonight
SubredditDrama,removed,these fuckers are disgusting
SubredditDrama,removed,theres two sides to every story and both involve this man raping a woman whatever else varies between the two stories is basically irrelevant because of the glaring fact that the dude is a fucking rapist

SubredditDrama,removed,and you dont like using your brain but thats fine too
SubredditDrama,removed,how uncreative do you have to be where all the derision youre capable of mustering is haha small dick when someone assaults me i respond with what i know will hurt them if someone is deliberately flashing people saying youre a flasher and a creep isnt going to hurt him he already knows that but making fun of something that i can be reasonably certain hes insecure about probably is going to hurt him and possibly discourage him from doing the same thing again its about keeping people honest ethics in gaming journalism man i am having some major flashbacks right now
SubredditDrama,removed,ive thought about dabbling in cuckholdery myself but im not there yet not surprised
SubredditDrama,removed,im having some trouble figuring out where that line is for you apparently if you were going to nuke the whole comment chain between tnbk and myself as unproductive thatd be one thing but if this is ok those darn gooblegoobers do hang around every corner and under every mattress dont they yet this isnt ok then im going to keep getting confused about whats ok and whats not ok

SubredditDrama,removed,forget social darwinism survival of the fittest is a really shitty way to describe actual darwinian evolution selection does not always fix the most fit alleles and can even work against them a more accurate way to describe it is survival of the most locally fit probably unless the population is small or was small recently probably maybe better yet just to ditch the phrase entirely

SubredditDrama,removed,to me this emphasizes even more how irresponsible spezs momentary lapse of control was
SubredditDrama,removed,it gets even deeper uemmatwatters was the one that sent that hate pm to the ss recipient and was vitriolic as fuck in the comments turns out theyre httpimgurcomarahot my guess is that ops cousin accessed his account and kicked all this off consistent with the level of conduct theyve shown so far
SubredditDrama,removed,human empathy is overrated it leads to the normalization of white people

SubredditDrama,removed,there is no drama here redditors clearly know better than mods that is clearly a given look at how the brave totallynotracist subscribers of rnews restored freeze peach
SubredditDrama,removed,lol youre making it about you but what about my feelings i want sex so i should be able to commit rape by deception otherwise he might kill me once he finds out im really a predatory gay male and not a female
SubredditDrama,removed,suppose you hit it off with someone things go well you end up sleeping together later you learn that theyre from mexicothe only way that this detail about their past would bother you is if you have some irrational prejudice against people from mexico same goes for a trans person if you had no idea that they were trans but then the knowledge of that somehow repulses you its because you got some shitty views to sort out well with any luck in the next or years people wont be all hung up on what sex was assigned to someone at birth youre saying that a lesbian being bothered by someone who lied to her and said he was female and only disclosed after raping her is bigotry a shitty view irrational and prejudiced because he identifies as a woman thats homophobic sure you may say the same thing about a man being bothered by a man doing the same thing but what youre saying is still homophobic you are saying that behind homosexualityheterosexuality is transphobia and gaslighting people by saying their taking offense at someone raping them by deception and lying by omission is bigotry a shitty view irrational and prejudiced fuck you and your rapey bigoted rhetoric so many transactivists push this line of logicthis argument its disgusting calling people specifically lesbian women transphobic for being gay and not wanting to sleep with men who identify as women is plain old misogyny but not its coming from people who call themselves progressives as i said this is a widespread argument oh and heres a protip with the exception of intersex people when someone is assigned a sex at birth its because they are that sex someone isnt a detail about their past its a fact of their biology
SubredditDrama,removed,if i find a woman attractive enough that i want to have sex with her then as long as she has a vagina i couldnt give a fuck what she was born with a woman is an adult human female a man identifying as a woman doesnt make him a woman furthermore transwomen do not have vaginas some have neovaginas which are inverted penises sometimes with colon tissue added the bacteria found inside is very different from the bacteria found inside a healthy vagina they lack vaginal rugae and there are other differences i dont feel like listing who cares if youre in a sexual relationship with someone who used to be the same gender as you sex change is a misnomer transwomen are male they are men adult human males no matter how big their implants or how dilated their neovaginas if you are attracted to a male and would have sex with them provided their penis has been inverted you are not straight straight means youre only attracted to the opposite sex youre bisexual and you need to admit it instead of trying to twist logic and perpetuate the misogynistic myth that woman is a feeling or an identity instead of a biological reality
SubredditDrama,removed,you cant feel like a girl girl is not a feeling its a biological reality it is misogynistic to say otherwise furthermore you are clueless about female genitalia a vagina isnt a mutilated dick transwomen with vaginas really have their dicks turned inside out and sometimes colon tissue is attached to make the fistula longer and the result is called a neovagina dont you dare equate womens anatomy with that of a man who has had a fuckhole surgically installed

SubredditDrama,removed,didnt the moral order underlying feudalism undergo radical collapse before not really afaik i mean im not even post grad so dont quote me but the systems of that era were basically just formalized versions of we have multiple people who have money and land and want more who are interacting with each other to do so like it definitely had a whole thing built around it to justify it but the lords squabbling with each other came before the mythology what ended feudalism wasnt peasants waking up it was enough wealth building up w merchants to very slowly build a middle class uwatching

SubredditDrama,removed,so you can look at his profile and see that he said i really shouldnt express any level of moderation on srd i always forget south park neutral and all that whichreally isnt worth being deleted its just kind of a truthful observation saying that social justice can be a ridiculous joke is sacrilege here even if some of us want to remind people of that fact but okay lets say it is worth being deleted with that in mind is cool or is it picking a fight im sure your talents will be valued one day and youll get the attention that you clearly want

SubredditDrama,removed,women drink coffee because of feminism gotcha
SubredditDrama,removed,there hasnt been much in and a half years on reddit that has genuinely disgusted me but this soooonot the virulent bigotry or the fact that this site was comfortable with hosting child pornography or the existence of forums dedicated to watching people die its a video of a guy dressed as pikachu that does it i believe everyone has a right to express an opinion and ill defend your right to an opinion to the death unless youre dancing around in a pikachu costume then youre mentally ill i think you need your mouth sewing shut and your fingers removing but thats a different story i think internet tchuff guys should be the last people making judgement calls re the sanity of others but thats a different story
SubredditDrama,removed,lol this is exactly it in no where do they claim state comment post or otherwise announce that they claim to be logical or even rational rather they simply claim people should come to the sub for the mere lunacy that is the occassional nutjob of a tumblr post those that as an example claim they are kitchen sinkkin or whatever pendulum is finally swinging back to the sanity side give it time it always swings back and stronger read the thread and stop spewing out essays like a moron i quoted the top comments comment chain tia isnt responsible for anything antisjw white supremacy stormfront logic or whatever tia is responsible for outing what is obviously horribly thought out logic this is your mind on tia folks you are so fucking deluded in your bubble of antisjw stupidity that you actually believe that i understand that critiquing tia nad even the maker of the sub coming out to call it a hate sub hurts you bruh but it is also im quite frankly offended youd think insinuate or otherwise believe im in bed with anything that is closely related to people like milo or whatever i never claimed to take any stance in any of this so this is purely namecalling and a horrible attempt at that okay why should i give a fuck let me say it like this if you dont plan on providing actual thought out arguements but instead want to fight on emotions and selfmade logic and beliefs then go ahead but dont expect anyone to come to your side if you dont plan on reading the goddamn posts then dont come here claiming to be logical fuck off with that nonsense oh and try and summarise your shit you tia types lack brevity as much as you claim rationality so again quit the rubbish and grow the fuck up
SubredditDrama,removed,take your reactionary shit back to rdrama

SubredditDrama,removed,i dont need to but i wanted to to make them stand out probably get a little more acquainted with formatting options to stress words in an informal discussion thats kinda why reddit has them did i misinterpret your words willfully so yes i cant imagine anyone accidentally taking a snippet out of a sentence when in the whole context the meaning was quite clear the alternative to doing so willfully well it doesnt speak very highly of you i will paraphrase despite you being an utterwell then lets continue ones comedy act is not necessarily indicative of their personal beliefs or ideologies it is an act much the same as actors in movies where the role they play does not necessarily reflect on their real life ideals motives or behaviors you do know the difference between fiction and factual works i hope that is the premise in a nutshell furthermore a lot of people look at comedy as a noholdsbarred situation where things that wouldcould be offensive if screamed in someones face on the street could be made light of on a stage when telling a story i should hope you actually knew that but i felt like expressing it anyhow if you dont i really do pitty your judgemental existance

SubredditDrama,removed,hey everyone this guys likes to jerk it to virtual year olds
SubredditDrama,removed,they are cartoons of children and do you also cry out in moral outrage every time someone in a video game is shot they are pedophiles using flimsy excuses to defend living out their sick fantasies how do you know they are actually attracted to real children do you have esp and why does it matter if they arent harming anyone if your morals are based on anything other than the effect of their actions have on other peopleanimals then your morals are simply bullshit the only valid morals are those that categorize actions based on how much it harms or helps other people things like this that simply have no effect on anyone are simply irrelevant to a discussion about morality anybody has a higher moral standing than pedophiles except little children who get upset over what peoples porn preferences are and use their selfserving bullshit morals to attack other people whom are harming nobody not even themselves i would argue that you are far far more morally bankrupt then these people but one thing it has is that it doesnt hire underage actors and with very good reason and neither does this game and just to clarify you are in agreeance with the idea that the abuse of fictional children is worse than the victimization of real women in porn

SubredditDrama,removed,ubendreams creator of rnuclearthrone posted content to the subreddit discord channel that led to him being banned from the channel he then goes on a drunken rampage on his own subreddit removing all the mods and removing comments and posts from users who speak out against him the subreddit has since migrated to rnuclearthrone where most of the original mods reside
SubredditDrama,removed,ubigmeaniehead youre an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,there is nothing to resolve you have some really heave god complex and really dont seem fit to be in charge of a community you cant handle bad press in any way anyone not on your side gets banned and has their comments removed i can guarantee you wont be welcome back once its sorted case in point its a subreddit for people to discuss a video game not your own personal dictatorship start treating it that way
SubredditDrama,removed,youd think that the bar owners had shot and murdered someone based on the reaction from reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,im really shocked by how many people are pissed off by this idea if it helps out one person thats enough god people on this website are so creepy sometimes
SubredditDrama,removed,the idea is that nobody actually opposes exploiting women they just say so to get feminist brownie points
SubredditDrama,removed,op posts in kia uncensorednews thedonald etc sounds like his post is ｖｉｒｔｕｅ ｓｉｇｎａｌｉｎｇ
SubredditDrama,removed,who the fuck do i root for this dumb attitude is what is wrong with this sub enjoy the fucking drama or get out
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit is full of antimuslim and antiwoman shit its twisted to fit the narrative its why i generally stay out of default subs
SubredditDrama,removed,ah so its some sort of red pill garbage lingo got it
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,believing the holohoax and jews are a horrible people who believe in a religion that says they are superior to other people
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont hate homosexuals coffee isnt harmless its the worst most widely used drug in the western world
SubredditDrama,removed,kap should have worn his burkina because a little bitch raised by white parents
SubredditDrama,removed,this is reddit so the average age is
SubredditDrama,removed,bbut toiracseniichan i am not a weeaboo
SubredditDrama,removed,sometimes i feel like redditors are the kids who got annoyed at sitting in english class overanalyzing every bit of potential symbolism and reacted by refusing to see any deeper meaning in anything
SubredditDrama,removed,of course you didnt literally say it but its in there surrounded by minority millionaires guess racism is over guys pack it up jesus fuck that is so fucking stupid minority millionaires should be the ones to say shit and so what if its a simple easy protest its a way to express his beliefs if he stands up hes showing his implicit support of the system that he has an issue with its only stupid because you disagree with it on top of that its in addition to the other work he does which other people have been posting all over this thread this little thing is perfectly consistent with his viewpoints and actions thats adorable you keep raging against that machine via your high speed internet connection blow it out your ass you condescending prick
SubredditDrama,removed,the far rights labyrinthine relationship with the concept of reality is one of its most fascinating aspects in a car crash sort of way theyre being ironic except when theyre not they reject postmodernism but their entire rejection of the mainstream media is based on caricatures of postmodern criticism they get angry at conspiracies and censorship and yet are proud to remain in echo chambers to astroturf movements if its for the sake of pushing a narrative they consider themselves redpilled able to see the harsh reality that all these coddled liberals refuse to acknowledge and in the same breath demand to be treated the same way that in their imagination pc culture treat these minorities women etc that they consider weak and contemptible but the best part about all of this is that some of them get legitimately angry each time theyre reminded that their views arent mainstream when half the reason they do this is to be cool edgy rebels by uthrowalongwaytogo
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit for making fun of a dumbfuck statement just downvote srd because retarded political statements are okay if theyre from your side
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off bud ive been out of college a long time and i went to a private engineering school so it wasnt even the fanciful strawman safe space that youre imagining and youre an absolute shut in tool if you think racism still doesnt pervade society i cant go a day without some moron making some disparaging racist remark
SubredditDrama,removed,alright then i guess im a racist you got me oh know whatever will i do i guess ill feel bad or something oh no someone made an off color joke about someone else watch out the racism police are gonna get you because someone was offended i guess just being a good person isnt enough i have to go out and shout and put other people down for their obvious racism even if they dont know they are doing it fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,ive never met a sane person that watches rachel maddow i dont know what it is about him but he attracts all the crazies
SubredditDrama,removed,a subreddit full of insecure neckbeards
SubredditDrama,removed,those comments i dont get those comments what happened to twox it was a place for women to discuss womens perspectives now it seems like its a bunch of angry men bashing women and discussing how much they hate women why are men so obsessed with posting to a place for womens perspectives why dont they just sit down shut up and listen and god forbid they could actually learn something the horror
SubredditDrama,removed,this fucking sub is ridiculous emotional abuse seriously what is wrong with you op damaged her bfs property and should have offered to replace it end of story if op took the position thats apparently popular here its a bodily function this stuff happens get over it rather than apologize and try to fix the situation then yes her bf should be irritated with her if someone damages your property accident or not and then basically tells you shit happens then fuck that person in every other situation when someone got their bodily fluids all over someone else stuff telling them to just get over it would be completely fucking nuts why on earth should that be acceptable here virgin neckbeard uoscarasimov comes to the rescue of mras everywhere hey boys its okay to shame women for their bodily functions women cant be groooosssssss women arent allowed to poop ect ect i learned about this in my embodiments of the patriarchy class men force an unattainable standard that women shouldnt have bodily functions and if they fail to reach this unattainable standard they are labeled gross ect ect this is one of the many ways patriarchy keeps women down and prevents them from achieving true equality and validation ect ect ect
SubredditDrama,removed,hmmm i wonder why fags would be islamophobes i mean surely it cannot be due to the fact that muslims literally kill them just for being gay right
SubredditDrama,removed,dude this is a trp thread as sjwy as srd is and it fucking is all other soapboxes pale in comparison to the zealotry and fanaticism that the feminist soapbox inspires in the users here youd get downvoted for saying that literally anything negative about trp was wrong if someone was like i think trp is bringing about the end of western civilization and you just said rpanichistory youd get downvoted if someone said that trp killed kennedy and you were like ehh i dont think it existed then youd get a raging post about misogyny in and downvoted if you posted at least they dont deny the moon landing youd get downvoted to and someone would talk about how conspiracy theorists are more likely to be men than women theres literally nothing you can say that isnt negative about trp that you could say in this instance just enjoy it lol and relish the angry downvotes
SubredditDrama,removed,id love to know what the original post was that earned the ban but i bet it contained all of the following words cuck sjw autist triggered and im sure whatever it was contributed massively to the discussion
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit children went off on a woman who was probably being used as a scapegoat for the company for banning fph and other harassing subs because of muh freeze peach or some shit like that
SubredditDrama,removed,that makes more sense
SubredditDrama,removed,trp is terrible and if you manage to convince yourself that it is not in any way then you are part of the problem
SubredditDrama,removed,sounds like youre a cuck
SubredditDrama,removed,because someone they agreed with politically attacked someone they disagreed with politically and they wanted to show that they really didnt give a fuck which is fine if thats your thing i guess as long as youre consistent maybe but somehow i think uthreepumptrump would be singing a different tune with regards to the rule of law and how it perceives the initiation of violence if the shoe were on the other foot just a hunch
SubredditDrama,removed,just to throw umisterbigstuff and in since they gave similar replies i guess i dont follow comics enough to know about bucky and barry allen as it is the major problem for comics for me is that they dont keep a bible or something and just retcon on retcon on retcon the most recent one that pisses me off greatly is matt fractions run on hawkeye he makes hawkeyeclint barton go back to being deaf partially to give a deaf boy the motivation to wear his hearing aids in one of the later issues of his run the very next writer especially after a very amazing issue showing the issues hawkeye had with it that came after matt fraction just totally wrote it off as a i got better trope royally pissed me off with marvel i mean i dont know if there is another deaf superhero or someone struggling with it i know northstar in xmen married his boyfriend so its not like marvel cant get representation in or introduce new characters or have characters that had it like hawkeye as a plotpoint in the past gain them back and keep them they just dont do it its partially why i dont do anything other than read xmen collections from the library and dont really buy tradeissues at all theres no consistency for characters or plotpoints and they just change them at will yeah it may help with sales boosts but i honestly think introducing new characters or plots and retiring or benching certain members would help with that also while im thinking of it icemanbobby drake suddenly being gay after being thrown forward in time and being revealed by jean grey royally pissed me off with how badly managed marvel did that as well but thats for another topic
SubredditDrama,removed,okay im kinda confused on your responses now not what youre saying but where youre coming from so if youll excuse me ill go line by line fair but im not transgender well i didnt think you were most people arent but my point is how most people remember chelsea manning as bradley manning the point is most people remember manning for what she did which she did while she was a he so you should be able to understand why people slip into referring to bradley manning because the chelsea manning name has done nothing of interest the only reason youd think of chelsea manning instead is if youre either new to following news or youre trans yourself most people arent either so most people will often think of her as bradley thats okay the victims here are transgendered people who are subject to disrespect from the world on a daily basis akin to bullying first you can decide how you feel about things before identifying a victim you dont need to find the weaker party and agree with them thats actually a crazily simplistic way to look at things but if you were going to the victims here is the american intelligence apparatus which works for the us people not a fucking traitor i dont see what the problem is in trying to stick up for them instead of being a bystander and not giving a shit i cant help you with that you should really stop just trying to stand up for the little guy and start with figuring out whats most important to you regardless of their power dynamics you seriously just seem to be saying you support anyone whos weaker than someone else
SubredditDrama,removed,why are you fixated on judging people so hard anyone that doesnt agree with you in any sense is shitty which is extra weird because this quote wasnt even as bad as what you normally call people
SubredditDrama,removed,lol dude stop being a cuck and take the l from uusedontheskin
SubredditDrama,removed,theres people that might deserve our sympathy but its not someone who volunteered for war then got outraged that people die and decided to share secrets about it risking the people who joined that war while trusting herhim again using slash because its a her now but was a him then but what if theyre trans game changer s
SubredditDrama,removed,they say theres infinite realities in the universe think hard can you even imagine one in which i give a fuck report away
SubredditDrama,removed,is saying i dont care evidence of my anger thats interesting
SubredditDrama,removed,im highly surprised nobody responded by agreeing with him that it is possible that white people are genetically predisposed to be trigger happy and prone to violence
SubredditDrama,removed,if you dont share this with others you are against equality
SubredditDrama,removed,eat a dick no one cares about your stupid rulebook
SubredditDrama,removed,a stripper party is a great idea and what he said about chicks is pretty much true
SubredditDrama,removed,beta faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,how anyone could link the man coming out against the oppression faced by minorities in this country to hating or bring ungrateful of his white parents is beyond me fuck off with this sjw pc bullshit
SubredditDrama,removed,why would anyone want to touch up a fuckin tranny
SubredditDrama,removed,please stop using the word tranny its an offensive slur thats been used to denigrate and marginalize trans people for many years my god the amount of pc bullshit is unbelievable a tranny is just a nickname normal people use for trans its no big deal
SubredditDrama,removed,the president of america is fucking black people just look for shit to cry about if nignogs were not selling drugs and robbing places they would not get shot by cops racial profiling makes sense and saves time
SubredditDrama,removed,its just a bit of a joke nickname its not offensive like calling them apes lighten up
SubredditDrama,removed,this is retarded sjw bullshit ruining peoples lives all over again any one who supports this stuff is a piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,what is it with redditors and being petrified of appearing anything less than masculine
SubredditDrama,removed,its perfectly fine to guilt people for doing immoral things grow the fuck up
SubredditDrama,removed,we clearly have different ideas of what immoral means id place a bet that my definition is far more commonly used than yours is oh lets hear this this should be fun
SubredditDrama,removed,found alt account
SubredditDrama,removed,sarcasm stereotyping black men as hypermasculine sexobsessed savages is one of the oldest racist stereotypes there are besides playing into the general background racist oppression it also directly contributed to countless lynchings of black men who looked wrong at some white ho to kill a mockingbird was not set in a fantasy world you know so including black people in that sort of generalizations is problematic and lowkey racist while explicitly talking about white men only is not racist so why not show some sensitivity and do that by the way when im sarcastic in rsubredditdrama i always include s in my comment to avoid confusing the locals
SubredditDrama,removed,reasonable points and then you talk like a fag and your shits all retarded reddit dot com
SubredditDrama,removed,two and a half
SubredditDrama,removed,

SubredditDrama,removed,shut the fuck up
SubredditDrama,removed,yes you are
SubredditDrama,removed,the lol really shows youre sincere with the apology
SubredditDrama,removed,amazingly enough its possible to be a quality dick without acting like a transphobic asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,as its currently used on reddit it just means youre acting like a nomal considerate human being and the person saying it doesnt see why anyone would act like that unless they were trying to impress people well it also means look at me everyone i hate those virtue signalling sjws too please like me
SubredditDrama,removed,and what mistake are you referring to i hate hillary the fact that you indirectly enabled the alt reich repent ye of independent political thought
SubredditDrama,removed,its binary youre literally a neonazi supporting cheeto benito or you love the slay queen chillary clinton our lord and savior who might mix it up with the russians over a nofly zone in syria but dude have you seen how outrageous this latest thing trump said is
SubredditDrama,removed,hes the closest america will ever get to a fascist sadly i doubt that i think trump is bad enough but more accurately viewed as a portent of things to come if neoliberal governance continues for much longer he was just so unbelievably narcissistic and clownish to accidentally stumble upon what turns out to be a very viable path to success in republican politics
SubredditDrama,removed,every rule was a brand new rule at one point except the second amendment which is a natural right and exists since the planck epoch after the big bang
SubredditDrama,removed,you dont need to love her but you do need to realize that shes the best option weve got
SubredditDrama,removed,oh good the militant arm of the bourgeoisie have pit bulls now
SubredditDrama,removed,i love it when vegheads dont agenda post
SubredditDrama,removed,no fam the attire of characters in media is the greatest issue of our time
SubredditDrama,removed,how old are you and most people at the time agreed he outshone kerry and was a great highlight its also hes been relevant for at least years also longevity doesnt hate doing things people dislike hate even joe biden whos been a senator since he was and has been trying to be president since has pretty good favourability but i guess its out of the ordinary and a republican conspiracy that people dislike someone who ran a dogwhistle campaign against obama called young black men super predators in an effort to push a horrible crime bill pro drug war corporate tied war monger who praises war criminals like henry kissinger trump or even republicans being horrible doesnt mean hillary should be canonized
SubredditDrama,removed,just horrible isnt it this is exactly why the attire that doodle people are made to wear is the greatest issue of our time
SubredditDrama,removed,why on earth would you let this slide the clothing that is drawn on to imaginary scribble people is perhaps the greatest issue of our time your apathy over this is frankly appalling
SubredditDrama,removed,wow thats an incredibly half assed outlook to take the clothing that comic artists put on women in random panels let alone the cover of comic books is perhaps the single most important factor in determining beauty standards for first world women if we dont shout this down at every opportunity and rehash why this is so sick toxic and morally perverse we are failing women all over the world it is simply put the greatest issue of our time
SubredditDrama,removed,honestly you are a retard either you are too young to remember or too stupid to realize this but pit bulls only recently have been viewed as dangerous it wasnt until around the when news networks started running sensationalist headlines that dangerous breeds of dogs came into focus before pit bulls it was rottweilers st bernards doberman pinschers german shepardsall these dogs were lambasted by the media at one time or another as being vicious and dangerous somehow the american pit bull terrier went from being the all american family dog to vicious unstable murderer the people who are attracted to pit bulls because they want an aggressive scary looking dog do so because of the perception that the breed of dog has these characteristics you would have to be a complete fucking retard to start legislating policy on the moronic perceptions of other retards you want to know which are the most aggressive breeds dachshunds chihuahuas jack russell terriers australian cattle dogs american cocker spaniels beagles so a douchebag has a pit bull they are not aggressive by nature so they mistreat the dog abuse the animal to make it aggressive and your solution is what forcing people to spay and neuter their dogs i think thats a good idea but not as a solution to the problem wouldnt it be better just to enforce strict penalties for animal abuse
SubredditDrama,removed,amazing to think we have people so ensconsed in privilege in almost to be able to write this off as a nonissue must be nice being this insulated from real problems to be concerned with what the bombing of aleppo expanding wealth inequality what a joke
SubredditDrama,removed,you absolutely will these kinds of drawings are a form of gender terrorism to keep women subservient and constantly striving for impossible beauty standards keeping them from becoming woke to the patriarchy after all comic book drawings are basically the single biggest setter of female beauty standards aside from video games and movie posters when were all hooked up to milking machines you will be regretful
SubredditDrama,removed,lol if there were no personal attacks in srd this sub would be completely dead as half the comments are making fun of the people you link to in your posts all you are trying to do is justify removal of my comment because it makes too much sense rationality has no place in a sub full of imbeciles
SubredditDrama,removed,lol nice one redditbro dae le triggurd truly the height of humor here
SubredditDrama,removed,the reason being his active participation in the gender terrorism women face every day dont be coy you know exactly why this is being done
SubredditDrama,removed,im sure everyone loves your condescending concern redditbro remember we can merrily dismiss any antipatriarchical beliefs as simple hysteria
SubredditDrama,removed,your dismissive attitude towards this issue which is so incredibly important people will no must bring it up over even a single offending comic panel is frankly appalling dont you understand how important this is for women everywhere
SubredditDrama,removed,awww this white male teen is angry
SubredditDrama,removed,did your mom drop you on your head as a baby numerous times
SubredditDrama,removed,did your mom drop you on your head as a baby numerous times
SubredditDrama,removed,did your mom drop you on your head as a baby numerous times
SubredditDrama,removed,did your mom drop you on your head as a baby numerous times
SubredditDrama,removed,did your mom drop you on your head as a baby numerous times
SubredditDrama,removed,nah just doing to him what hes doing to everyone else in this thread i had some time to kill so why not
SubredditDrama,removed,uadevland putting r will auto hyperlink to a subreddit thats named whatevers after the r
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah you dont think black americans are stupid for being black but for being american a very progressive hate
SubredditDrama,removed,talking about this incident is petty it is pathetic it is part of the toxicity that is ruining our nations discourse honestly anyone who fails to understand this must be without naming names an absolute fucking moron
SubredditDrama,removed,at last war has made me into a man weeeeee i am philip j frybot from hovering squid world
SubredditDrama,removed,im a coward also this isnt a conviction im sufficiently confident in to take action this is just a thought ive had since the shooting in dallas see i like to think of myself as a good person but im sensitive to the fact that i benefit from oppressing people of color and this fact gives me anxiety so i try to support at least privately endeavors by people of color to end their oppression but i am often horrified by the more extreme actions people of color sometimes take against their oppressors consider the nat turner rebellion for example but i have to admit that if i were a slave that i might think nat turner was a hero so that perhaps my horror arises from the fact that i identify with the slave owners that turner killed which would be needless to say problematic so i have to at least consider the possibility that any horror i feel at violent acts by people of color to end their oppression is however much i might rationalize it due to my my identification with their oppressors i hate this about myself so i try to think really hard about cases like these where there is a potential violent act an oppressed person could take against their oppressors thus when i consider the recent killings in dallas i dont particularly like what happened but when i think really hard about it i just dont see what else micah johnson was supposed to do
SubredditDrama,removed,i hear that the main villain is the stay puft marshmallow man only he has a neckbeard and a fedora and is rambling about gamergate
SubredditDrama,removed,ive seen threads from rdrama where somebody is going to go to another country to be violent or they talked about why they arent going out and killing their excuses are really flimsy and sometimes very funny one said they would but they are afraid of spiders they want to cheer on the violence from the sidelines but dont want to get their hands dirty
SubredditDrama,removed,i wasnt even interested in the film before but this is like christmas coming early something reddit really really hated is getting okay reviews and its generating stuff like this engaging in massive brigading to hide all such comments from view basically behaving like a twobit nomenklatura in the rocky iv version of a totalitarian state its beautiful oh and theres a thread in kia on based on a satirical article he wrote in response to why women arent funny apparently unlike internalized misogyny internalized misandry actually exists whod have thunk with interesting discussion on how calling people fags is male bonding or whether his distaste for said male bonding makes him homosexual
SubredditDrama,removed,they cant cede any land in the war against sjws even when youre completely wrong you have to fight to the last man
SubredditDrama,removed,ive never understood this grow up mentality something from my childhood has been ruined and im outraged i literally just watched all copies of ghostbusters being burned in the street damn you feminists
SubredditDrama,removed,they still fap to her last time i check
SubredditDrama,removed,having women makes it objectively worse than any male equivalent duh why would he need to watch it to know the truth
SubredditDrama,removed,i think this ghostbusters movie is yet another example of feminists trying to ruin media look at the great shakesphere yeah weve all heard of him but there was a time he was the most popular playright of the day and people far and wide used to go to his plays he also used to hire only men to play all his characters next thing you know some women were affirmative actioned into the play world and what do you know you never hear a thing from shakespire anymore its an absolute disgrace what these feminists are doing for entertsainment
SubredditDrama,removed,well given he said you mock reddit i doubt youll ever run out of content for the sub this place gets rough
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean its not like people on reddit have ever pretended to be personally experienced in something in order to push their agenda source world renowned expert in human behaviour or something like that
SubredditDrama,removed,i thought it was kinda topical considering the director has specifically
SubredditDrama,removed,taking revenge through gossiping thats pretty stereotypically gay
SubredditDrama,removed,of course its him that guy is still my favorite lolcow in this website well he and cambiecammie or whatever nickname that crazy incel guy has
SubredditDrama,removed,so you just straight up refuse to acknowledge think of who youre replying to

SubredditDrama,removed,i got banned for saying the word cunt told rcricket because it was funny got banned for brigading because uazza went into the sub and said how shit the mod team was uvicbiaswatch then got banned for posting in our own thread saying rsports suck even though he never went into the sub was a great day
SubredditDrama,removed,people arent down voting you because they think they are some how standing up to the man they are down voting you because what you said wasnt original and contained an antiquated slur that most of the rear of us have done away with so we dont sound
SubredditDrama,removed,mark my words they will turn it into a censorship free news source on reddit to compete with scary competitors like rpolitics and rhentainewssource
SubredditDrama,removed,can you blame xem xe basically raped xer
SubredditDrama,removed,i loathe rvideos so much
SubredditDrama,removed,if youre so scared of being called a name on an anonymous website that you cant share your opinion maybe you should turn off the computer this shit again are we so entitled now that we truly believe we should be able to say whatever we want whenever we want and its never our problem if someone else has a bad reaction to it whatever happened to tact and human decency if someone says youre making an environment toxic maybe you should turn off the computer toughen up and come back when you can handle the sometimes insulting nature of disagreement the reasonable people back their claims up by talking about how modern feminism is often very regressive in attitude towards both men and women except it isnt
SubredditDrama,removed,woman irrationally accuses someone of wanting to rape based on gender you go girl everyone better kiss her ass right now man irrationally accuses someone of wanting to rape based on sexuality stone him to death fucking piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit youre stupid hahahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,you misunderstand i totally get caring that someone else is having a rough time what i mean was why the fuck do you care you obviously dont understand the concept of basic empathy so im not sure what is drawing you to give a shit
SubredditDrama,removed,read the comment it was in response to jackass i really fucking hate you people who either dont bother to read or have the reading comprehension of a hypothetical fucking seven year old but just cant wait to chime in
SubredditDrama,removed,dae two sides of the coin
SubredditDrama,removed,sounds like a snowflake needs to go to the special school where their antics can be properly appreciated by the other kids who cant hack real life
SubredditDrama,removed,lol only babies pull that this conversation is over crap
SubredditDrama,removed,in their defense at least of trump voters are human so youre saying the who werent white that voted for him dont count as human
SubredditDrama,removed,wat
SubredditDrama,removed,its in the republicans best interest to dismantle education they know people lacking in critical thinking skills are their most loyal voters remember when the texas board of education literally had discouraging independent thought in their mission statement
SubredditDrama,removed,the way it affects labor costs and job allocation is pretty damn identical but you dont know that do you id cite bagwhatis work on immigration and outsourcing herehe demonstrates that they effect things quite differently using actual numbers rather than arrogantlystated outdated axiomsbut im frankly uninterested in pursuing a conversation with such an asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,im sorry but until uthereasontrumpwon declares something as the reason trump won it is pure speculation and should be ignored until confirmation can be obtained mr won care to comment
SubredditDrama,removed,his sealioning game is pretty strong throughout that thread but then his altright instincts finally start to betray him farther down im sorry i missed the part where you own this sub reddit or website can i use a similar argument and say liberals should leave america if they dont like it if you criticize america you should leave it maybe we should toss kaepernick back into africa mmmmm that dietracism goes down so smooth
SubredditDrama,removed,httpimgurcommgfmhdc httpimgurcomjyzuqcb httpimgurcombiklpuc httpimgurcomvmxevop i guarantee you if more people fought racists whenever they saw them there wouldnt be a racist rapist in the white house right now i dont have a millimeter of care for a pitiful fascist who would gladly do the same to me if he had the chance fascists want to take everything from you they are not your friends they are scum dont let them fester remember to bash the fash
SubredditDrama,removed,the fash should always be bashed give them an inch and theyll take the lives of million innocents
SubredditDrama,removed,the alt right is as toxic as sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,man who would have guessed that the limp dicked nerd behind that shitty workplace cartoon strip would end up doing so much damage to the world
SubredditDrama,removed,fascist mods dont want to be bashed probably i actually dont know what the comment was about
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,its a trollpost gd reddit autistic fucks will believe anything
SubredditDrama,removed,exactly the thing is if people organised a rally in support of isis downtown in a city and people went there to beat them the isis supporters noone would be saying what about their freedom of speech because everyone would immediately recognize their odiousness and threat level and rightly so but white people are always treated like their these innocent little lambs even when theyre organizing groups to attack minorities for example the national front in england in the may have technically been a legitimate political party but they had hordes of skinheads affiliated with them who went around attacking anyone nonwhite in support of the party a lot of people arguing this line what about the nazis rights are very naive and dont realize these are not just people with fucked up opinions members of these far right groups commit violence against civilians all the time and if you are a member of a far right group that has some of their members engage in violence against civilians you become a legitimate target for violence because you are affiliated with and implicitly provide direct support for those who do commit the violence in your group if someone knowingly supported a member of the taliban or al qaeda or isis and hide them from the authorities and that supporter got beaten up as a result he would deserve no sympathy but even though its just as bad when people are involved in the far right groups we still hear what about the poor nazis over and over its not a matter of attacking people for their beliefs its a matter of using any means including physical force if necessary to break up groups that aim to radicalize create and support the next dylan storm roof these far right groups are low key terrorists and need to be treated as such
SubredditDrama,removed,wall street cant print money lmao
SubredditDrama,removed,printing money implies its free money its not banks serve a purpose
SubredditDrama,removed,this feels a little personal for this sub huh why dont we let drama be the ones to mock peoples loneliness
SubredditDrama,removed,wow two second rate european countries cant get it right who next cyprus
SubredditDrama,removed,there was once a general consensus among pollsters who said hillary would win hillary did win by votes but since we literally give stupid people more votes than the smart people get we voted for someone who has lied literally about every little thing has zero diplomatic capability uses twitter like a youtube reject and straightup has less political experience than any president ive had in my lifetime bush had more experience going into the presidency than trump and he still managed to fuck it all up looking at exactly how seriously trump isnt taking this rolefrom the beginningthis guy is going to be looking real stupid real soon the op and trump
SubredditDrama,removed,more hibernian lies
SubredditDrama,removed,im seeing starvation and disease but im not seeing the industrial killing gassing and incineration or the purpose i can see the reasoning behind the camps they viewed these people as enemies of the state so presumably wanted them in there not to detract from the war effort but i dont see why they would gas them particularly because theyd come up with the haavara agreement and madagascar plan they would have a use to germany as unpaid underfed labour and could have been taxed when they left the country but mass extermination would seem to be a solution that had already been solved with the creation of the camps it also seems like the idea would help with the formation of israel which was no doubt a good thing mind and getting more in the way of reparations
SubredditDrama,removed,then lets kill ourselves
SubredditDrama,removed,i love that trumps base is already crumbling without him even taking office yet
SubredditDrama,removed,lets find out i think cat haters are subhuman scum that should be actively sought out and locked in a room with of starving cats also the walls are lined with screens playing cat videos constantly murdercathaters
SubredditDrama,removed,oh dear god what a bunch of losers these drama postsers are
SubredditDrama,removed,looks like the work of ctr shills to me
SubredditDrama,removed,drama has been having daily threads whenever a clinton supporter defends their vote as well its bubbling into worst of
SubredditDrama,removed,its ok once they feast on the flesh of the nonbelievers they wont be starving
SubredditDrama,removed,shamelessly stealing titles from the superior sub for shame
SubredditDrama,removed,thank you for correcting the record you cuck shill
SubredditDrama,removed,oh i forgot i was on rsubredditdrama where you morons literally cant take a joke btw i was joking
SubredditDrama,removed,wait are you telling me that you cant send a person to jail by screaming lock her up and also that trump is hesitant to fulfill one of his poorly thought out policies well i never
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry if it went over your head mate
SubredditDrama,removed,holy fuck youre nuts
SubredditDrama,removed,i have this one account you have clearly a disorder preventing normal behavior
SubredditDrama,removed,please provide mountains of evidence or even a small hill of evidence that hitler and the nazis killed million jews the million persecuted jews myth had been around for decades before anyone has ever heard of hitler just because it gets repeated ad nausea doesnt mean its real news
SubredditDrama,removed,you need help
SubredditDrama,removed,taking the bait
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean if you cant see that i was joking i truly feel for you then again you are just proving my point that nobody on this sub can stop being smug for long enough to take a joke
SubredditDrama,removed,i never said it was funny just that it was a joke also i dont give a damn about le reddit karma points
SubredditDrama,removed,oh i forgot i was on rsubredditdrama where you morons literally cant take a joke
SubredditDrama,removed,less but they are gayer and danker
SubredditDrama,removed,your life is a joke but nobody is laughing
SubredditDrama,removed,let me tell you this rdrama is one of the most malevolent cruel coldhearted online communities youll ever find and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that reddit would allow such a vile festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist you think town was bad that subreddit if you pick up on the dogwhistles and many dont even bother with that say want you want about stormfront at least it bans n will reveal itself to you as reddits number one hub for the webs most hardened nazis klansmen fascists and gamergaters youll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible thats intentional they encourage arguments in the comments section thats intentional you know the three minute hate its from this underrated book give it a read its scary how much it parallels our society its like that they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit normalizing these evil feelings they brigade from subreddit to subreddit having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering reddits homegrown white supremacy movement theyve kinkshamed hundreds of people too some even to death i fear that rdrama may be producing an entire army of dylann roofs and elliot rogers and i highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura
SubredditDrama,removed,thats my secret im always mad
SubredditDrama,removed,the whole stalking and harassment thing they do is where they get that reputation ask misanthropdick how hes spent the last das submitting and then deleting threads about posters who challenge him
SubredditDrama,removed,remember when this subreddit was used for laughing at dumb drama and not for the trolls from drama to air personal grievances
SubredditDrama,removed,why is the main character of this meme a fucking white male this is so racist i cant even
SubredditDrama,removed,thats unfair the good people of kotakuinaction are very concerned with racism that is false racism accusations and the worst racism of all racism against white people
SubredditDrama,removed,as an atheist its definitely in bad taste but its hard to take people being pod about it seriously when muhammad actually did fuck a year old and the catholic church actively spent decades covering for pedophiles
SubredditDrama,removed,is it racist though doesnt seem to be any different from all the people coming into rsweden all the time and saying börk börk but i doubt a lot of people would say thats racist
SubredditDrama,removed,the material conditions that result in the withering of the state only happen under a dictatorship of the proletariat where the working class are in control and democratically control the means of production and thus are not alienated
SubredditDrama,removed,this is pretty hilarious in retrospect

SubredditDrama,removed,the funniest thing about this whole comment section is if you replace redpiller with muslim youd get the same result saying there are no moderate redpillers if you are not for the quran and its ideologies you are not a real muslim lol at him saying people who hate women dont get the original philosophy goto defense for mysoginistic and homosexual ideologies of islam its interesting how people far left people mostly hate on something and defend another when its two sides of the same coin at least redpillers arent massacring gays in night clubs
SubredditDrama,removed,for bonus enjoyment check out the reapernames twitter
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a retard

SubredditDrama,removed,theres a jew involved so im not exactly sure why you need help figuring out who the mastermind is here
SubredditDrama,removed,at least when i was insulting you i was backing it with logical arguments you fail
SubredditDrama,removed,oh of course if i dont like being murdered im racist you can fuck off and ban me if you want islam is a murder cult thats always been the point it always will be until it fades out of the modern world
SubredditDrama,removed,hey usenethsomed still upsetangry then why dont you come to this sub we are much more kinder understanding and progressive than those rdrama drones

SubredditDrama,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,removed,deport who anyone who looks brown people who didnt do anything wrong you know theres no muslim identity card right idiot youre literally making an argument for ethnic cleansing

SubredditDrama,removed,censorship daddy k champ
SubredditDrama,removed,caring more about your agenda than deaths go fuck yourself you crazy leftist
SubredditDrama,removed,from the megathread what are news sites what is twitter
SubredditDrama,removed,islam is not a race though
SubredditDrama,removed,its sad that i was hoping the shooter was white because then we could just focus on how tragic it is to hate a certain group so much now we get to talk about why we need to hate followers of a certain religion why is white the exception would you have breathed a sigh of relief too if the shooter had been any other poc except muslim
SubredditDrama,removed,hahaha
SubredditDrama,removed,in the context of the sub faggot is used with a positive connotation
SubredditDrama,removed,i just fucking told you its from a deleted account this was the thread httpimgurcomsralbtg this was my now deleted comment that said word for word wait so trump supporters are against lgbt now so why shouldnt i vote bernie get fucked you tool if you dont think rthedonald users have a vendetta against lgbt people you are blind
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,oh dont worry i took the liberty of asking for a ban hours ago from one of your fellow islam fellating friends
SubredditDrama,removed,deleted thread my ass
SubredditDrama,removed,rsrd mods hate gays just as much as rnews mods wow i did not expect that
SubredditDrama,removed,and zero articles calling for the deportation of white boys or increased attacks and hostility against them
SubredditDrama,removed,poking around rbettereddit right now to see if therere any logged alternatives to rnews but i havent heard anything from uappropriateusername
SubredditDrama,removed,i liked how you deleted the comment you made telling someone to kill themselves at least you have a general idea on how fucking retarded you are httpimgurcomxdlwqnd
SubredditDrama,removed,the meta discussio should overwhelm the discussion of the attack this is a meta sub
SubredditDrama,removed,its just a temporary moratorium if the meta drama is still around when its lifted im sure there will be plenty to use
SubredditDrama,removed,how dare you no one treats lgbt people better than islamic countries
SubredditDrama,removed,islam wasnt always like this actually i think being gay has always been a death sentence under islamic law
SubredditDrama,removed,more censorship great
SubredditDrama,removed,that is the discussion hundreds upon hundreds have been killed by vicious attacks sponsored by isis and hiding our heads in the sand wont solve the problem it is time that we start doing something to increase border security
SubredditDrama,removed,if you want to contact admin regarding to removing the mods at rnews link is here httpswwwredditcomcontact hint do it
SubredditDrama,removed,the thing is that rnews now made news of themselves look at the post of rall idiotic cowards take away from the victims shame
SubredditDrama,removed,he is he deleted a comment that he made telling another user to kill themselves rsuspiciousspecialist is a terrorist sympathizer a homophobe and a terrible person all around
SubredditDrama,removed,so you have no argument just more bullshit virtue signalling let me be straightforward with you people are going to continue to die patriotic honest muslimamericans are going to be increasingly marginalized because people like you fail to make the distinctions between them and religious fundamentalists abroad how many people have to die before it becomes blatantly obvious to you we need to control our borders for the safety of all americans of all backgrounds end of story
SubredditDrama,removed,kill yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know what happens in the trump subreddits i filter them out all i know is what happened in rnews and it was handled absolutely idiotic i have been on reddit a couple of years and to see news this big so late in the relevant reddits is quite new
SubredditDrama,removed,go fuck yourself shitty mod
SubredditDrama,removed,careful you dont choke to death on that muslim cock
SubredditDrama,removed,i highly doubt the thousands upon thousands of censored comments were all hate speech
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off and die muslim bitch i love how this is blowing up in your face fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,aka we dont want to hurt muslim feelings and our liberal srd agenda so lets bury this
SubredditDrama,removed,who the fuck you nerds there are and counting people dead oh boo hoo news cencored you there are now threads because they are dumbasess the world doesnt resolve aroundt a dumb site get some perspective
SubredditDrama,removed,jesus what a shit mod
SubredditDrama,removed,what a child you are pathetic little bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,you muslim fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,it never ceases to surprise me these days with reddit i went back to old mass shootingviolence threads to see some comparisons anders breivik breivik declared insane and unaccountable for attacks makes me proud of my country edit of the occasional progress in human morality and ethics a justice system where revenge isnt the motivating factor for punishment is certainly something to be proud of one of the big achievements a society can make thank you this is the correct punishment rehabilitation and treatment not punishment and hate breivik declared sane i am a bit disappointed in the comments so far calling him a terrorist calling for the death penalty or calling him a cnt i am not directly disputing the semantics of whether he is a terrorist or a cnt i just think they divert attention energy and understanding away from the fact that breiviks actions highlight social problems that we like to ignore we should be talking about how our society allowed anders to become so isolated and jaded with regards to other cultures we should delve in to why he felt that the only way of making a difference in the world was to kill innocent people it may be a symptom of the fact that the idea of a community is lost in large western cities it may also be that the education system makes no room for understanding other cultures and helping kids see past the obvious differences to the shared humanity it may also be that the political systems with which average people have to influence the direction of a country ie throwing a vote into the paper pile disarms the passionate and stifles the options they have to explore their thoughts i am not trying to excuse what breivik did but we need to look past the evil in what he did and past the names with which we define it and see if we can learn something about ourselves and the way we live from his actions for every man that thrashes out in an act of violence against a system that stifles him there are many more brilliant passionate people that recline into apathy after their voices fall on deaf ears isla vista shall we blame this on affluenza as well this was a very disturbed young man had he gotten the affection and sex he so desired he would have still been a psychopath his rejection whether real or imagined was simply his trigger to act on thoughts he was already harbouring you judge this man and you judge that his rejection and possibly life alone would not have effected his mind or thoughts by saying something so ridiculously you show youve never even taken an intro to psych course we are shaped greatly by our surroundings specifically our social connections we are a social species a species that uses solitary confinement as one of the worst punishments some of us live in solitary confinement through no choice of our own and it does cause significant mental health issues if you believe otherwise you are lying to yourself and frankly ignoring all the evidence its interesting how carefully reddit seems to be avoiding discourse about how he was a bitter entitled mraciting misogynist why isnt that being discussed i mean we all know but id love to hear it from someone else ive been looking for this same discussion this mentality of i am a nice guy so why wont these stupid sluts wont give me the sex i am rightfully entitled to is prevalent on reddit id say the odds are high that he was a mraredpiller doubtful since the shooter expressed fantasies of male genocide he posted in if you could release a virus that would kill every single man on earth except for yourself because you would have the antidote would you do it you will be the only man left with all the females you would be able to have your pick of any beautiful woman you want as well as having dealt vengeance on the men who took them from you imagine how satisfying that would be i mean id put a lot more stock into mental illness than his mra ideas in terms of what to blame but imagine if it was an article about a woman murdering men who checked her out i can only imagine the antifeminism generalizations and see men are oppressed discussions that would dominate the comments chris dorner they fucking wacod him say what you will about dorner and his actions but im of the point of view that the police have no fucking business setting people on fire no due process murderer or not the fucker had rights nbc in la has been saying for hours a sniper took him out then the cabin burned down after media outlets were ordered to vacate of course murderous cops on a vendetta and they will get away with it its perfectly constitutional to use lethal force when necessary in a situation where someone is holed up armed and already shot two officers in the shootout the law doesnt require that nonlethal force is used to ensure his due process rights youre absolutely right but i dont think setting them on fire is technically necessary til burn it down is a swat tactic baltimore riots hey guys lets protest the wrongful assumption that black people are criminals and need to be dealt with extreme force by performing crimes and assaulting people thatll teach them and destroy our own neighborhoods where were going to have to look at everyday lifes hard out here in the streets its a rough lookin place i wish someone would come along and help us fix this they shot that guy i never met flip over some cars and burn down a business lifes hard out here in the streets its a rough lookin place i wish someone would come along and help us fix this orlando nightclub mods started nuking everything once fbi confirmed he was muslim well we wouldnt want to offend anyone by criticizing islam would we better to censor all discussion about the greatest largest mass shooting in us history i find that more offensive than anything a radical islamic terrorist does something so in order to not offend muslims they censor it theyre basically saying that all muslims are radical terrorists awful one of the mods is an islamist and it isnt the first time something that doesnt fit his narrative got nuked over there lets see how long this inconveniently counternarrative actual news lasts here what is the narrative that theyre trying to push theres so many deleted posts i cant make heads or tails of this shitshow they are trying to prevent antiislamaphobia by censoring or making any comments on any posts that include these topics impossible as if there is something wrong with disliking a religion religion isnt race being islamophobic racism
SubredditDrama,removed,yup real blatant too as loads of others can attest so how about you eat a baconwrapped dick and show yourself out
SubredditDrama,removed,yep wouldnt be surprised if you were the one deleting all of those comments along with urnewsmod i also wouldnt be surprised if you were the one logged into that account to try and cover your ass
SubredditDrama,removed,the fact that clinton supporters have said that they are scared to reveal that they support clinton would also affect this outcome
SubredditDrama,removed,why not after an mass shooting then why only when mass shootings are committed by muslims is this the position srd takes it doesnt due this when the shooter is white does it see charleston
SubredditDrama,removed,hillary clinton wants to import a minimum of syrian refugees to the us of which admit to having positive views of isis source the arab center for research and policy studies more muslim opinion polls
SubredditDrama,removed,wat occams razor doesnt work here neither situation is less complex than the other either all deleted comments break the sub rules or all the mods got together and decided to enforce some agenda also that level of bigotry isnt unique to rnews go look in the askreddit thread there are plenty of bigoted comments
SubredditDrama,removed,why is there only one subreddit for posting this though hillary clinton wants to import a minimum of syrian refugees to the us of which admit to having positive views of isis source the arab center for research and policy studies the number one reason for supporting isis the studys words not mine is due to islam but the study split islambased answers into two so it didnt reach the top more muslim opinion polls
SubredditDrama,removed,evil is as evil does
SubredditDrama,removed,delete your account
SubredditDrama,removed,literally hitler last time someone did something like this hitler invaded france umasterlawlz please yell at this person
SubredditDrama,removed,the faggotry of a redditor is directly proportional to the number of congratulatory acceptance speech edits they make
SubredditDrama,removed,came here to say this its not just that sub though its all of reddit womens opinions get shouted unless they agree with some bizarre disgusting missoginistic mra viewpoint and then all of a sudden its ok the blokes at askmen could actually learn something if they just listened
SubredditDrama,removed,wow what a surprise another power starving reddit mod
SubredditDrama,removed,if you dont think this is srd material youre delusional incompetent or lying
SubredditDrama,removed,luckily a gun ban would never work in america nor should we try were not sheep like you when given the proper respect guns are very safe id rather my life depend on a gun than a knife any day
SubredditDrama,removed,no we should be advocating for better mental health funding and services to help gays be attracted to females and vice versa sexual orientation includes the attraction of animals attraction of children you want to encourage peadophillia gay conversion therapy works it should be encouraged being gay is a mental illness only recently it was changed due to lobbying in the science industry just like how gm is being pushed
SubredditDrama,removed,im not homophobic i dont hate gays but i believe its a mental disorder i have many gay friends many scientists believe being gay is a choice im sorry that you dont believe in the method of science and it goes against your opinion but i respect yours why cant you respect my opinion
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont want to take away peoples civil rights for the of people dying from guns you daft cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,guns arent a human right they are in american maybe you should pass civics first class before spewing autism in this thread
SubredditDrama,removed,just because the constitution guarantees it doesnt make it a human right theres a difference right a human right is what usnotbowst decides it is when he wakes up in the morning im calling you an autist because thats what you are
SubredditDrama,removed,are you going to respond to anyone you fucking stupid piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,i only care about idiots who make incorrect statements dont respond to anyone who corrects them and dont edit their incorrect comment youre spreading misinformation you uneducated fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,or maybe men are told they can do anything and have it all while women have to choose between career and family no one cares about a dad missing his sons baseball game because he was at work mom missing though worse mom ever and is judged by everyone why do you think we have terms called working mom we dont say working dad we just say dad women often have to put their career to the side because of societal expectations
SubredditDrama,removed,im not trolling but honestly if women are paid less than men shouldnt they pay less for services that seems fair to me also your comment above said an eye for an eye is not the way to go but what is the way then a lot of people are dismissive to sexism until it happens to them
SubredditDrama,removed,care to explain why
SubredditDrama,removed,im gross because i want to meet as many people and make as many friends as possible youre a fuckin moron dude and how is calling me gross not shaming how is different from calling a girl a slut for having lots of sex
SubredditDrama,removed,holy fuck i wish i could throw popcorn in uconfusedash face i dont like this at all
SubredditDrama,removed,not a purebred most likely going to be euthanized but thanks for your help first we got confusedash and the kid she hates and now we got uhrpuffystuff why are the assholes being posted to drama today
SubredditDrama,removed,definition cuckold the husband of an adulteress often regarded as an object of derision you learn something new everyday some thanks would be appreciated took me a whole seconds to do this for you
SubredditDrama,removed,wow tell me more
SubredditDrama,removed,this is evidently the new retort for you morons telling triggered sjws to fuck off apparently means youre offended you guys always come up with the lamest shit i always imagine you neckbeards smirking and adjusting your fedoras as you type this tripe out
SubredditDrama,removed,wow tell me more
SubredditDrama,removed,srd believe the victim unless its a chad reeeeeeeeeeeeee
SubredditDrama,removed,im not saying it its what other people smart people are saying
SubredditDrama,removed,now imagine these were black brazilian players in plain clothes being drunk and assaulting a security guard in some random gas station in the us redditors of course would be all like play stupid games win stupid prizes and id shoot them too tbh
SubredditDrama,removed,boo fucking hoo indeed minorities have been talking yelling screaming protesting demonstrating writing crying despairing suffering these issues for decades and white america never gave a fuck because it didnt affect them that much it wouldve been nice for the white working class to show up during the civil rights movement or when the black panthers proposed socialism when cesar chavez was trying to unionize workers when feminists were fighting for equal rights and equal pay now white working class is getting buttfucked by the economic policies they voted for the last years but it was great as long as niggers spics and gooks got fucked right weve lived this shit the entire time fuck you and learn to live in poverty like the rest of us pull yourselves by your bootstraps tighten those belts raise your children and work hard motherfuckers life aint fair deal with it
SubredditDrama,removed,attitudes like yours are exactly how a guy like trump has become the republican frontrunner this election nah fuck that noise the tea party fanned those flames the last years fox news has been pouring gasoline on that fire since the rush limbaugh spewed his toxic fumes since the nixon and the republicans used the southern strategy in the lee atwater goldwater et al to the and earlier poor white people have been told for decades that we minorities are taking the source of their problems long before the current identity politics came into the mainstream trump is the logical conclusion to your rhetoric you did this to yourselves
SubredditDrama,removed,how much of a paranoid schizophrenic do you have to be to think an entire race has been holding back another for centuries i will admit yes maybe a small minority may have had something to do with it but you cant say all white people are evil for that fact if thats the case all blacks should be locked up or sent back to their homeland of africa since a large portion of them commit a majority of the crimes here if america is sooooooo bad then leave already i will gladly pay for your ticket out of here if your that delusional
SubredditDrama,removed,so again free pass on whitey it sounds like blacks are being too thin skinned if they let words hurt them this is a neverending cat and mouse game where blacks always feel oppressed and no matter what whites do its never enough if its really that way then leave your race was brought here on less than good terms and no one is forcing you to stay so leave if its that bad
SubredditDrama,removed,comments from your post history why doesnt the title mention the fact this was done by black men fucking niglets fucking nignogs have literally zero self awareness let it go you must be a nigger too do you actually believe youre not a racist serious question
SubredditDrama,removed,as soon as i saw this casting move i immediately came to srd knowing that rmovies would be ablaze reddit is so predicable
SubredditDrama,removed,im seriously starting to believe that tumblr has contributed to the decay of various feminist issues take the idea of mansplaining for example in the context that tumblr has put it inas a thing to call people out on or rant about afterwardsit has very little or even negative utility value bestcase scenario you commiserate about it online or with friends some utility in the emotional release and common experience but the word itself doesnt necessarily contribute to this utility worstcase you shout it at the other person and use it to ignore what theyre saying since mansplaining deals primarily with intent its primary utility comes about through introspectionam i explaining this to her or explaining it more simply because shes a woman using it as an external label discourages this use of the concept by demonizing the word and making it into a pejorative im not sure how to reclaim these words and i honestly believe the feminist movement has been set back by decades in these areas due to their misuse
SubredditDrama,removed,you a mind reader dog
SubredditDrama,removed,so if i want to trick you into thinking im reasonable and worth listening to all i have to do is be polite gotcha do you think perhaps my good sir that the white supremacists saw suckers like you coming a mile away and have carefully tailored their delivery to trick suckers like you into thinking that theyre reasonable
SubredditDrama,removed,im willing to bet that guy is one of those people who thinks minorities can never be racist no matter what
SubredditDrama,removed,ok punkin you keep ranting about the soft sciences and ill be over here in the real world
SubredditDrama,removed,yes me mocking you is uncontrollable rage you got me great job
SubredditDrama,removed,fyi you are defending a nazi who is trying to shoehorn his own worldview of warring racial blocs into tes he says nearly identical things about the holocaust needing to exterminate jews because they are predisposed to attack christians and subvert nations
SubredditDrama,removed,thats because gypsies are honestly the worst people that exist anywhere in europe round them all up inside some balkan country build a wall and throw away the key
SubredditDrama,removed,be a prick even more
SubredditDrama,removed,go ahead and delete that comment aswell just so you can claim i started insulting you first
SubredditDrama,removed,of course some fucking srs puppet sub would link my comment
SubredditDrama,removed,no this is a completely different story srs is a cancerous sub that has taken over many subreddits with its hateful ideologies including this one they are guilty of vote brigading harrassment death threats and doxxing and there is no reason they wont do that to me
SubredditDrama,removed,its sad that you are so pathetic as to think you are right you are wrong and not only are you wrong but the entire argument is the inexperienced uneducated bickering of ignorant children
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,srd was taken over by srs
SubredditDrama,removed,so being a mens right activist and teen makes me less of a person also yeah the pussy pass is based on sexism its just the kind of sexism that feminists dont want to get rid of
SubredditDrama,removed,i would advise you to read this
SubredditDrama,removed,lets take that as true that men are predisposed to be rapists we still get to choose how we behave its still our responsibility what we choose to do
SubredditDrama,removed,screeching i heard cries of why do people keep shifting us
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,only when the victim is a white male introvert though otherwise its just funny
SubredditDrama,removed,is this a biotruth then
SubredditDrama,removed,nazism is a legitimate political belief you are the real racist for hating white people by not supporting nazis ill just finish this out with a big ol dae blm is the kkk
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit in general is pretty right already on issues of male privilege lets not kid ourselves here
SubredditDrama,removed,wouldnt be reddit without some young men competing to see who can be le edgiest
SubredditDrama,removed,omg sorry i shouldve been completely thorough for your delicate sensibilities
SubredditDrama,removed,lol not a commie but my friend works with this barber that is enamored with putin because russia doesnt tolerate liberal faggotry he posted a long post on instagram about how north korea is probably good and kim is probaly a good guy because everything the liberal media says here is a lie
SubredditDrama,removed,why should we excuse it because if youd been born into that culture youd likely have done the same thing its the same reason it is unfair for white westerners to judge the islamic world so harshly today why do you keep shifting the argument instead of acknowledging where you were wrong that doesnt seem like something a historian would do i wasnt wrong given the context of the time i dont mind the fact that william ford happened to own slaves it is not something which surprises me or offends me that was just what wealthy white men in the south did back then and it is ridiculous of us to expect anything different as he was not the one who enslaved northup or any of his other slaves i fail to see how that implicates him in treating them like property obviously you dont know any historians perhaps check out this thread for more understanding
SubredditDrama,removed,i wish someone would ask me this id probably just respond with something stupid like nig just to fuck with them
SubredditDrama,removed,why do i get the feeling that this guy is also voting for trump
SubredditDrama,removed,what a moral person
SubredditDrama,removed,snapshots this post httpsnpredditcomrislamcomme i am a bot rsnapshillbot messagecomposetorsnapshillbot
SubredditDrama,removed,im triggered muh muh brigade
SubredditDrama,removed,the difference is that rthedonald is a place for trump supporters if you went on rsoccer and called them a bunch of pansies playing a faggots game theyd ban you in a heartbeat but soccer posts dont deserve to be banned in rsports
SubredditDrama,removed,ooh a cuck that a woman nonhamplanet woman would never touch even better
SubredditDrama,removed,suck a bag of dicks
SubredditDrama,removed,as a member of the same oppressed class i have zero hesitation about criticizing her you can do whatever as a member of the same oppressed class i guess me as an outsider couldnt possibly bring myself to do it
SubredditDrama,removed,i honestly dont blame white nationalists modern liberal society seems increasingly interested in blaming white men for every problem while simultaneously pushing for every other kind of racial pride and power other that white i dont identify as a white nationalist myself but i like to try and think of the world from everyones perspective from a white nationalist perspective their race is in danger every other race has a historic homeland that is almost completely racially homogenous and will stay that way both europe and america are becoming increasingly filled with so called minority groups and anyone who wants to try and start a dialogue about racially homogenous society which are proven to be better and more stable as a whole for whites is immediately shut down by being called a racist nazi ect i dont really know what to believe on the subject its very complicated and shutting down discussion of the topic by attacking anyone with white nationalistic opinions doesnt help at all
SubredditDrama,removed,i know your life is hilarious
SubredditDrama,removed,its true though look at the racial metrics of china foreigners dont even register as a fucking percentage or saudi arabia arabs afro asians whatever the fuck that is south africa is black and thats by far the most diverse country in all of africa the media is constantly pushing for diversity in successful western nations you never hear about how any asian or african countries need to me more inclusive for us white folk i try to be a raceblind as possible myself but i cant be culture blind multiculturalism is objectively a sham there are inferior cultures that simply do not mix with ours and there is truth that a racially homogenous population has less problems just think about all this black lives matter civil rights shit thats happened none of that would have happened if america had been racially homegenous
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,this is actually completely false it goes mobile pc consoles ill find you some sourced statistics when i wake up tomorrow
SubredditDrama,removed,if it where me id just go in the database and delete anything and everything involving thedonald months ago umrpenguinx comment history is mostly in anime and japanese toy subs you cant make this shit up i could sense the weeaboo in your comment before i even clicked on your name
SubredditDrama,removed,you just made my point the reason africa is such a shithole is precisely because of the tribalism among smaller ethnicities the sheer face that even these very racially similar populations have trouble getting along says a lot about multiculturalism inbreeding isnt a problem especially since im talking racially not ethnical homeogenity in the white race you have aryans anglos slavs scandinavians while a nation comprised solely up of these ethnicities would not be completely free of ethnic conflicts it would definitely be free of the massive racial problems america has today and thats exactly the problem right there white people dont want to live in africa its frankly a shithole and its not a race thing its mainly a culture thing african cuture is fucking shitty and theyll never get anything done white western culture has crafted the entire modern world of course they wouldnt want to go live in africa and im not against the idea of a multicultural society i just think that the very idea of a white racial state shouldnt be completely thrown away as racist drivel birthrate issue is laughable economic improvement and tax incentives for parents who have multiple children and remain married until the children are importing third world immigrants will not solve the birth rate problem but replace the native population with an entirely different cultural and ethnic group that dont hold dear the same values we do
SubredditDrama,removed,wwii was caused by a lot of history and ethnic conflicts and im not denying that there still wouldnt be ethnic conflicts in a theoretical all white state but the problems would be of a much lesser magnitude than we see today just go to marseille in france to see how well multiculturalism and immigration has worked out ive seen it for myself lets stop you here and ask what exactly do you know about history in africa or african cultures because you honestly havent given me a statement about either that i cant read from any illiterate sixteen year old on pol ranting about his thinly disguised feelings of sexual inadequacy towards black men lets see i know theyre still less advanced than many ancient civilizations i know many of them believe killing albino children gives them magic powers i know many believe that raping young children cures aids i know that the only once decent country in africa is currently being turned into a shithole by africans i find it absolutely hilarious that you automatically make this about sexuality im not talking about skin color here im talking about culture there have been great acomplishments from black men who embraced white western culture i am not kidding here absolutely nothing of worth has ever ever been created by african culture its a fucking worthless shitheap and the world would be better if theyd all just fucking die already so nobody wastes any more time and money trying to help them the entire continent is complete fucking garbage so many resources and potential and its all fucking wasted and its not a racial thing its been proven that africans can be very smart its a culture thing their culture does not value freedom it does not value individuality creativity progress right and wrong innovation because their culture is completely worthless and stagnant it is completely impossible for them to ever become anything of worth unless there is a massive cultural shift youre telling me that the vague proposals are sufficient to make having three or more children economically viable for whites in europe and america how is it vague tax incentives for couples who get married have kids and stay married until the kids are grown up very straight forward i dont know the exact amount but it should be enough to make having children an advantage rather than a disadvantage nobody is having kids specifically because it is now a huge disadvantage in todays society an economy
SubredditDrama,removed,how so im talking about a reduction of violence not a removal if there were no africans in america there would be less racially motivated conflicts thats a simple fact you know i was going to come up with some witty comment but honestly i dont see the point now is there any part of this following paragraph you didnt pull out of your ass how exactly am i supposed to respond to a guy who apparently thinks there are ancient civilizations with access to cell phones i hate to say it but youre a dipshit a fucking dipshit who developed cellphones dipshit who developed the infastructure so that african countries can use cellhpones dipshit who built the cellphones and shipped them to africa dipshit where are all the african cellphone companies dipshit where are all the african tech companies dipshit where are all the successful non shitty african nations dipshit jesus christ man smarten up african culture didnt make cellphones western culture gave it to them just like everything else they have if it wasnt for western civilization theyd still be all be living in huts oh wait most of them still do because their culture is fucking useless all the infastructure in their counties was built for them and what do they do do they improve it no they fucking ruin it because african culture is objectively shit and you cant prove me wrong because literally nothing good has ever come out of the shitheap of a continent and if you had the fucking brains dipshit to read my earlier posts youd have fucking seen that i mentioned economic problems had to be fucking solved as well because they are the fucking source of the fucking low birthrates and wasnt the whole reason you were saying we need immigrants is because our low birth rates were causing economic decline so shouldnt more fucking babies mean an economic boom of course you cant be fucking expected to use fucking logic and reason why should i fucking expect that
SubredditDrama,removed,holy fucking delusions batman poverty has risen in nigeria with almost million people living on less than a £ a day despite economic growth statistics have shown the national bureau of statistics said of nigerians in were living in absolute poverty this figure had risen from in those arent african tech companies theyre built using western infastructure and technology most of them are probably owned by western investors none of that could have possibly been developed without western assistance what is that map supposed to mean how many countries on that map would you feel comfortable living in let alone raising a family in oooo oooo i know this one they get caught up in cold war politics and their country is destroyed in a civil war where both sides of the conflict are funded by the us and the ussr well thats what happened to ethiopia anyway seriously though that comment is a complete fabrication africa was home to many successful and important trade hubs universities multiethnic polities and major citystates all with welldeveloped infrastructure hell the ajuran sultanate exerted control over the nomadic peoples in the hinterlands by controlling access to their welldeveloped waterways and irrigation systems oh im sorry that cant be right those people were africans what i meant to say was louis ix came over and built that shit for them we was kannnggss nnnn shiieeett look im not going a thousand years back into history to discuss an ancient african empire founded by arab conquerers because at some point the arabs also had a decent culture going on im talking about the current year in the current year african culture is for the most part shit and worthless without outside help and more often than not even with it they cant do shit but yes just blame the evil capitalist us for not allowing communism to dominate the planet and well all be fine aryotopia i find it amusing you dont realize not all white people are aryan see this is the kind of forward thinking that can only come from a white man living in the west the greatest and best civilization to ever civilize the entire reason you can even argue with me about this is because a white man invented a computer and a white man invented the internet this has nothing to do with race rather the culture that was developed due to a number of extenuating circumstances over thousands of years and through numerous conflicts white people dont have a monopoly on invention or intelligence but white culture has had a domination over innovation for the last few hundred years during which weve grown by leaps and bounds as a species specifically because of its unique benificial traits i personally wouldnt give a shit about race if it wasnt so heavily tied to culture potentially smart teens in ghetto communities are bullied by their black peers if they try to get an education because it aint nigger which is completely against their own self interests people will often deem you a race traitor if you adopt the culture of a racial group other than your own especially if the culture you come from is vastly inferior and pretty stupid all ive been saying this entire time is that it wouldnt be a terrible thing to have a country made up of about white people can you explain to me why thats such a terrible thing
SubredditDrama,removed,as an engineer take my advice get a job and grow up and listen to your elders learn where the money comes from that keeps your fat ass fed
SubredditDrama,removed,wow i really nailed it with the tryhard crybaby tag
SubredditDrama,removed,i disagree i dont think niggers are as unevolved as you folks claim

SubredditDrama,removed,have you ever seen surf ninjas httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvullwmfpeoui is the trailer
SubredditDrama,removed,use to follow this icefrog drama some years back came across these links httpicefrogtruthblogspotcom
SubredditDrama,removed,i need to know icefrogs name so i can tell him nerf slark or snip snip on tiwtter gamergate
SubredditDrama,removed,its absolute amazing that it was a real trailer genuinely produced by the movie studio
SubredditDrama,removed,sure
SubredditDrama,removed,so what was icefrogs real name anyone pm it to me
SubredditDrama,removed,if you go into utryndamere s comment history you can see his name anyway thus far he hasnt editeddeleted his comment which is pretty scummy
SubredditDrama,removed,for those wondering this isnt really anything new its on the dota wiki page this rumor has been around for a long time and most people dont really believe it
SubredditDrama,removed,i have so much respect for the someone who is a mod of two quarantined subreddits
SubredditDrama,removed,thats damn impressive im working on becoming the mod of as many shitty subs as possible on one of my alts well see how far i go then ill nuke their css or just take it over and post pictures of cute kittens
SubredditDrama,removed,i think you linked the wrong image
SubredditDrama,removed,oh
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,why are they so angry i dont understand
SubredditDrama,removed,its pics not childfree or one of those subs i dont frequent any of the defaults other than askreddit are they all this shitty
SubredditDrama,removed,right who has an so of years and regularly posts on aa
SubredditDrama,removed,that sucks ill stick to jerking it in the depths of reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,yes one of the mods
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont understand that wasnt an argument that was a slapfight between two blind deaf amputees
SubredditDrama,removed,uh sorry didnt notice youre a rthedonald user go concern trolling somewhere else
SubredditDrama,removed,i like this idea
SubredditDrama,removed,shhhh thats the point ill create derision in the ranks and seize power in the confusion
SubredditDrama,removed,protaxes i dont understand why anyone would take this stance it is absolutely unconscionable the existence of taxes is just government sponsored theft if we all join together we can force change just as mlk and ghandi made great change with protest we can to join us and stop paying your taxes dont be complicit in your own burglary
SubredditDrama,removed,nah this is the fastest someones ever noticed my flair ive led people on for dozens of comments before they notice i try not to do it for too long lest i get banned ive only gotten banned a couple of times
SubredditDrama,removed,shit im vargas i knew i had forgotten something
SubredditDrama,removed,i just need to know his password uvargas care to drop me a line
SubredditDrama,removed,oh boy i love rlegaladvice drama there are two completely different factions of the sub that have completely different opinions about the future of the sub i completely agree with the mods being a mod is hard and having to go through all of the threads to find off topic comments is a pain in the ass theyre human and also volunteers also i love the comparisons to authoritarianism im not really sure what people expect but if this is what they think authoritarianism is then theyre going to be in for one heck of a surprise when they have to pay taxes or you know do anything involving the government
SubredditDrama,removed,im being used as evidence woooooohoooo
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks man ps i dont think your flair is going to work
SubredditDrama,removed,hey there just wanna loudly and directly call you out on your bullshit httpimgurcomccyzrou and dont pretend you didnt know about it your own automoderator showed up to call me a faggot also to prove that it happened in case you try to delete it now fuck off jackass
SubredditDrama,removed,hehe you said boobs
SubredditDrama,removed,call somebody a cuck or a nigger or even better both racial slurs wont scare me i participate in subs with literal nazis just out your agenda here or not at all
SubredditDrama,removed,call somebody a cuck or a nigger or even better both racial slurs wont scare me i participate in subs with literal nazis just out your agenda here or not at all
SubredditDrama,removed,the only reasonable response to an outrage culture is to be outrageous milo yiannopoulos
SubredditDrama,removed,if women want equal rights they can have equal lefts too
SubredditDrama,removed,knowing reddit theyd probably cheer it on unless he was carrying a pokemon plushie or something
SubredditDrama,removed,is there a strength differential yes its abuse no matter what no its can be selfdefense
SubredditDrama,removed,why the fuck would anyone consult you about this who the fuck are you
SubredditDrama,removed,when i ask a rcirclebroke poster would you kill me if ugodofatheism told you to they always dodge the question it puts their smugness face to face with the lack of morality that most rall readers have within their core theyre forced into the uncomfortable position to either say they would kill me if they believed ugodofatheism told them to which is sociopathic behavior or to admit that they have a sense of smugness independent from rcirclebroke
SubredditDrama,removed,you are part of the problem if you cant see why someone would vote for trumpbrexit then you will never be able to fix it
SubredditDrama,removed,if you think pizaagate has nothing to do with politics youre either a moron on being deliberately obtuse
SubredditDrama,removed,this sub is a safe space son looks at rthedonald and its ban list looks at here hmmm
SubredditDrama,removed,sigh of course redditors would send her death threats her but those shattered some mens worlds i guess
SubredditDrama,removed,most white guys think that they are the victims of racism and it affects their everyday lives they believe that affirmative action and feminism exist to drag them down considering the demographic of reddit it makes sense that most people here despise blm because they are the real racists they post this stuff because they think its distasteful but they can use it as a way to try and claim blm is worse
SubredditDrama,removed,uneronoah believes that all jews should be euthanized see i can project too
SubredditDrama,removed,most likely uspez he was probably killing time while his husband was getting pegged by their bull
SubredditDrama,removed,poop emoji is cute af tho chimps too actually maybe people were complimenting the blacks all along
SubredditDrama,removed,never thought id see users of srd stoop this low
SubredditDrama,removed,neckbeards with no life
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah shes probably the only person who could have lost to trump besides george w bush or cheney in the general
SubredditDrama,removed,its spamming and its also against site wide rules
SubredditDrama,removed,most this is what thedonald does
SubredditDrama,removed,today was supposed to be a special occasion today was the day the admins would pool their meager lunch money to buy a bigobag of select chicken tenders and many bottles of their favorite dipping sauces ranch honey mustard bbq you name it one by one they each gleefully handed out their coins adding to the total of their soon to be cuisine as the last admin handed out his change a problem became apparent they didnt have enough they would have to put back one of their beloved dipping sauces this was a shocking revelation and there was a great weeping and gnashing of teeth but in the end there was only one choice reluctantly they chose to return their coveted honey mustard as they all returned to their safe space moods slightly dampened by the loss they began to cook up their precious tenders of which they had been waiting so long for after many minutes in the microwave seeming as though it was an eternity their fine meal was finally ready as they sat down each opening rall as is tradition there were many loud thuds heard how could this be one admin says this isnt happening says another the shock had fully set in rthedonald was on the front page and their tenders scattered across the floor this day my friends will live in infamy among the admins
SubredditDrama,removed,let me guess youre not a trump supporter you just think trump supporters are treated unfairly
SubredditDrama,removed,oh boy they got triggered real bad
SubredditDrama,removed,and of course the nickname contains a goy the alt rights fascination with anything jewish is astonishing
SubredditDrama,removed,its more like once you subtract the millions of mexicans who fraudulently voted for clinton
SubredditDrama,removed,its not like anyone here would have thought of something remotely original
SubredditDrama,removed,yes it is sorry facts upset you
SubredditDrama,removed,because giving fuelammo to these tards is precisely what they want i know its fucky
SubredditDrama,removed,im sorry i should have been clearer i was ridiculing everyone who watches an unsourced youtube video or random tweet and has suddenly unraveled the truth about the man thedunce routinely mistakes contrarianism for critical thought
SubredditDrama,removed,e d g y
SubredditDrama,removed,you cant be this stupid granted i dont know but i refuse to believe it
SubredditDrama,removed,hey nice front page post i dont agree with you so im going to unfairly kick it down to karma and if you get mad about it youre a thinskinned bitch bye
SubredditDrama,removed,the autism is real
SubredditDrama,removed,the people in here saying the sub should be banned and calling them authoritariansdo you even hear yourselves
SubredditDrama,removed,bash
SubredditDrama,removed,you mean a literal photo of donald trump is more antagonistic than some of the other shit thats hit the front page from the donald please continue sucking the reddit admins cocks harder
SubredditDrama,removed,theyre a troll from thedickwad actually theres a whole bunch of them in here right now i have a chrome extension that lets me see where people post
SubredditDrama,removed,ummm because besides his asshole base most people rightfully despise the fucker
SubredditDrama,removed,black people produce more dirt and diseases than whites
SubredditDrama,removed,no thanks i would rather harass those pieces of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,who cares about thedonald they are just sad human beings the vast majority of reddit had banned them from the front page
SubredditDrama,removed,lol youre dumb
SubredditDrama,removed,ban td and reddit will get cucked
SubredditDrama,removed,cuck kill yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,thats right reddit you fucking cucks
SubredditDrama,removed,that sub is a brigade you moron
SubredditDrama,removed,i up voted everything on rthedonald for about a month just to see how pissed reddit liberals would be worth the time
SubredditDrama,removed,bitchass user name cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,redditcom is literally a safe space try any descent or criticism of bernie sanders and you will be swarmed with downvotes
SubredditDrama,removed,well if you look at the statistics
SubredditDrama,removed,oh the irony a liberal saying someone is incapable of selfreflection is this satire
SubredditDrama,removed,and this is why i will love every second of it
SubredditDrama,removed,wow what interesting comment i am so glad that sub exists and totally do not believe that every active user there should get shot
SubredditDrama,removed,yes we cant have nonliberal voices on reddit how dare they criticising bernie sanders in any capacity is blasphemy on reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,im about to be pushed out ive previously bought hundreds in gold through different accounts and the fact that theyre free to spam with blatant vote manipulation with the admins approval makes me want to take my business elsewhere
SubredditDrama,removed,remember that one time someone criticised bernie sanders on reddit rip karma
SubredditDrama,removed,nah rpolitics isnt a biased nazi echo chamber

SubredditDrama,removed,you used to be able to link to reddit is for freedom of speech banners from the redditcom domain the reason for these banners was so you could link them from your site so that you could promote reddit and its goal of free speech on the internet the site founders themselves stated reddit is a bastion of free speech this site has failed to protect and promote freedom of speech instead choosing to punish it and encourage an environment where we are so divided through selfpunishment that it might as well be a knife edge cut between communities were all the same users were just punishing each other for expressing speech and thats reddit now for conservatives who came here because of the values of american free speech espoused by the site founders its become abomination reddit to us is now a place where when we want to say something reddit tells us you can do that again in minutes

SubredditDrama,removed,woah there calm down tumblr most people used the app because they liked not being judged for their opinions it was about the content of their words not the content of their face the only thing this update does is increase the chances for bullying because now there is a name tied to every post

SubredditDrama,removed,if women are paid less than they should have to pay less for services
SubredditDrama,removed,the metasphere generally has very little problem simplifying and mocking fringe viewpoints that it doesnt like but for whatever reason when communism comes up the comment section is suddenly full of offended people wondering whatever happened to nuance
SubredditDrama,removed,weirdly i get through many online communities without seeing the words anudda shoah i see that kind of shit exclusively on reddit chan sites and gaming communities that isnt a coincidence
SubredditDrama,removed,youll notice whenever commie drama happens rsubredditdrama has a small identity crisis as their notion that being left wing is super cool is attacked
SubredditDrama,removed,you didnt take your medicine today
SubredditDrama,removed,that sounds gay as hell
SubredditDrama,removed,i personally dont think her thigh gap is mildly interesting but i think its pretty lame the dude in the bonus drama is trying to pile on shame to the girl when shes pretty up front about stuff thats the duality of attractive ladies on reddit though theyll upvote your post to the very top and in the comments give each other gold when they call you a whore
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,dae horshoe
SubredditDrama,removed,for you to say that women crave attention as much as men is naïve at minimum attention whores are women overwhelmingly

SubredditDrama,removed,if you think theyre imaginary just walk into my house unannounced id be happy to be the one who caused the death of a worthless faggot russia is a complete different place than the us in case you didnt realize my family is american the equityholders of my parents companies legally force us to have bodyguards paid for by the companies because if anything were to happen with anyone on the family the company would lose a ton of its value and reputation
SubredditDrama,removed,so many salty americunts in the comments
SubredditDrama,removed,americunts are sensitive as fuck they make fun of others not taking a joke but cant stand when its the other way around

SubredditDrama,removed,how dare you give medical advice and yes i noted your weasel words despite my love for the little ferocious creatures i needed to convey your attempt to cast your dismay as well if it was me in a way reddit would understand honey it isnt you youre here solely to to snark on the internet like everyone else only your self image cant fess up to needing to feel superior to some internet rando we get that you think youre an expert on diet having been forced on on as a child you come across like a bad tv commercial dear even yjpigh the disabled are allowed other interests wouldnt know it to look at your comment history
SubredditDrama,removed,how is that armchair youre analysing from dickhead
SubredditDrama,removed,what a shock that reddit can take a fairly mundane complaint and interpret it as this woman is obviously a crazy cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,there is a funny double standard being dissatisfied for cake from walmart is crazy but all those people who went nuts over no mans sky wasnt what they thought it was gonna be arent crazy
SubredditDrama,removed,i also hope you continue to get louder i also hope you continue to get increasingly exclusionary youre probably thinking that any minute now this strategy is going to work yep any minute in the meantime hopefully you can be legislated back into the closet and xey can have some electrodes attached to xer head until they realize xer penis is real
SubredditDrama,removed,im so glad the gov helped pay for my gov subsidized health care thats too expensive for some reason i cannot fathom after all iphones cost more to make but cost less since i have an iphone wow imagine how much cheaper iphones would be if the gov stepped in and helped me pay for one wow what a perfect world i am going to tumblr that while i drink my pumpkin spice latte heheh giggle i dont even feel guilty at all in my indulgence the gov is so amazing is there nothing it cant do teehee ahahahahahahah that is so you ucartinelli careful you dont cut yourself on that edge redditor i feel zero guilt for getting government help to pay for my hearing aid i cant hear without it i cant do my job without it and i do have a job and i do make my contributions so no zero guilt you know what job id like making hearing aids but having the gov step in with guns and forcing people to buy them through a mandated channel that rockets the costs up to that is an awesome job yey gov we could call it the affordable hearing act and people would be like wow that makes hearing aids affordable hearing aids more like hearing aids haha fu
SubredditDrama,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
SubredditDrama,removed,nope sure didnt simply said animals need constant care as well quick someone link this thread to this subreddit

SubredditDrama,removed,oh ive had about accounts banned on this faggot liberal bullshit propaganda center its cute this is your life fucking loser
SubredditDrama,removed,wow whats with those comments it really looks like twox is more about a place for angry men to tell women what their opinions should be rather than a place for women to discuss womens perspectives what happened i dont understand how those comments are allowed theyre just so gross
SubredditDrama,removed,yes this this since it became a default its become a platform for awful redditors to put on display their awful missoginistic antifemminest points of view and mind numbingly stupidly sexist comments i dont understand why redditors think it is ok to have these opinions dont they know its
SubredditDrama,removed,came here to say this it is red pill red pill is extremely dangerous they addvicate rape they addvicate spousal abuse they dont want to treat women like humans they are flat out just to extreme to be taking seriously and they are posting in twox freely there women hating antifemminest points of view
SubredditDrama,removed,but neeeerddss are the real oppressed ones s
SubredditDrama,removed,you come across as very angry im guessing you are one of the dudebros that go to twox to post your shitty opinions

SubredditDrama,removed,white fragility is a real thing
SubredditDrama,removed,as a white straight man racism sexism and homophobia are basically gone well except the worst kind of racism and sexism — racism against white people and sexism against men also theres probably rampant heterophobia based on a handful of tumblr posts carefully curated by likeminded postbigots
SubredditDrama,removed,when did i say racism doesnt exist outside us should have expected that strawman also soldiers of odin are against immigrants not black people so you are saying that the soldires of odin are racist and violent scumbags because of white fragility couldnt you take anything and just say its becaue of white fragility can you not see how meaningless and pathetic it sounds if anything is fragile its you i love how i was initially upvoted but when i didnt go your way all my commments were downvoted it seems like hat with white fragility you are describing yourself and not the racists like soldiers of odin also those people are seen as nothing more than clowns and you thinkíng they go around beating le people of color just shows how deluded and completely out of touch with reality you are i would be embarrassed to say people like soldiers of odin are more privileged than me you need to be a really sad person to think you are below those idiots but cool tell me more about being black you are the global expert after all
SubredditDrama,removed,theyre seeing white fragility in the white people being too fragile to take a joke of course i realise this its just funny how seeing a racist idiot isnt brushed of as as the racist idiot as they are but it needs to be dealt with by circlejerking about all white people and how pathetic and racist they are seems pretty counterintuitive to your against hate efforts no why is there a thing called black fragility you have americans offended by the word black hole and physically attacking whitre people with dreadlocks what do oyu call that exactly is it that black people are just so poor and dumb that they cant help but to act that way us colored folk need white people to defend us and if we dont agree with all the idiocy we are just uncle tom and the token black guy
SubredditDrama,removed,we must be reading a different rblackpeopletwitter cause i see them making jokes about white people all the time about them being school shooters white frat boys being rapists even tho stats show black ppl more likely to rape etc they even have a mod called mglln that basicly constantly makes jokes about white people but starts getting all whinybanhammery when someone makes the slightest joke towards black people sometimes i really wonder if people on srd actually believe this crap that has no basis in reality or just post it to be edgy muh white fragility
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont want to see your racist memes dude oh wow you do know that those memes are based on the fact that americans used to legally consider finns mongoloids right but now you are claimint that finns are white lol httpfinlandtodayfifinnsdonotdescendfromeuropeansanewstudyreveals i have news for you you are the racist not me
SubredditDrama,removed,you should probably hate yourself lmao

SubredditDrama,removed,mras out in force today i aee
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe you should stick to what you know jacking off and video games and let other people discuss things like ethics

SubredditDrama,removed,dont call me mum in front of dave and ill buy you a new toy thats how
SubredditDrama,removed,dude how stupid can you be i clearly understand context im literally discussing context youre just waving your hands saying im an adult and youre not hurr durr you possess no mental subtlety making it hilariously ironic that you think youre more mature than me
SubredditDrama,removed,grow the fuck up you sound pathetic did your parents ever teach you to be respectful
SubredditDrama,removed,implying youre not gook
SubredditDrama,removed,this one of my main problems with reddit youve got a bunch of younger awkward guys who read these stories that are obviously fake to people who get out more but there are so many women are all just looking to accuse you of rape and it will ruin your life stories on here they start to genuinely believe thats how the world works
SubredditDrama,removed,you just used gay as a slur you retard

SubredditDrama,removed,the guy whos getting downvoted for saying what happened was indeed sexual harassment once claimed that looks like another edgy redditor is falling to the dark side of social justice
SubredditDrama,removed,i am surprised there isnt more drama on that sub the autism runs deeps and arguing over stupid pedantic shit is par for the course over there and other pokemon sites
SubredditDrama,removed,dont you have a civilization to destroy and enslave
SubredditDrama,removed,the problem you have is holding the dick up as exclusive male part what makes a women attractive for most people is not her vagina its the rest of her body a straight male cam easily be attracted to a shemale and feel literally nothing floor an actual male okay mac httpimgurcomabbzou take that science bitch

SubredditDrama,removed,or it could just be you are a humorless fuck its like skinner questioning if hes out of touch but then blames it on the children no its fucking you
SubredditDrama,removed,httpsarchiveisqsjvc
SubredditDrama,removed,its not a religious issue its a moral issue most people have an underlying problem rather than just wanting to kill themselves on a whim a problem that can be fixed yes fixed by calling a useless hotline people just copypaste that if youre suicidal pls call this so they can feel like theyre saving lives without any effort even after that all he posted were more platitudes like never give up please dont be that guy
SubredditDrama,removed,but the conclusion is false im not looking for attention no one can tell me i am also the way he got to that conclusion makes no logical sense he is saying because im on here posting my thoughts which are being down voted means i must be looking for attention i cant even comprehend that
SubredditDrama,removed,actually no i didnt thanks for talking out of your ass and thinking you know what my intentions were
SubredditDrama,removed,creative way to deflect
SubredditDrama,removed,no this is what a person who is being wrongly accused would say
SubredditDrama,removed,accused of posting that to piss people off you disingenuous cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,the same idiots who think girl gamers are some manipulative trend to trick men

SubredditDrama,removed,are you implying redditors arent introspective if so what does that mean for you
SubredditDrama,removed,haha okay hoss whatever it takes for you to not have to explain your point right you sound like the republicans did during the obama administration
SubredditDrama,removed,i think that calling weaponized antipathy bigotry and forcing the status quo on people trolling is pretty lazy to be honest if they were doing their harassing shit in real life theyd be getting punched or arrested or something just because its online doesnt make it better
SubredditDrama,removed,only if they also ban the users and immediately squash the other pop up replacements
SubredditDrama,removed,lol they celebrated the attack by wishing it was a trump supporter hunting down the muzzies
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit just like dylan roof and coontown
SubredditDrama,removed,that crossing a line breaking the law i may not wholeheartedly agree that this is the best way it is not an evil way a lot of the country seems to be agreeing in fact the more i actually take the time to read through the order the more i believe this is being completely blown out of the water will it solve the problem probably not completely definitely not immediately its not a terrible thing although i would prefer to live in a country where we can always have open borders for all he did run on one of his promises being that he would do this looking at the state of many european countries who opened their borders to these same refugees the more i can understand trump even opened a line of dialog with saudi arabia to enlist their help in accepting refugees as of yet they have refused to help now they are open to the idea this is a good step in the right direction

SubredditDrama,removed,anything that doesnt involve them is hostile

SubredditDrama,removed,aw using an alt after getting banned is adorable
SubredditDrama,removed,whoooo you know its a good post when all the exiled sexists gang up to brigade
SubredditDrama,removed,jesus you are unhinged people vote for candidates for all sorts of stupid reasons ive met people that voted for bill clinton because they thought he was hot of course there are women who are voting based solely on gender i have a friend who says i realize hrc is a bad person but i want to see the first female president
SubredditDrama,removed,project a little bit more
SubredditDrama,removed,oh of course you forgot you were vote manipulating
SubredditDrama,removed,thats illogical go back to drama little boy
SubredditDrama,removed,whooa props to the op for managing to piss off every sexist holdout from drama theyre brigading from two separate threads thats impressive and yes its totally fucked how many creeps are defending this in here by saying yeah but surely some there may be black criminals but to say all black people are criminals is fucked calling any hillary voter a sexist voting with her honeypot is insulting to all female votes
SubredditDrama,removed,youre lying its on the front of drama
SubredditDrama,removed,thats fine just learn how to express yourself like a mature adult
SubredditDrama,removed,you seriously have to chill out
SubredditDrama,removed,i have actually mostly been sympathetic to you here other than pointing out you were responding to the wrong bot i pointed out how this stereotype has dogged clinton supporters since at least i told you i understand that frustration then i said some some voters are single issue voters
SubredditDrama,removed,i know maybe one day when syrian girls live in a stable enough nation where they can learn to read theyll open their books and be inspired by the first female president of the united states hey she tore their country to the ground but look at this historic moment for rich pompous white liberals
SubredditDrama,removed,succ
SubredditDrama,removed,my god those comments i just i cant even right now it seems that twox has become a place for angry men to take out their anger on women altar her than a place for women to discuss womens perspectives does anyone agree
SubredditDrama,removed,straight men who identify as lesbians the same creeps lesbians have had to deal with for decades
SubredditDrama,removed,you just called me a bernie bro which is incredibly insulting and condescending seeing as how the issues i believe are most important are human read lgbt womens and poc rights
SubredditDrama,removed,you are continuing their arguments so yeah you are equally culpable now please stop insulting me because you dont like my opinion
SubredditDrama,removed,the identity is white and male so thats okay though
SubredditDrama,removed,shh its different and if you dont think so someone will come along and insult you some more
SubredditDrama,removed,of all the different types of people i know my lesbian friends are the most drama filled by far
SubredditDrama,removed,frequent every member of drama
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit the mods called this biased and banned the op permanently
SubredditDrama,removed,what a daft statement
SubredditDrama,removed,if you dont think this post was biased or worth the op being banned tell the mods this subreddit is a shithouse if this keeps happening everytime sexists make a fuss
SubredditDrama,removed,yupp drama brigaded calling people harpies
SubredditDrama,removed,actually i just post in political discussion where we had this cross posted but if you need to believe that go ahead
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit are you ban evading here friendo or is just totally random hapoenstance that your u handle is the exact same concept as uyourepatheticalydumb and you only showed up once they got banned
SubredditDrama,removed,also this is the mod who pulled it
SubredditDrama,removed,check out the mods history
SubredditDrama,removed,the mod who pulled it after another approved it is pro bernie
SubredditDrama,removed,this isnt a line i just think its interesting that it was fine other mods commented in here without issue but the bernie fan gets made and bans the op
SubredditDrama,removed,nah your just being an obnoxious and reactionary kid over a meaningless internet message board you should apologize to tizzores instead of trying to justify your overreaction
SubredditDrama,removed,if he had just pulled it id say maybe he permabanned the op for posting it
SubredditDrama,removed,or youre just a fucking bigot
SubredditDrama,removed,lol you brigade after the post is gone you bernout kids are so cute
SubredditDrama,removed,upper middle class wasps telling black people how they should feel in other news water is wet
SubredditDrama,removed,why isnt the word nigga for us everythings for us
SubredditDrama,removed,white boys just want to emulate the cool black guys without actually having the issue of being black effect them
SubredditDrama,removed,dae black people should just suck it up and not complain when we white folk use a word that has degraded them for centuries freedom of speech amirite
SubredditDrama,removed,because im sitting here responding when people talk to me because youre taking a stance against its importance thats your political objective yeah you care if you didnt you wouldnt have a problem with people saying it is a problem these people have larger problems than figuring out how to be offended figuring out how to be offended i guess a jarhead like yourself wouldnt be able to put two and two together on why a racial slur might be considered not only disrespecting but insulting
SubredditDrama,removed,sure i really dont care if black people are shaming each other for saying nigga though
SubredditDrama,removed,right these guys are such misogynist pigs just because i fuck guys without condoms and dont ever talk to them again doesnt make me a slut
SubredditDrama,removed,from my experience the people who get all butt hurt about wanting to say it are up tight white people that want to grind an axe my brother says nigga all the time around friends or whoever we chill with tarely a couple people tell him to watch himself but if its obvious youre not being hateful and its just part of how you talk it tends to be cool the people who complain wont say it because the word to them is the derogatory form of the word they know thats the meaning for them and are afraid of what people think if they use a hate filled word if someone gets upset when my brother says it he just says my bad if it bothers you ill try to lay off but it is how i talk so i apologize if i do it again just know its not from a place of hate while most of these dudes would be more likely to just get pissy that they cant say it too really its like any type of swearing dont fucking do it unless youre cool with who ever youre with i wouldnt call out to some woman with yo cunt but i may do it to a friend or in that type of enviroment
SubredditDrama,removed,i really dont care what other people say but if it cant be used as a weapon why cant white people say it
SubredditDrama,removed,thats because youre an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,whenever we speak the meaning and impact of our words as well as the boundaries around them are always determined in part by the relationships involved our respective relationships with the subject matter and our relationships with each other in most aspects of our life we understand that and take it for granted black peoples relationship to the word n word has a long and painful history associated with it and theyve made it clear as day that they dont like it when white people use it it isnt nothing plenty of people care and despite what you think people shouldnt say whatever they want there have been rules in place for what people should and shouldnt say since the beginning of civilization its called manners would you talk to an old woman and casually punctuate your sentences with profanity it would be horribly disrespectful if you did its disrespectful for a white person to say nigger it shows that the person is ignorant of the words history or simply doesnt care about it or about showing respect to the people who do care about it youve been told so you arent ignorant if you keep questioning why you cant say the n word if youre white then youre gonna be treated the same as if you called someones grandmother a cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,youve put some neutron stars to shame with the density here
SubredditDrama,removed,because white people cant stand that black people have something they dont have
SubredditDrama,removed,whenever we speak the meaning and impact of our words as well as the boundaries around them are always determined in part by the relationships involved our respective relationships with the subject matter and our relationships with each other again ill ask you to actually think about what im saying and to think about what youre saying pretend youre a child again you are taught that you shouldnt yell fuck at a funeral you are told that its because you would upset the people attending it it is rude and disrespectful to the people who are mourning the loss of a loved one you think about this and imagine what it would be like if the roles were reversed and you understand you would be hurt too this understanding is called empathy maybe not everyone at the funeral cares though everyones relationship to the departed is different maybe one guy hated the deceased and is there out of spite you still wouldnt yell fuck though because there are other people attending the funeral besides him you still wouldnt want to hurt those people you might not know them but you can imagine that at least one of them would be hurt just like you would be in the way you imagined before sparing that one person the hurt is worth it even if that spiteful guy wouldnt care pretend youre a child again you are taught that you shouldnt say nigger to black people you are told that its because its a word that was created by white people specifically to hurt them for white people to label them as different inferior to dehumanize them its existed for a long time for each black person their relationship with the word is different like people attending a funeral might have different relationships to the deceased but there are many many more black people than there are people attending the average funeral all of them are different it makes everything more complicated its harder to empathize but youre asked to be mature about it you might not understand why it hurts so many black people when white people say nigger but you know it does it hurts them enough to get them upset and angry youve been told so you arent ignorant but you keep questioning anyway its not because you dont know its because you dont understand you dont empathize you refuse to thats the difference between you and everyone thats arguing with you you wont imagine being in the shoes of at least one person who is legitimately hurt by the word nigger it could just be one person who is hurt deeply in a way you understand that hurt isnt invalidated because you heard some rapper say it or because the black guys in your unit dont seem to care when you say it youd know that if you tried at all to care but you refuse to you refuse to treat them like people people who deserve respect people who deserve empathy its what the people who created the word nigger did they treated black people differently they treated them inferior they dehumanized them youre like them youre a racist
SubredditDrama,removed,let the tendies hit the floor
SubredditDrama,removed,in a professional setting thats exactly how it works which is the only context being allowed to use a word really makes sense what why the setting being professional changes the consequences of using the word disciplined by hr or even fired but there very much are social rules for nonformal settings theyre just not written ill just call my gay friend an aidsridden faggot next time i see him and yell im allowed to say that when he punches me and leaves
SubredditDrama,removed,f

SubredditDrama,removed,paging admins uspez usodypop usporkicide udrunkeneconomist thats al of them i can remember
SubredditDrama,removed,but this bubba is a rapist and a pedophile
SubredditDrama,removed,lol uglobalglasnost how do you respond to these accusations that u mad
SubredditDrama,removed,so u both mad
SubredditDrama,removed,actually its nothing like that nice reading comprehension skills bud everybody is banned from using the word cuck your massage becomes invisble to everybody but you if you use certain hidden words why does rpolitics do that why not just publicly list the disallowed words why not just answer my extremely simple question instead of personally attacking me
SubredditDrama,removed,what the fuck are you even saying theyve been here for a fucking year and a half my father had open places in his company and they sent a few of them here if they would like it everybody wanted to work in the office and have a huge salary while none of them even spoke minimum english not even some balkan language italian german none yeah call me a racist because im proud of my country and dont want to have hundreds of uneducated goat farmers overpopulating here we have national problems because the unemployement rate is so fucking high half the population is at home meanwhile they spent thousands of dollars weekly on these fucks never knew this sub was as libtarded as sanders supporters you again just spew bigot and racist at me because i was throwing out facts i live in these circumstances and you dont im racist because some guy is living in our country with free housing and food while we have to pay taxes they have no plan on staying here permanently no country wants to accept them they dont want to go back so theyre stuck here we make them fear for their lives are you fucking kidding me there was no criminal activity going on in the fucking town until they came they are threatening the citizens go fuck yourself nonislamophobic bernie supporter
SubredditDrama,removed,roverwatch is a shithole it sucks
SubredditDrama,removed,so do you get paid to post these comments or are you actually this mentally challenged who let you on the computer
SubredditDrama,removed,so this is the sub all the edgy faggots gather
SubredditDrama,removed,again your reading comprehension fails you i didnt invoke free speech lmao i asked why it is shadowcensored you have every right to censor whatever the fuck you want my question is why do you hide the rules and the blacklist of shadowbanned words i know why its because you want to give the illusion of a fair and impartial moderation team with hidden rules and hidden disallowed words mods can street the discussion however they want and nobody is the wiser i would not be complaining at all if it was stated in the rules that cuck cant be used but youre too scared to admit to the subreddit that you control the vocabulary
SubredditDrama,removed,its wonderful that a bernie and trump supporter uberniedearleader can come together to try and silence liberals in the name ofwhat exactly umrseleeks or whatever the name is a die hard bernie supporter from her history and she is colluding with an avowed trump supporter you cant make this shit up both factions are fucking insane authoritarian and dont really like free speechpolitically incorrect speech because they whine like giant babies and do shit like this just because theres a subreddit where people who dont think like them gather go fist each other you two brain dead assholes
SubredditDrama,removed,please answer the question though its fine if you want to censor the word i am not invoking free speech but why not just admit it in the rules also other than cuck what other words are banned its very strange how faggot and nigger are allowed but cuck is not why did you guys choose to ban cuck instead of nigger or faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,it was found that those using the word cuck were more likely to start a shitthrowing comment chain this is not to say of course that the followers of a certain presidential candidate are more prone to brigading and harassing other users but merely that the kind of person who utilises the word cuck in their lexicon of swear words were highly combative prone to aggressive outbursts and generally a nuisance i hope that answers your question it doesnt why not update the rules to reflect that any other words that are shadowcensored it was found that those using the word cuck were more likely to start a shitthrowing comment chain its also used pretty much exclusively against liberals very convenient of you to ban that particular word why not update the rules to reflect that any other words that are shadowcensored need good answers to both bold questions and then you will never hear from me ever again
SubredditDrama,removed,thankyou for taking my time to answer my questions i get the sense that you actually care about the integrity of the subreddit enjoy your day
SubredditDrama,removed,why do white people want to say the nword so badly why do people want to do anything theyre told they cant do flip it around a word only white people are allowed to say ooh racist
SubredditDrama,removed,got any more personal attacks to make you sound more ban worthy than me i have no fucks to give about censoring assholes im proud of that you can join them with all of hitlers book burners in hell
SubredditDrama,removed,haha thats a meme i wouldnt give gold to such a weak retarded faggot lmao hilarious someone did though i posted before they got gold
SubredditDrama,removed,please some black guy born in has not had a unique experience that whites never had this idea is complete bullshit i agree that the n word is vile and dehumanizing why do black people use it
SubredditDrama,removed,phew thank god you know a fallacy or else youd have to own up to how shitty you are
SubredditDrama,removed,now you sound like the other immature prick who had his arms up defending pikeys
SubredditDrama,removed,no youre right a mother of two whose primary breadwinner is her husband is going to leave him the moment he says he wants to fuck the nanny rquityourbullshit
SubredditDrama,removed,at this point resistors already hate her far more than they ever did bush the only answer to why is sexism
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think its overestimated for example people are so afraid of downvotes from autists that they put sarcasm tags on very obviously facetious comments and jokes
SubredditDrama,removed,ets must think really highly of trump for firing his bodyguard and dumping his cheating whore instead of tolerating their behavior like a disgusting cuck
SubredditDrama,removed,dat bonus popcorn thanks fellas
SubredditDrama,removed,not you though youre a special snowflake whos managed to keep eyes on the truth unlike all the sheeple out there

SubredditDrama,removed,yep if anyone would bother to google before resorting to a retarded opinion then they would find the answer easily its always awkward when you point of the terrible things islamists are currently doing and being responded to with bbut the old testament
SubredditDrama,removed,this reminds me of that video where japanese people were asked if its ok for foreigners to wear a kimono and they all said it was a great thing to express japanese culture while nonjapanese people cried cultural appropriation funny shit imo
SubredditDrama,removed,it would make me more comfortable if i could pretend that transgender people werent a thing this does not make me a bigot because im not actively persecuting them i could try for snark here but this shit pisses me right the fuck off how can you possibly justify arguing that people should closet themselves just because youre too fragile to deal with unfamiliar things are you that small and narrow minded its pathetic honestly at least active bigots have the conviction to be honest about their beliefs does it make you that scared and frustrated that you dont get to impose your little corner of the world on everyone else grow up
SubredditDrama,removed,but why do you have to shove it in my face waaaaaaaaah because fuck you thats why trans people used to have to hide who they really were because their very lives were threatened by people that wouldnt mind their own business theyre flaunting who they are because theyre fucking sick of hiding and being scared if you dont like it oh fucking well what you want straight white cisgendered man doesnt matter one fucking bit

SubredditDrama,removed,my mom just loved to take away my privacy as punishment for being moody when i was a teenager guess what it just made me even moodier instead of heading to my room to cool off and avoid saying something id regret i got to sit in the living room while my brothers made faces at me and my sister literally jumped on me and whenever i yelled at them to stop my mom would tell me to lose the attitude and make me sit on the couch even longer without more context i cant really judge the parents in this particular instance but i always get really annoyed when people decide the solution to your kid expressing anger is to just make them more angry it feels more like petty oneupping than actually trying to teach them to behave
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a fucking loser
SubredditDrama,removed,how can these guys get to the point where they literally dont think women have human emotions
SubredditDrama,removed,you dont understand man we are literally oppressing these men by not wanting to have sex with them its not their fault they treat women like sex dolls we drove them to this by daring to be autonomous human beings who dont want to just have pity sex with every man we meet
SubredditDrama,removed,ok this me being real and not being a dick i swear to god this isnt an insult are you autistic like i genuinely need to know if theres an actual neurological thing going on here that may be a barrier because i really dont want to be a dick to someone who actually has a problem

SubredditDrama,removed,alright there are some serious misconceptions going on around here no cats fed a vegan diet will not be miserable confused and sick thats just straight nonsense a cat will be miserable confused and sick and probably die if it is fed an improper diet a vegan cats diet is not necessarily improper i dont know why anyone would try to make homemade vegan cat food because thatd be insanely difficult to get right whats easy is just buying the vegan cat food thats been formulated by people who know what the fuck theyre talking about which provides everything that a cat would possibly need to be healthy theres such an insane amount of ridiculous hate on these threads for what is simply a logical extension objectively feeding your cat a legitimate vegan diet is heaps more ethical than feeding them meat a cat doesnt give a fuck whether its real meat or not as long as its tasty and good for them theyll eat it cats are insanely fussy about their food if theyre eating it unless out of starvation then they like it now i give my cats meat but honestly i sometimes feel like itd be easier to give them the specially formulated vegan stuff because its actually hard to give them a proper diet even with the cat food from the supermarket theres fish in almost every single cat food product at my local supermarkets and if they eat too much fish they get screwed over but fish is cheap what im getting at is there are difficulties either way in providing them with a proper diet but the hard science is not against the legitimate vegan food

SubredditDrama,removed,then why did the pigs get lead poisoning
SubredditDrama,removed,nothing like a trumprelated news story for all the fucking white guys to come out screaming about white genocide and how they dont feel safe literally the safest group from oppression is whining about how they arent safe because people dont like that they elected a fucking moronic demagogue racist sexist to the highest office of the land sometimes reading reddit is like peeping into the alternate universe where everything and everyone is stupid like absurdly stupid someone is going to make a documentary of this post election climate and its gonna be the next fucking waiting for godot fuck you news subreddit
SubredditDrama,removed,wait so americanderp is yoda
SubredditDrama,removed,this might sound odd but this reminds me of the melissa click shit you know the mizzou teacher that was asking to get some muscle over here when dealing with people filming a student protest its the type of thing that normal people such as myself hopefully obviously are upset with but whenever an article was posted about it to reddit i would read the comments obviously everyone was pissed at this lady but if i went more than a few comments deep id start to notice that the comments progressed from generic outrage to too far in the other direction you know from faculty in a university absolutely should not be behaving like this to what do you expect from these crybaby liberals brainwashing everyone at their safe space universities this is supremely fucked up but going from comment to comment you can see it swing widely between normal person outraged at this incident to its not safe to be a white male in america hopefully trump changes that
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry but i have trouble sympathizing you support a literal nazi you run the risk of whatever results from that decision
SubredditDrama,removed,given how fucking stupid the war on drugs has been in persecuting minor offenses and creating more felons i think that the post prison punishments are awful the invisible punishment of being denied employment the possibility of being denied federally funded housing and privately funded housing not being able to vote not being able to own a weapon in self defense etc if anyone wants to know more i beg you all to read michelle alexanders book the new jim crow its a wellstudied approach to how the current system of mass incarceration works in america and its a fascinating read
SubredditDrama,removed,lets be real most of the guys talking like that just have a notverysubtle half chub at the chance for a pending race war and now for something completely unrelated
SubredditDrama,removed,what really gets me is trumpsters posting what the gun control laws are and acting as though the solution to the problem of race relations in america is arming yourself to the teeth its like they want to fuel a war
SubredditDrama,removed,the number of trumpsketeers brigading that thread is upsetting but not unsurprising
SubredditDrama,removed,wait how was it a hate crime
SubredditDrama,removed,the victim was mentally disabled hmmmthat does sound like a trumper
SubredditDrama,removed,at least in prison theyll have access to healthcare
SubredditDrama,removed,eh maybe maybe not i got the impression it was just something they shouted in the passion of the moment not necessarily the initial motivation
SubredditDrama,removed,theres no evidence race played a part in victim selection
SubredditDrama,removed,what
SubredditDrama,removed,obama was the great divider but it wasnt his fault there is a large chunk of racists out there who were fine with keeping their racism behind doors as long as the status quo white people being in charge was still intact obamas presidency certainly changed that in their minds and thats how you get some not so subtle racist movements like the birthers people who support stop and frisk and those who dont understand that black lives matter is about equality under the law and not about saying black lives are more important than any other race
SubredditDrama,removed,i swear a significant chunk of this site just waits for something terrible to happen to a white person so they can find an excuse to feel personally persecuted and start ranting about how evil minorities are
SubredditDrama,removed,the right seems borderline hysterical when it comes to blaming obama sharpton and jackson for white hate crimes like all my conservative friends and family will probably post to fb about how this is one or all of theirs ive seen plenty of shit from the left on this site about dylan roof or some other crime but none of them seem to nearly as hysterical as the right are with obama and so called race pimps anyway i hope the kid is ok and those fuckers get the book thrown at them
SubredditDrama,removed,tying up and torturing an easy target or voting for trump both are different flavors of mental illness but basically both are expressions of weak men doing stupid things to make themselves feel powerful
SubredditDrama,removed,this is frankly what ideological idiots do ideology isnt in and of itself a bad thing our ideology is egalitarian democracy rationality and basic moral virtue the altrights ideology is literal ethnic cleansing its time to emerge from vapid nihilism and pick a side between right and wrong
SubredditDrama,removed,white fragility is indeed on display if you think that white people as some ridiculous cohesive group are indeed under threat after the trump election then i just want you to know that i am laughing at you was it bad this happened yeah its fucking awful its despicable does this mean that white people face systematic oppression no if you think that please open a fucking book on american history and then find out what systematic oppression looks like white people are safe and cozy and privileged as always ever in doubt consult a sociologist
SubredditDrama,removed,i really dont give a damn about the degenerates who support trump
SubredditDrama,removed,ah the old if you replace the nouns the meaning of the sentence changes gag classic context and history matters
SubredditDrama,removed,jesus thats terrible i honestly cant comprehend what was going through those lunatics heads to do that to that man however the double standard pisses me off on reddit there was a very recent case of a black guy with down syndrome repeatedly bullied and called racial slurs by a gang of white guys before being violated with a coat hanger as far as i am aware it didnt inspire anywhere near the same kind of explosive reaction on reddit some redditors even disputed whether it was racially motivated white people who are freaking out over this really fucked up incident need to realize this that fear and angst you are feeling right here that people out there want you dead just for your skin colour is how black people are forced to feel all the time these type of hate crimes happen all the time to black people whereas the last time something like this happened to whites was the zebra murders in san francisco in the what annoys me too is the white guys who already hate black people are never ever gonna shut up about this this one extremely unusual event that is startling because of how rare it is an extreme black on white hate crime whereas its opposite happens so often that a lot of the news stories about it only get covered in local newspapers until they get picked up by black news websites
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you all ima kill myself for this so fuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,as fucked up as it is i understand the torture im a well off white dude and on election night probably would have been down to steal a car and go attack white people if someone gave me the idea i dont understand the comments
SubredditDrama,removed,mike pence already commented
SubredditDrama,removed,this video is absolutely horrendous its a shame that every time i go to the comment section on rnews or reddit in general about a group of black people doing something illegal it always has to turn into some nasty racist shit
SubredditDrama,removed,dude this was a hate crime white people still have power take a chill pill kiddo also take a soc class at your community college educate yoursslf
SubredditDrama,removed,didnt happen
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a judge no dont tell me you know the facts on what this was fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,the left needs to play the same game if it wants to survive get angry get militant not this kind of cruel racistthugviolence militant but the organized and ideological kid of militant so that when the altright whiners complain about those horrible violent lefties we can remind them that violence isnt inherently bad and that democracy rationality and ethics are worth protecting with physical force
SubredditDrama,removed,some random racist criminals torturing some poor soul racist they cant be racist they are black dont tell me we allow this reverse racism white nonsense on rsubredditdrama now
SubredditDrama,removed,hey those are obamas kids you are calling racist criminals
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean thats like saying that racism doesnt exist because obama got elected just because this poor guy got viciously attacked doesnt mean that white people hold societal power and privilege relative to other racial or ethnic groups thatd be absurd to think that it uses a single incident to try and say that a massive social framework magically doesnt exist cmon i know youre smarter than that you couldnt have managed to figure out how to log on if you werent smart enough to figure it out
SubredditDrama,removed,but this mans was white so its at least more tragic
SubredditDrama,removed,multiple unarmed black men get gunned down and people of color are told that everythings fine a disable white dude gets kidnapped and suddenly whites are the oppressed majority fuck this planet
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean really unless youre one of those criminal niggers whats not to like about a genocide they only want to get the bad ones anyway if you look talk and behave like they want you toie as nonthreatening and white as possible youre one of the good ones and wont die anyway jesus you sjw femicucks cant appreciate anything can you
SubredditDrama,removed,these people actually think trump is gonna doi dont even know what reinstate jim crow laws resegregate everything ship everyone not white to somewhere else bu bu but
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit is shockingly racist holy fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,because to liberals some races are more equal than others
SubredditDrama,removed,the thread for the charleston church shooting where people died got about upvotes and comments this one has upvotes with the new algorithm and comments and theyre only going up it seems to much of reddit a blackonwhite hate crime where no one dies is more newsworthy than a whiteonblack hate crime where people die
SubredditDrama,removed,this is prefect timing for obama considering hes headed to chiraq in the coming days for his last speech this event unlike many other politically slanted events after the election is completely organic in nature this is not fake news this is seeing into the eye of the beastsliterally disgusting products of welfare abuse in front of a national stage now but they dindu nuffin
SubredditDrama,removed,im very sympathetic toward the victim or i wouldnt be upset this isnt getting the attention it deserves dumbass
SubredditDrama,removed,this shit makes me so mad im trying to find the comment again but this one guy in the thread straightup said that the left is to blame for the way they acted during the election and it has like upvotes so a guy is racist people call him out on saying obviously racist things then months later some fucked up people torture someone clearly this is our fault and we should just be quiet when people say horrible things
SubredditDrama,removed,dylann roof shoots black people in attempts of starting a race war and an account named after him is modded to rthednald while the main news story fades quickly some kids torture a trump supporter and it blows up with many people using it to justify a black genocide interesting
SubredditDrama,removed,k
SubredditDrama,removed,the entirety of reddit is a seminar on confirmation bias
SubredditDrama,removed,ok ill just copy and paste this comment until youre ready to talk then
SubredditDrama,removed,upvotes gilded reddit wants to believe in white genocide so fucking hard
SubredditDrama,removed,its fucking insane that youre saying this after watching a video of four leftist black minorities brutally torturing someone right wing you are out of your fucking mind and you show absolutely no fucking sign that you are realizing that comments like the viral garbage you just spewed are the reason leftist politics are dying youre a fucking retarded subhuman piece of shit and you are destroying the left i will not have a fucking single thing to do with morons like you the left needs to purge people like you forcefully you need to have iq scores over to be a part of the future democratic party in the usa period
SubredditDrama,removed,vomit pouring out of your stupid fucking leftist lying mouth nothing more if it was black people and a white victim you would be nowhere to be found youre so abominable in everything you do and you actually think youre helping the progressive belief system youre a fucking parasite
SubredditDrama,removed,raltright is racist please explain to me how its racist to not want immigration into our countries when countries such as japan can get away with being very anti immigration and very nationalistic awwww did that that trigger you you seem upset muh not racist mmmugrants raltright who cant get over if everything is the jews or the muslims fault
SubredditDrama,removed,people act surprised that shit like this happens yet completely forget how thislast year started the blm movement came to prominence because of horrible shit the police were doing to minorities before that we already had a lot of racial tension with obamas presidency and many questioning if he could even become president based on him being black before that the rodney king beating happened that sparked riots all over la this didnt just happen people blaming the left for this are stupid and people blaming the right are stupid people forget how much at stake in this election for minorities does this make what these people did right no absolutely not its fucking atrocious and horrible and makes me want to barf but instead of trying to fix it it instantly becomes the blame game as the entire fucking countries politics is starting to become a long conga line of i told you so how have none of these people looked at the fucking history these assholes didnt do this because of media they didnt do it because of its the lefts agenda its because they were fucking asshole people who snapped and decided they wanted to do this trying to figure out why people do something is better then just fucking getting into a shouting match i have two simple messages to the right if you want to blame the left obama whatever for this then you need to step up and realize your own part in it right media and donald trump have antagonized this issue every single one of you that said this is what happens when you ignore the white working class vote completely ignore every other demographic and use the pull yourself by your bootstraps mentality on everyone the only time that was not used was this election that basically tells every minority to go fuck themselves weather thats your intention or not they have felt ignored for almost every election and just because obama became president doesnt meant shit when hes had a republican congress this whole freaking time to the left dont fucking think i dont notice your bullshit a lot of the shit said in that thread are not true but there are some things that are ive found countless liberals countless left leaning democrats countless friends and family that love to talk shit on white people i cant fucking stand it in cali every person ive met who is white has done nothing but try to help minorities and yet have to put up with bullshit from others because their skin color sure you might think its fine but its really damaging its not okay theres always the cliche white people dont know how to make this like one of those perfect white families white people dont understand guess what they do know how to make other cultures food if taught they dont have perfect families and they do understand the answer to this isnt fuck black people or fuck white people its fuck people who do terrible things lets try and stop this from happening again and you dont do that by focusing on i told you so politics alright venting done jesus christ man i feel so bad for that guy
SubredditDrama,removed,even when the evidence is right in front of your face you refuse to believe it because it doesnt fit your agenda wow liberalism really is a mental disorder
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe its time to abuse blacks again lets be real did systematic racism ever end
SubredditDrama,removed,hate crime is most common from people who lean to the left
SubredditDrama,removed,wouldve loved this outrage when the group of white students beat and sodomized with a coat hanger a black classmate and then kicked the coat hanger while it was in his anus after a long series of racial abuse and then walking relatively scott free literally a couple weeks ago the people who did this crime will not walk free
SubredditDrama,removed,wrong im saying produce a piece of evidence no ones sent a single one to me and ive yet to find a single one im not even american you partisan idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont know that dudes wife sounds like a real cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,i used to be a moderate i was registered independent since i turned but as this election took place and i saw an increase in attacks on certain people for attending a certain persons rally i started to see the attackers as enemies of freedom then the media came in they legitimized these attacks by calling a certain man and his supporters nazis i wasnt even a supporter at that time and i still felt targeted because i didnt identify my self with the attacking party now im registered republican and after being attacked and dehumanized more so than my family has for being muslim ex muslim now for the majority of i cant consider anyone who treats people like that as human its inhuman its disgusting and right now it seems to be the go to for progressives what gets me is the fact that nobody on the progressive side ever denounced the attacks outside trump rallies instead they blamed the victims but now theyre all like we dont support this why because theyre hoping people will forget how they behaved in four years so they can get a democrat back into office
SubredditDrama,removed,its showing how much reddit loves money and how much it tolerates some collective behavior as long as they generate traffic
SubredditDrama,removed,this is why i leave reddit entirely for months at a time
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah thats only allowed when trump supporters do something bad
SubredditDrama,removed,i really am you libs have had a rough last few months day after day your narrative keeps getting destroyed you libs are but a shell of your july selves who were so smug and thought you knew everything
SubredditDrama,removed,reading every other line it may seem that way
SubredditDrama,removed,lol fam are you really fucking whining about people being too smug on srd id also notice you never seem to have a problem with people you agree with being smug either
SubredditDrama,removed,but butthe graph he links to isnt included in the brochure he links to not sure if innocent mistake or deliberately misleading but without supporting context its literally just a bar graph anyone couldve made in excel the redpill bro just linked a nocontext graph and implied that it came from some reputable source when it didnt
SubredditDrama,removed,its a new low because the person involved was white and the alt right can only feel empathy for straight cis white people
SubredditDrama,removed,your heart is full of hate and thats sad identity politics and grievance culture has fomented so much hatred lately
SubredditDrama,removed,w e w l a d
SubredditDrama,removed,white people only represent themselves is that why these animals picked a mentallydisabled white guy and tortured him while screaming about donald trump as though as he voted for him or something and please i can do a quick search and find tons of articles tweets and posts about how all white people are racist because of dylann roof or trump or slavery
SubredditDrama,removed,my experience of youtube comments makes me expect that a mentally disabled white teenager probably was a vocal trump supporter
SubredditDrama,removed,the chicago pd just doesnt want to set a precedent of using the hate crime laws against black people but if they dont they make a mockery of the hate crime laws
SubredditDrama,removed,they need to be charged with a hate crime specifically if they arent if the hate crime laws only apply to whites then we have a much more serious problem
SubredditDrama,removed,well race relations are far worse at the end of his term than they were in the beginning
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean it was an isis terror attack targeting gay people and what major religion is actively killing gay people and which one just doesnt want to bake cakes your outrage isnt applied equally thats the problem again in the speech he literally urged republicans to embrace lgbt people but thats apparently not good enough gay marriage is legal and im glad it is theres no more dont ask dont tell and im glad there isnt gay people have equal rights in this country
SubredditDrama,removed,perfect example of the stupid fear mongering on the right especially by the conspiritard crowd that lead us to this shit show of a government in the first place theyve been whining about how trump voters are being discriminated against and are targets of violence all the time and when people out of the tens of millions of antitrump citizens commit a heinous act suddenly their insufferable stupidity and confirmation bias kicks in and turns into this stinking pile of garbage we see in the comments on that article
SubredditDrama,removed,a teller is kind of a servant you mong
SubredditDrama,removed,im guessing the other involves the sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,ah so youre attributing a completely baseless motive to the actions of these people to fit your narrative good show this is why nobody takes you seriously
SubredditDrama,removed,yes because nobody is allowed to get flustered or annoyed if they do so theyre suddenly no longer a nice person you know youre a moron right
SubredditDrama,removed,without grandstanding or anything i think its hilarious how this is the sentiment after a white guy gets tortured i mean god forbid this was the sentiment after pulse or the black churchgoers who got murdered or all that harassment and hate crimes that minorities have to endure after donald got elected just reddit things i suppose
SubredditDrama,removed,wow oxus with you at the helm no wonder this sub went to shit
SubredditDrama,removed,im well aware that this is a circlejerk but some people are a little more thoughtful since the original post string seems to have been removed id rather have the truth seen rather than just the bitesized circlejerk excerpts
SubredditDrama,removed,the laws are applied by far only to cases against whites
SubredditDrama,removed,the evidence is his cabinet which will be instituting his policy and is by all accounts made up of hardright antigayers you can deny all you want but outside of arguing technicalities on reddit nobody will believe you all when you say trump and his administration will not be virulently antigay its transparent
SubredditDrama,removed,td is absolutely out of fucking control with the brigadeenforced narrative pushing i really hope the admins wise up and take some action against that sub
SubredditDrama,removed,dawwww how cute you think youre people
SubredditDrama,removed,so people worried that it wont be prosecuted as a hate crime are totally ridiculous huh
SubredditDrama,removed,and he said in his cnn interview he intends to protect gay marriage if he doesnt do that by all means call him out and ill join in until that point you have no evidence he meaning the president of the united states donald j trump does not intend to protect lgbt rights admit it
SubredditDrama,removed,right posting the truth it flamebaiting according to you typical overzealous mods
SubredditDrama,removed,my account is months old ergo it is an alt account and ergo this is my last chance youre a prejudiced mod on a power trip go ahead and do what you want you dont have any real authority
SubredditDrama,removed,right now being a political phil archiveorg megalodonjp cedditcom archiveis rbadpolitics archiveorg megalodonjp cedditcom archiveis rbadpolitics archiveorg megalodonjp archiveis i am a bot
SubredditDrama,removed,i just find it kinda funny and kinda sad that ireland of all places would have the balls to criticize black people for being violent or having a violent culture ireland giving shit to other people for being thugs this is like if snoop dogg gave you a lecture on the dangers of smoking marijuana
SubredditDrama,removed,rapist pls go
SubredditDrama,removed,you are wrong but keep justifying the erasing of our essential rights all you are is someone who is for a totalitarian state this echo chamber might vote me down for sticking up for the first amendment but i will not stop exercising it go fuck yourself you sheep
SubredditDrama,removed,if you typed this unironically its you
SubredditDrama,removed,not being a bigot is the bare minimum requirement for being a moral human being bud being proud of it is like being proud of showering daily you took kindergarten ethics and built a sense of identity around them and no the fact that many people are bigots doesnt make you not being a bigot more valuable
SubredditDrama,removed,patriarchal gender norms oh so you are an sjw what a surprise you people are almost as bad as trump supporters
SubredditDrama,removed,whitewashing opinion discarded does the guy know that this phrase has been around for a while and is not a spooky sjw invention
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe i just like that you keep responding haha and how you tell me what im doing from behind a computer you must be neo
SubredditDrama,removed,you are even resorting to ad hominem personal attacks actually the only personal attack i can find in this thread is in your comment take that part out and ill be happy to reinstate the comment
SubredditDrama,removed,cucks jimmy status rustled thedonald has an army you cucks never forget it
SubredditDrama,removed,portland is full of hipsters and uzachums not to mention plagued by ujoanwaynegacy its crazy out there
SubredditDrama,removed,you are an idiot just admit it
SubredditDrama,removed,dear ucylinsier unoobit and youre scum this assumed that i hadnt played and i proved him wrong if you dont even have the intellectual honesty to acknowledge that please eat shit and die
SubredditDrama,removed,i am so flabbergasted that he took the time to come in here an username ping me with such am irrational outburst i am scum for not having the intellectual honesty to acknowledge his play time what even the fuck am i supposed to say i am not even talking about how i should feel i cant fathom how to syntactically construct a sentence that acts as a coherent response to that i am dumbfounded
SubredditDrama,removed,i feel like people just bring up pooping in the streets as a way to degrade a nonwhite country thats on the rise and is modernizing very succesfully i dont understand why these same tired jokes would be used still otherwise
SubredditDrama,removed,the dataisbeautiful thread showed that an alarmingly hilariously high percentage of moderators of the following subs thedonald uncensorednews mrtrump asktrumpsupporters nationalsocialism arbeitmachtfrei holocaustdenial conservative askaconservative are moderators participants in the life style of cuckold subs so yeah projecting mate its also why they call everyone faggots and begged that milo to give them the equivalent of a gay pass so they can say theyre not homophobic when they call everyone it
SubredditDrama,removed,most would like it if racists would stop being racist
SubredditDrama,removed,tldr uviolentintenttoday is a vitriolic ignorant unashamedly stupid asshat
SubredditDrama,removed,do you not know how human trafficking and modern slavery operate or are you being paid to not know things
SubredditDrama,removed,how about you stop shitting in the streets then i doubt you would find these comments afterwards
SubredditDrama,removed,so basically shes an average gw commenter

SubredditDrama,removed,thanks for ruining something i was enjoying assholes
SubredditDrama,removed,oh no how many mraneckbeards will spam me here wil you get kia and thedonald involved to help
SubredditDrama,removed,this is honestly the one of the stupidest soapboxes people get on gay men are times as likely to contract hiv than a straight man allowing them to donate blood completely changes the costbenefit ratios for testing blood donations arguing against actuarial tables is a waste of time
SubredditDrama,removed,there are subs dedicated to people discussing it places where people sit and discuss how the world is actually flat people do this remember a few years back when reddit loved telling itself how rational and logical it was what happened for it to become home to flat earth era its facebook forwardsfromcrazytier now
SubredditDrama,removed,when you try so hard on the internet to sound intelligent but just end up spouting some kind of retarded bullshit and looking like a retard
SubredditDrama,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot

SubredditDrama,removed,fyi that guy is a frequent poster in rshitliberalssay so dont expect much valuable duscussion from him
SubredditDrama,removed,whatever you need to justify your bloodlust because people are getting uppity
SubredditDrama,removed,im honored to be featured here im a big fan
SubredditDrama,removed,do you not understand that by rationally and emotionlessly explaining why people should or could murder others with a vehicle you are normalizing using a vehicle to commit murder
SubredditDrama,removed,what a bunch of idiots play on the road and you risk getting run over all sympathy is gone
SubredditDrama,removed,saying there is a chance bad things should happen so its justified when it does is pathetic im sorry this isnt a fucking mental masterbation those are peoples lives i hope you never pass on your psychopathic tendencies through procreation
SubredditDrama,removed,this thread is hilarious those who think the murders are understandable keep explaining their positions further and further as if we dont understand that youre shitty people
SubredditDrama,removed,that poster wants people to be niggardly with their vocabulary
SubredditDrama,removed,annoyed hes calling for murder
SubredditDrama,removed,that isnt how these protests work do any of you think before posting
SubredditDrama,removed,should just take a semi and run them all over whenever i see them set up only if they offend the prophet with their filthy infidel ways
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off seriously you belittle me for telling you not to repeatedly justify murder blocked
SubredditDrama,removed,cunty answer to a good question wtf is wrong with you
SubredditDrama,removed,these people were arrested too they shouldnt be murdered by a psycho with a truck and you posting that youre just emotionlessly rationalizing that makes me wish i cause your monitor to slap you
SubredditDrama,removed,and thats why women dont walk around in skirts too
SubredditDrama,removed,and if black people didnt want lynched theyd stay out of sundown towns its why we have the green book right to protect them
SubredditDrama,removed,you work in high speed road closures not rush hour organized protests either way you dont get to fucking say good at the idea of them being murdered
SubredditDrama,removed,yes the thread youre all agreeing with does
SubredditDrama,removed,no that isnt what you fucking said people said comments like this no i will wait at most minutes for the crowd to disperse before my wheeler goes into low gear with doors locked and begins moving through the crowd are bad and you said theyre on the road they should expect it do you know how sick you sound stop
SubredditDrama,removed,well youre in denial and pathetic
SubredditDrama,removed,youre lying again it needs to stop everyone said the comments calling for murder are terrible and you say no its expected theyre on a road stop
SubredditDrama,removed,when someone cries ad hominem on me i promptly call them a faggot works every time
SubredditDrama,removed,gotta agree with the guy on one thing the i bet youre fun at parties is so annoying like the average redditor saying that is probably not the coolest dude either

SubredditDrama,removed,ubarosa is so upset that he is seeing things threatening to go after renegade by informing his co and citing the criminal charge that you want him to be charged with is a personal threat against him i never said anything about going to his co i never said anything about wanting him charged my comments were i like talking about things out in the open and discussing it with people renegademind is an angry individual who does not represent the veiw of most rational canadians i hope his co takes notice i said nothing about contacting his boss memes usually have words and humor that is our standing prime minister with a noose around his neck beyond being not funny at all that kind of thing in public can get you rcmp attention i was warning them about possible trouble he is open about it and what he posted can result in a charge under section of the criminal code defend him if you like but that makes you complicit what he posted can result so now he has converted that in his brain to note this cuck user is banned for now for making doxxing threats against another user so he wont be responding right away expect a big reeee fit from him whenever i decide to unban him ubarosa

SubredditDrama,removed,so for you a small and literally unnecessary detail it presents the incorrect offhand superficial and stupid way youre resonating if it could be called that at all i dont know if you actually thought he announced her birth or not but the way you just say he did shows how much you care about anything you say being correct or checked
SubredditDrama,removed,i bet hell break ugallowboobs comment and gildings if he makes over comments lol

SubredditDrama,removed,curious what the clinton fanboys will say about this on srd
SubredditDrama,removed,a dialect originating in and almost exclusively spoken by the lower socialracial classes id say the scorn is justified dont agitate society dont further alienate yourself integrate into your host culture as opposed to promoting selfsegregating lifestyles at every turn seems like a good start and there we go also i wonder if this guys a trump supporter
SubredditDrama,removed,u poor bby
SubredditDrama,removed,the thing with these insufferably social justice type like you is that they consider everybody that doesnt agree with them a racist or sexist they use this as a good excuse to be a really shitty human being to people since youre just attacking them for their racismsexism right but in reality these people arent judging you for your race or sex at all they just cant stand you because of your behavior
SubredditDrama,removed,okay sorry
SubredditDrama,removed,i should be shocked that these people are shitty excuses for human beings but redditing for years has dropped my expectations like a rock anyway
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess ill say what were all thinking how would they respond to the sexes being reversed speculate below
SubredditDrama,removed,i wonder if youve ever seen something that someone could construe as racist and didnt think it was against black people of course im sure you see that shit all the time otherwise

SubredditDrama,removed,there is no way youre actually this stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,subscribe this channel
SubredditDrama,removed,i wonder how many times the boogeymen sjws are going to get blamed for trump getting elected the only reason trump was voted in is because you pointed out how were assholes and it hurt our feelings is so ridiculous it gives me a headache
SubredditDrama,removed,this is the exact same kind of logic that gets mocked by defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession youre saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that its not literally illegal to express funny how its the alt text for is so entirely not selfaware to translate it explicitly if the only defense for your moderation policy or tos or whatever is that might makes right and it not being literally illegal that is higher might doesnt care then maybe consider the possibility that you are an asshole so maybe its high time to stop using fully general metaarguments that work for any speech or any restriction on speech in arguments about objectlevel issues
SubredditDrama,removed,this thread has been targeted by a possible downvotebrigade from members of participating in this thread ★ in britain the state mystification is deliberately cultivated through ceremony pomp and tradition in the usa it is cultivated by other means the cult of the president who represents state power personified in essence however every form of state power represents the domination of one class over the rest of society alan woods ★
SubredditDrama,removed,i honestly cant tell whether srd gets brigaded by reactionaries everytime blm gets mentioned or whether white centrists are just this obtuse

SubredditDrama,removed,oh cmon why not give the guy a chance you can be his next girlfriend and then he can wear your skin as a suit
SubredditDrama,removed,the mods didnt delete it until i mdae a modmail and directly rubbed their nose in it and then they linked me to another troll modmail and tried to turn me into a lolcow which was making fun of me before i got there thats cool though you keep acting like this thread isnt directly antangonistic and full of flamebait asshole do you want to know how my day was going i was talking about some fucking subreddit about some fucking movie and some guy my post history and tells everyone about my ex cheating on me do you not understand that dont fucking act like your my freind and browbeat me for lashing out ive probably gotten inbox making fun of me about my ex because of that guy if you want to defend him or that guy who made a thread about it you can fuck sandpaper do you want me to show you my inbox youve seen in this fucking thread people making fun of me have you not that thread linked about my issues wiht condoms and my ex not putting out you saw that right tell me what the fuck that has to do wiht me lashing out right the fuck now

SubredditDrama,removed,how is this not flamebait
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,if the mods delete it it does show we dont accept that stuff here though
SubredditDrama,removed,lol fuck puffin smug shit got a taste of his own medicine
SubredditDrama,removed,why is there so much shit in this thread that i got muted for linking it
SubredditDrama,removed,inciting an angry response is flamebait no direct antagonism insulting no
SubredditDrama,removed,lol i said this would happen hope everyone who was bitching is happy they lose one cool part of their stupid shitty video games imho anyone who plays csgo deserves to have all their money lost on gambling and kicked out of their house get a job
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe you should research about kashmir pandits then maybe i should create a vr simulator where militants come to your house rape you and cut you in half via circular saw lmao hindu nationalists sorry but just because we want a secular society unlike the regressive left doesnt make us hindu nationalists
SubredditDrama,removed,i do cracker
SubredditDrama,removed,thats not how you meme arrow either you fucking idiot kill yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,im giving you permission to consume my fucking spit
SubredditDrama,removed,one of these groups doesnt want a new holocaust though
SubredditDrama,removed,who exactly do the neoprogressives want to genocide the altright definitely wants to genocide jews and black people
SubredditDrama,removed,here is a subredditdrama thread from nearly two years ago that revolves around the fact that i worked in pr at the time so fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,goalpost hasnt changed an anonymous account on social media is not proof of a real life profession you cant get even get past that baseline before we even get into how not all pr jobs are the exact same how personal testimony is useless without some party verifiable evidence etc so make that first field goal and then we can talk or dont its not like anyones going to hold you accountable for bullshitting on the internet
SubredditDrama,removed,people have certainly bullshitted about jobs and professions on this site for longer periods of time youre the one claiming to be the hotshot in pr who knows for certain that the studio behind ghostbusters paid off critics to call people sexist for not liking the movie you should be thrilled to backup your claims
SubredditDrama,removed,well as weve established youre not someone we can just believe out of hand
SubredditDrama,removed,has anyone else noticed an uptick in ableism on reddit or is it just me i have seen the rword used quite liberally lately and needless to say i was pretty floored
SubredditDrama,removed,let me explain youre a smug piece of shit and a half a million people are laughing at your pathetic attempts to troll get a life
SubredditDrama,removed,wait is emma watson good or bad now on one hand she is very attractive but on the other she is a scary feminist so i think she might confuse reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,sure this is the same dude whos been featured here a few times before he posted under and ugiantflyingsheep the writing style and stories are very similar and i know hes a teacher and this username also has the number in it so he still hates women but now hes tried to get help and has rejected it awesome
SubredditDrama,removed,it is gamergate all over again buncha nerds getting pissy over something will never even remember what the issue is let alone manage to dredge up some caring over going on for weeks and months on end
SubredditDrama,removed,its not my fault people dont like some of my opinions
SubredditDrama,removed,bad is subjective tbh i think my opinions are very good sometimes people like my opinions here but true brilliance often goes unrecognized or is met with scorn
SubredditDrama,removed,stop calling me that im just looking to contribute to discussions and make good conversation like anyone else i dont see how you can call me a troll just because i get downvoted occasionally i get upvoted too in this case specifically i thought it was interesting that while other forms of discrimination such as sexism and homophobia seem to be trending down on reddit ableism appears to be on the rise the reciprocal juxtaposition is something worth exploring imo but if people dont want to that is fine also
SubredditDrama,removed,no im not ive been nothing but forthcoming to you and given the subject matter we are discussing that has been difficult youre the one whose acting childish and name calling black face is inappropriate in every instance because of the connotations and racism associated with it just because some good came from it doesnt mean it was wrong and bigoted to do in the first place no one would get away with black face in as they shouldnt brining up an example in the deep south during the doesnt apply to todays standards of behavior either way it just sounds like a publicity stunt to make money the civil rights movement wouldve been fine without some white guy wearing black face why are you trying to justify black face
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont understand if you agree with me in this instance why are you slandering me with false allegations in order to discredit my reputation i never heard of the user youre talking about if you found a watch on the beach it would probably be in poor condition due to high concentrations of salt in the air although it would depend on how long it was there
SubredditDrama,removed,wheres usovcitbot when you need him
SubredditDrama,removed,why would i make a new account to express the same opinions these are my opinions i am not a troll im beginning to think youre the troll who accuses ordinary redditors of being trolls to fluster them i will not be subject to this conspiracy against me silence
SubredditDrama,removed,no people who dont do anything wrong shouldnt be subject to discrimination
SubredditDrama,removed,you should reconsider that stance tbh a life filled with hate leads to a hatefilled life
SubredditDrama,removed,whats wrong with pepsi
SubredditDrama,removed,this sounds like conjecture i dont think theres anything wrong with pepsi
SubredditDrama,removed,oh no if its a joke within the sensitivity range of white boys its literally genocide
SubredditDrama,removed,otherwise you get the devil all up in your soft drinks i required proof to accept this as fact
SubredditDrama,removed,you just discredited yourself as a propagator of beverage conspiracies as soon as i relay this information to the top brass i will be vindicated ty
SubredditDrama,removed,well yeah the ones that are functional members of society arent the ones whining about ghostbusters going out on a limb here
SubredditDrama,removed,so your argument is that in some instances black face can be a good thing for the world or result in good consequences i am speechless i didnt think this level of ignorance was possible even on reddit but congratulations you exceeded my wildest expectations i feel sorry for you
SubredditDrama,removed,bigoted means dont justify the ends there are other ways to raise awareness than disrespecting the very people that you purport you are helping
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess worrying about getting gunned down by criminals was a figment of my imagination growing up cops were the only thing keeping animals in check
SubredditDrama,removed,what did i get wrong i grew up surrounded by black people and the cops were the only thing keeping it from looking like the wild west between the color coded animals that thought they were scarface but could barely read or write or shoot straight those are the ones killing kids in school yards because of missed shots over respect but ghostbusters lol
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah problem what do you call gangbangers fine upstanding human beings sorry if i hurt the feelings of any criminal here by recollecting the violent crime that surrounded most of my life feel free to get offended on behalf of people that rob assault murder and rape innocent people and leave entire neighborhoods in terror i had to be scared to even go out in front of my own house
SubredditDrama,removed,way to stereotype gang members as only black people you were the one that talked about groups of people so individual cases prove your stereotypes wrong do you enjoy erasure i never said anything negative about black people i dont like to be racist by lumping people into groups i prefer a classless society that is filled with equals
SubredditDrama,removed,so where is the racism i am for criticizing people that drop out of high school to get into drug game how is it racist are you under the impression that crossfire killing of innocent people does not happen if you grew up poor in ghettos maybe you would be more aware skin color doesnt grant you money or bullet proof skin
SubredditDrama,removed,reddits foremost misogyny subreddit no thats rall
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry for that burn on you
SubredditDrama,removed,im not a fisherman
SubredditDrama,removed,brings new meaning to the phrase impotent rage doesnt it
SubredditDrama,removed,were in a thread dedicated to making fun of me about my ex and youre pulling the pity card wiht me
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah the fact that any attractive woman automatically garners tons of sexual comments is gross dont get me started on how on many subs saying that youre a girl is like a signal for a thousand creeps to swarm your comment history to check for nudes and then reply to your comment telling everyone else whether theres nudes but the person doing the callout is doing it in the worst way possible and just giving the idiot antifeminists more ammo
SubredditDrama,removed,you are a very charming man i bet you have girls lining up to date you
SubredditDrama,removed,i was complimenting you what woman doesnt love a man who responds to mixed feelings with you care about complaining the charm is undeniable
SubredditDrama,removed,he dindu nuffin
SubredditDrama,removed,latest update httpsyoutubespbegmnpe
SubredditDrama,removed,oh boy time to report some popcorn pissers heres one
SubredditDrama,removed,i love that this is the only post youve made itt a touch salty one of your ideological compadres went off the deep end
SubredditDrama,removed,surprisingly he is less sympathetic to black people sitting down during the pledge
SubredditDrama,removed,if they actually are friends and the pornstar was genuinely apologetic forcing your so to cut off all ties with her seems harsh and unreasonable
SubredditDrama,removed,dont lie you cuck
SubredditDrama,removed,til how conservative reddit is is really good neckbeardreddit always amazes me funny enough the fact that a literal child on the internet being insulted by a weird dude who gets tons of support and money thrown at him for it purely because she chose to express herself in a style that didnt please him is a solid weight on the side of maybe feminism is still pretty important
SubredditDrama,removed,ill let u cuck me only if youre a hot chick or a hot pre op tranny
SubredditDrama,removed,then whats the jewish arabic in your flair you fucking towel head
SubredditDrama,removed,my god what is with this comments its like twox has become a place for shitty men to mansplain their shitty opinions rather than a place for women to discuss womens perspectives does anyone else agree
SubredditDrama,removed,i love it when reddit reactionaries get salty when called out on their shit lol keep at it mr dudebro
SubredditDrama,removed,came here to say this this reddit defaults are filled with racism missoginny hate and worse its like the men on reddit cant just leave one corner of the site dedicated for women to actually let women speak instead they have to mansplain their shitty perspectives and their what about teh menz tired posts its ugh i cant even this site anymore
SubredditDrama,removed,clearly were all just five minutes away from the nearest catholic marxist brown person murdering our entire family after buying an illegal gun using their government welfare cheque
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont identify as a feminist because i dont give a shit either way and i dont give a shit partly because of some negative experiences with feminists on and off the internet its not my fault uimtimewaste reached such a ridiculous conclusion about me and made some dumbass comparisons
SubredditDrama,removed,umaxiw if you can see this i have not once nor will i ever defend nazis our genocide or atrocities of any kind in any form the nazis were one of if not the cruelest organizations in history millions of completely innocent people were massacred and tortured in cold blood i shudder to even think of what these people had to go through that being said please pretty please stop thinking that those who think deportations of germans from eastern regions believes the nazis should not have been punished what im arguing here is that not everyone from the deported regions were nazis nor supported nazis you can disagree with this and i respect that but please at least try to see what im actually trying to say im sorry if youve met one too many nazi apologists in your life and it can get tiring cleaning up all the shit on the sub being a mod is a tireless job that being said i am not a nazi sympathizer i dont idolize nor have any connection to german anything im not a wehraboo im not a white supremacists nor even white and i have never said the nazis shouldnt not be punished to the maximum extent of the law all i said is that not all those who were punished were nazis and that group punishment is not right no offense but as a mod you especially banned me for taking a side you didnt agree with or misunderstood and then unceremoniously banned me in a very unprofessional way
SubredditDrama,removed,hello there youre one of my favourite polandball submitters and thus i am turning to you with a small sliver of hope that i can get unbanned from one of my most visited internet communities dont worry ill keep it short and without making an argument of my own i want you to tell me and be honest if you truly think anything i said was racist ill let you be the judge
SubredditDrama,removed,all gamers must die
SubredditDrama,removed,oh gee the ex mod of kia is here i cant possibly imagine whose side he is on
SubredditDrama,removed,shhhhh we have to pretend that they made a sexist slight against women it is the srd way
SubredditDrama,removed,kia is a hate sub is on opinion based on how far left or right you are and your personal viewpoints and experiences the article says gg started as a mysoginist harassment group talk about exaggeration to say that kia is anything like gg is ridiculous half of what they post is just shit they scrape off of twitter or something and shitpost about it in the comments theyre not gg theyre the slime that lategg left behind tbh this sub just reeks of shit stirring
SubredditDrama,removed,media outlets dont get to make death threats they make hitpieces attacking someone which is then viewed by thousands and potentially millions of people and youre forgetting that avgn undoubtedly did get death threats im going to pretend you didnt say that bit about him not being objective journalist because thats one of the most stupid things ive heard all week are you saying its impossible to form an opinion on a movie based on its promotional material honestly i dont get how you people can be this stupid if anyone wanted to actually kill anita sarkeesian or zoe quinn they wouldnt be sending them death threats theyd just do it how many death threats do you reckon theyve been sent how many times have they been killed
SubredditDrama,removed,wtf when a company makes a game they make a platform for people to be creative and make their world if someone doesnt want black people in their game then they have a fundamental right to not have them this is a blatant violation of the first amendment i hope theyre ashamed of themselves they make historical games they should know that this is just the first step along the line to fascism and the rise of hitler
SubredditDrama,removed,can we get a mod to remove white people from reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,haha httpswwwredditcomuserlithovore
SubredditDrama,removed,must be nice to be so privileged that you can get outraged at a video game you dont even play stay pedo nydbergs
SubredditDrama,removed,its not to dehumanize its an expression and its sadly fact of muslims in england france germany claim welfare payments they also have large famalies sometimes kids and some have polygamist marragies that is one muslim man can have many wives when they get into france england sweden germany they often bring over an extended family to visit that is aunts cousins uncles etc brussels the top seven baby boys names recently were mohamed adam rayan ayoub mehdi amine and hamza turks and pakistani in england and germany are having large families mohammed is most popular boys name in four biggest dutch cities and if trends continue britain to be biggest islamist country in europe by you dont need to look the the election of londonistans islamic mayor to see demographics are rapidly chaning in parts of europe and in cities like dearborn usa
SubredditDrama,removed,you ever notice that gamer gators think the only reason anyone does anything is because of threats and pressure the developers didnt take down the mod because it was the right thing to do in their minds but because they were bowing down to the fearsome sjws
SubredditDrama,removed,maaaannn its too bad this was removed for actually being specifically racist i thought i could get i to a srd censorship flamewar trifecta reddit admins take note the mod wasnt quarantined until the smoking gun was discovered this game has way better policies than this site
SubredditDrama,removed,lol go play in traffic
SubredditDrama,removed,its gonna be pretty difficult to enjoy any rock music from its golden era if you refuse to listen to artists who are assholes in their personal lives theres something a bit racist about reducing hip hop to grunting and being below other forms of music reminds me of how my racist as fuck grandparents talked about jazz being noisy garbage for potsmoking thugs
SubredditDrama,removed,islam sucks christianity sucks cant all these damned religions just go away endless void of nothingness
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah its gross that muhammad married a teenager but i really dont get why redditors harp on that but let every other historical figure who married a teenager slide especially on reddit this place is chock full of actual men who only think girls from are good enough to fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,religion of any kind is for drooling retards anyway to be honest
SubredditDrama,removed,considering how many redditors always rush to point out in any conversation that being attracted tohaving sex withmarrying a teenager isnt pedophilia because ackchyually its ephebophilia which is totally different than pedophilia and is only considered creepy and gross by uptight uncool prudes youd think that would be the one aspect theyre cool with
SubredditDrama,removed,people have a right to privacy and having their personal lives respected except for muslims so that we can accuse them of being notrue scotsmen whenever a terrorist attack happen
SubredditDrama,removed,downvote my comment for some popcorn
SubredditDrama,removed,month old account that posts nothing but muh white genocide and of course look at the statistics that stormfront just keeps rolling in huh
SubredditDrama,removed,this is your mind on identity politics everyone appropriates everyone
SubredditDrama,removed,men just need to learn their place
SubredditDrama,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,removed,he wasnt blaming the driver in the story he was just pointing out that you should still look just incase someone is doing dumb shit exactly just like i tell a rape victims you should be careful of what you wear the neighborhoods you go to and how much you drink im not blaming the victim im just pointing out some good advice
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont see how thats unbelievable then why bring up the trans men it had nothing to do with this except make you look stupid i guess i consider a privilege something that is advantageous because youre considered better than rather than lesser than but i may rethink my definition and open some discussions about this in my social justice circles have a good day if you want some things women are considered better at see empathy childcare and
SubredditDrama,removed,i must wonder that the lack of parades on imd might have to do with strong opposition to such events among progressive circles

SubredditDrama,removed,i was permanently banned from rlegaladvice within minutes after very obviously trolling in a single thread in which the op asked a very stupid question after having contributed there in a serious and helpful way on a number of occasions in isolation my ban was fair enough and i cant really bitch but by conduct was extremely mild compared to the crap that quality contributor uzapopa shitposts on a daily basis oh and it was the height of irony and hypocrisy that uramady locked the thread and stated that people who cant keep it civil arent welcome while he sanctions this zapopa idiocy

SubredditDrama,removed,the best part of will be seeing the collapse of rorangeputinlovers when their sentient cheeto loses the election theyre actually so insecure and reactionary that it will cause drama for months
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit dont nuance people in the real world can sometimes but not reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,a safe space is one that allows no contrary opinions thats reddit definition
SubredditDrama,removed,rdrama and srdd inevitably turned into tia with the whole white males are oppressed circlejerk who would have thought
SubredditDrama,removed,they like agenda posting as long as it falls in line with the whole woe is me white male oppressed by sjw bullshit
SubredditDrama,removed,downvoting contributions directly related to the discussion at hand is in flagrant violation of reddiquette
SubredditDrama,removed,shut up pussy bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,man i cannot enjoy south park anymore is it just me or was the series always so above everything and thinking that not caring and laughing at both sides equally was superior over taking a stance its so reddit to like them antiracists are as bad as the nazis they oppose because they defend themselves or inconvenience people with protests even being passionate instead of studiously unconcerned with anything but being unconcerned is seen as too much httpimgurcomkcrog feels like he should be a regular on the show or maybe im piecing together too few southpark pieces collected over the last few years into the wrong picture
SubredditDrama,removed,lol you of course as usual missed the nuance first time reading
SubredditDrama,removed,mods gods and us peons cant argue against them i cant say that im surprised to see pushing his south park neutrality onto this comment thread
SubredditDrama,removed,haha i dont resort to name calling unironically you shit gibbon
SubredditDrama,removed,because its pointless and a waste of time says the guy on reddit like i said it shows a certain level of acceptance of their crank nonsense fightingarguing against something means you accept it what kind of bullshit is this ignoringputting up with something is de facto acceptance in the words of dr king youve got this shit toootally twisted
SubredditDrama,removed,engaging with racists in a debate about racism puts that argument in the category of reasonable enough to be discussed problem is it should be in the immediately discarded because holy shit why even category this is the same stupidity that let trump dictate the narrative and become the republican nominee you confront and debunk period anything else is the same form of cowardice that racist demagogues thrive on bordering on appeasement
SubredditDrama,removed,theres no rule in the sidebar against taking lil bitchbois to task
SubredditDrama,removed,admins are looking into anyone brigading except rthedonald of course
SubredditDrama,removed,admins are looking into anyone brigading so dont oh so they are gonna look into td history of brigading threats posting addresses of transgender people and running in and up voting as many threats as they can find
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe get off the internet once in awhile neckbeard
SubredditDrama,removed,im a bot bleep bloop
SubredditDrama,removed,i admit i do lean heavily on that definition in order to provoke a reaction from people unfortunately its necessary you need to get them offscript before theyll even consider that things that are unambiguously racist are in fact racist and to do that you have to do something they dont expect
SubredditDrama,removed,youre getting too hang up on semantics and wordplay yes im shitposting because its fun to make fun of you sorry if that wasnt obvious but youre not too attentive
SubredditDrama,removed,is srd not fair and balanced enough for you
SubredditDrama,removed,hey thats my weather drama its hot as balls in this city i couldnt imagine being in a suit the way she was i got light headed during bottomless brunch after one mimosa and we had to move inside its flat out oppressive im sure ill sound like a jaded new yorker but someone cant possibly compare their weather in some podunk town to manhattan its like living in an oven except id perfer the over for a chance at dry heat
SubredditDrama,removed,but its the wrong fantasy series
SubredditDrama,removed,im sorry we dont like the cheeto benito here ill make sure were more supportive of fascism in the future
SubredditDrama,removed,toxic masculinity and an echo chamber culture id guess
SubredditDrama,removed,no one is trolling and i refuse to engage trumpalinas with my regular account which due to the nature of my job can be tied to me easily
SubredditDrama,removed,hey guys what about srs though
SubredditDrama,removed,the antitrump bias is well supported by reality i dont know what you expect unbiased to look like
SubredditDrama,removed,most of the promblems that the users in rshort complain about are super fucking stupid though like ive seen them unironically refer to anyone mostly women thats mean to short people as shortperson racist lmao what im short myself and its not a huge deal rshort is just full of entilited little manbabies
SubredditDrama,removed,i reject guys for being short and i know im not alone not only not alone im absolutely certain that im in the majority i dont know how it is in other countries but where im from dating a short guy or worse a guy shorter than you is a big nono
SubredditDrama,removed,of all the forever alone guys i know only one isnt a manlet and he has a serious bo problem
SubredditDrama,removed,short guys are the saddest creatures i know i have never met a short guy who wasnt a bitter asshole its sad because you know they arent going to find anyone who finds them attractive and will depend on pity fucks but on the other hand they are misogynistic assholes
SubredditDrama,removed,being a tall man is like being a woman with great breasts its sought after and considered attractive but not having that trait doesnt exclude anyone from the dating pool not being tall is ok being short isnt so no its not like breastsize ive never heard of men rejecting a woman just because shes flatchested not if she had other redeeming qualities i have known women myself included who have rejected guys just because they are short even if they had many redeeming qualities so you have to play the hand you were dealt id prefer they didnt play it at all honestly they often become much more bitter and misogynistic when they realize they cannot win anything with it after playing a lot ive known short guys who were oozing confidence who could land the hottest girls at a party or club or whatever other social event they might be at ive met several of those overconfident guys myself we all do we all make fun of them after for how they overcompensate and the girls who have a ons with them only do that a ons i havent met anyone on a ltr with a short guy they often find that the shame of being seen with one and the disrespect other people shown towards him are too much to handle or they just dislike their personalities because they see the disonance between a guy who is that short and a guy who has that much confidence it looks fake
SubredditDrama,removed,lol totally i enjoy my height privilege to oppress those pesky manlets xd
SubredditDrama,removed,more pedophile excusing behavior from reddit

SubredditDrama,removed,hes correctyou look like a fool
SubredditDrama,removed,only reactionaries amd idiots use slimgur
SubredditDrama,removed,sips water you dont have to be a joyless prude to note that the sexual drive really can be a powerfully delusive and morally stunting force that needs to be put under at least some control in a properly civilized society people on this site were raised by our sick culture to buy into a nihilistic liberal freeforall that endorses any pleasureseeking hedonic activity as good and denies that there can be any such thing as a sexual morality beyond maybe consent and then the men were raised to understand sexual conquest of women as something that literally defines their worth as human beings so much for consent i guess the result is the broken pathetic misery and degenerate savage evil you see all across redditcom when it comes to sexuality pornography everywhere masturbation addiction redpillism apologia for pedos so on so on maybe we should get over our reflexive rejection of any criticism of sexual expression and take what the conservatives and the radical feminists have to say more seriously
SubredditDrama,removed,if uagentlame is right then we better shut down reddit its hosted more cp than slimgur
SubredditDrama,removed,i cant help but get into an argument with them every damn time too
SubredditDrama,removed,if you stopped editing your comments and acting like a cunt tsk tsk its like we cant even have one discussion on reddit without someone being a womanhater

SubredditDrama,removed,blocking innocent people from trying to go to the university they are paying for is never justified people that selfish deserve to be shot
SubredditDrama,removed,remember uncensored news isnt racist
SubredditDrama,removed,its an unwritten rule of reddit any place that touts itself as the last bastion of free speech or someting similar is almost always a hive of racism and other shit
SubredditDrama,removed,i personally draw the line when you start inconveniencing people solely because of their race oh sweet tell me more about how you disliked mlks tactics

SubredditDrama,removed,why should tumblr facebook other social media sites be allowed subreddits but not us its so hypocritical
SubredditDrama,removed,oh srd agrees with the sjw circlejerk who could have guessed such a thing
SubredditDrama,removed,but the antiracists believe that if youre anything but white youre a marginalized untouchable class el oh el who let all the trumpets in here ill stop calling you a white man you stop calling me a black man and how about we just call each other americans yeah lets stop talking about race and itll go away cant handle all this winning
SubredditDrama,removed,its always annoying when people get it in their heads that they can somehow reinvent what words means to help them with a point they want to make like when people say sex and gender mean different things
SubredditDrama,removed,calling all white people racist is a racist remark you are judging people negatively based on their skin color
SubredditDrama,removed,god damn trumpets cant even meme properly now whats happening to this country
SubredditDrama,removed,its as much cultural appropriation as anything the blacks complain about

SubredditDrama,removed,but you cant expect straight white guys to be able to relate to movies with black middle eastern asian women or gay characters all the minorities should just shut up and watch the movies with straight white guys as the main characters instead of whining that they want to see themselves represented in movies s

SubredditDrama,removed,hes not unknown to me his name was but someone already explained who he is without being a smug asshole like you
SubredditDrama,removed,now i know what the term sjw originally meant describing an overzealous usually white person who would go overboard in defending minoritywomens rights eg holding the door open for a woman is patronizing and literally rape but i never actually saw anyone use it in those terms usually someone is an sjw for saying things like i dont think video games should depict olds with dd breasts in a bikini or maybe screaming faggot in cod is not an acceptable practice most of the time i think of someone who uses the acronym sjw unironically the same way as i think of the person who talks about cucks or cultural marxism
SubredditDrama,removed,when did i say i was a victim i said you argument was based on ad hominem which it eminently was i wouldnt suggest if i were and thus was clearly fallacious i didnt act offended once and actually clearly stated that this helped me by saying that it weakened your case if you think i was claiming to be victimised then you are just an idiot

SubredditDrama,removed,so you paid some company for the privilege of working a full time job hoping to find a digital artifact whos scarcity is arbitrary and if too many other people can have the same thing it actually ruins the experience of getting it for you youre either a narcissist or falling prey to some really skeezy casinolevel psychological manipulation
SubredditDrama,removed,if we do this do i get to rename td and altright
SubredditDrama,removed,thats what pretty much everyone thought about admins editing peoples comments spez could definitely change subreddit names if someone got him drunk and pissed him off enough probably unlikely but who knows
SubredditDrama,removed,ohh lets find out what radviceanimals thinks about rpolitics its an echo chamber for the far left on reddit closes tab
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont get why reddit feels the need to pretend all ideas need to be treated with the same merit and respect especially since these are the participation trophy guys rpolitics is a shithole but its better than rconservative which is just one literally year old mod posting factually incorrect facebook memes and banning everybody who doesnt like them when you compare it to thedonald it looks like an academic forum discredited scientific ideas like climate change isnt real and vaccines cause autism dont need to be treated with respect not to mention the extreme bigotry
SubredditDrama,removed,you know what is proconsumer though piracy
SubredditDrama,removed,i just went to their sub and recommended everyone to get an iphone so this should be fun

SubredditDrama,removed,i do that if i have a question i know is stupid i use an alt to ask it i can imagine him not wanting to tie his main account to such stupidity
SubredditDrama,removed,good arguments dont exist for supporting the rapey cheeto
SubredditDrama,removed,i sincerely hope that a similar mob of hateful cunts decides to one day arbitrarily cripple your ass if only because its much harder to spew this sort of paternalistic violentbigotryapologetic horseshit with a wired jaw
SubredditDrama,removed,youre forgetting that rape violates the nonaggression principal which totally works because in ancap land everyone is a rational actor
SubredditDrama,removed,since when can european citizens vote in an american presidential election

SubredditDrama,removed,mansplain you instantly became just as bad as those idiots stop talking
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont get why you people think its so outlandish that trump supporters would like a sub where they can show support without hearing idiotic tabloid headline drivel like orange hitler racist like you do in literally every other sub on reddit i dont think you can rag on rthedonald for being a safe space when all you need to do is go to any other sub ever to get your daily dose of trump hate stop being so fucking stupid please
SubredditDrama,removed,please never breed you sjw idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,ive sent an anonymous tip to the fbi including his username and screenshots of his post history hopefully they contact the reddit admins to get his ip track him down he needs to be institutionalizedlegitimately for at least a few weeks so he can get on proper medication
SubredditDrama,removed,rsubredditdrama on a thread full of atheists thats an interesting amount of people who dont understand the bible take your head out of your ass we understand your religious dictates we just reject them
SubredditDrama,removed,prove it

SubredditDrama,removed,dae regressive left
SubredditDrama,removed,just wondering who would adopt the language a of year old
SubredditDrama,removed,christ what is it with whiny men being completely incapable of accepting that women on average are subject to specific social oddities more often than they are the conversation is literally who says that as a woman i hear it all time er yea me too i also hear it all time who doesnt say it is what i meant
SubredditDrama,removed,go fuck yourself buddy ive still not forgiven you for that rbooks bullshit
SubredditDrama,removed,you are pretty good at pretending to be an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,you might want to brush up on your reading comprehension then again maybe youve reached the limits of your brain power at the time of her death mother teresa had opened missions welcoming the poor and sick in more than countries the missions have been described as homes for the dying by doctors visiting several of these establishments in calcutta twothirds of the people coming to these missions hoped to a find a doctor to treat them while the other third lay dying without receiving appropriate care the doctors observed a significant lack of hygiene even unfit conditions as well as a shortage of actual care inadequate food and no painkillers the problem is not a lack of money—the foundation created by mother teresa has raised hundreds of millions of dollars—but rather a particular conception of suffering and death there is something beautiful in seeing the poor accept their lot to suffer it like christs passion the world gains much from their suffering was her reply to criticism cites the journalist christopher hitchens nevertheless when mother teresa required palliative care she received it in a modern american hospital
SubredditDrama,removed,nigga please she was a cunt no go bend over so your local priest can fuck you in the ass catholicism is a cult
SubredditDrama,removed,suck my cock
SubredditDrama,removed,suicide ends the pain nothing else will
SubredditDrama,removed,however an internet vigilante group that is very visibly pursuing me hello the deep end i didnt think i would see you so early this morning
SubredditDrama,removed,guy is batshit crazy
SubredditDrama,removed,then take a look at this shitshow
SubredditDrama,removed,who fucking cares he raped an unconscious girl and ruined her life its only fair that he gets his life fucked up as return ugh i am so tired of redditors sympathizing with rapists
SubredditDrama,removed,where does he refuse to acknowledge that he is mentally ill and being mentally ill doesnt suddenly invalidate everything you say if he has hospital records or police reports which i didnt see that could show some of his story to be at least partially true or someone could be messing with him and taking advantage of his illness to make it seem like a vigilante group is after him and unhelpfully calling someone mentally ill can still be an insult if they mean it that way even if they are
SubredditDrama,removed,my thoughts exactly guy is in some kind of paranoid delusion poor guy
SubredditDrama,removed,you cant institutionalize somebody against their will unless theyre an immediate danger to themselves or others and unfortunately paranoia alone doesnt cut it its also possible that this person is living alone and their family doesnt know whats going on or doesnt know the full extent of the issue i would also hesitate to call somebody whos clearly suffering from a severe mental health issue a giant shit head he genuinely believes that the people hes speaking to are out to cause him harm
SubredditDrama,removed,its a lot worse than you guys realize here are some of his facebook trollings httpimgurcomaqejqv
SubredditDrama,removed,how do you explain that i am the founder of superfundresearchorg and that i am telling the truth and its all confirmed
SubredditDrama,removed,lol ive trained recklessly for years now you know what its done its made me stronger in what would otherwise be compromised position its made me physically more robust but keep on with the bitchmade attitude and thinking youre made of glass im sure thatll pay off when youre on your deathbed regaling your progeny with tales of your safe and functional fitness ya fuckin dullard
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont do crossfit dummy and pushing limits isnt a fad its fundamental part of strength trainingand training at large
SubredditDrama,removed,oh yeah how do you fix ugly hone structure or cystic acne scars postaccutain
SubredditDrama,removed,then how did i end up on the news in cleveland youre saying that the superfund project is a crazy theory im confused or maybe you just arent aware that there are superfund toxic waste sites in the us or that i run a reputable organization and its my job to educate people about it and othoname is destroying my campaigns all over the country source national priorities list epa website httpswwwepagovsuperfundnplsitetotalsstatusandmilestone have you considered the alternative that i might just be telling the truth
SubredditDrama,removed,we arent even allowed to call each other faggots any more
SubredditDrama,removed,but theyre being a dummy
SubredditDrama,removed,well considering i do not think i am being gang stalked and the email that was posted is not real but you arent the first person to call this gang stalking or that it resembles it my business partner works at facebook and even he sees it as if this person is trying to make it look like i am being gang stalked i assure though i do not think i am being stalked by the cia which is absurd because the cia is a foreign intelligence agency but of course there are tv news piece about me as well i posted more links to proof of who i am in this thread i am not being gang stalked im simply being targeted for being a whistleblower activist those are two different things
SubredditDrama,removed,the actual truth here is this person is harassing me and then if i say anything in response to get accused of harassing them even more and if i am telling the truth then image what this is doing to my life and career my very legitimate life and career if i am innocent then all of these accusations are nothing but defamation and further harassment
SubredditDrama,removed,ill try to feel bad an idiot on the internet doesnt agree with me
SubredditDrama,removed,this is really bad obvious abuse of power this adam henderson guy needs to be removed as mod of rseattle
SubredditDrama,removed,dammit this is what you get for founding so many subs
SubredditDrama,removed,aw did i trigger you by making a joke
SubredditDrama,removed,what a fucking meltdown this is all awesome by the way plus the dumbass loser who threatens to punch someone straight in the face what a bunch of redneck pieces of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,because its reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,his post history is full of things like that and the subreddit just added a user who made a post saying scary shit
SubredditDrama,removed,this is how rape culture gets perpetuated a bouncer or cop needs consent or its rape
SubredditDrama,removed,places like reddit reporting them as a possible threat so they are monitored and not allowing them to group up to further radicalize on their site would be a good start many times over you see incel regulars talk about how those subreddits made them more sure about their hate of women and normies those same users if you look at their history move from being upset about themselves to idolizing incel murderers they claim they want a place to be left alone and yet they abandoned rtruecels and moment it was quarantined they want to gather more people to radicalize
SubredditDrama,removed,i thought they would get the message when a httpsenmwikipediaorgwikijoshuarynegoldberg sadly even then they didnt bother to ban reuropean where he was trying to radicalize people and even let those mods take over runcensorednews he was also a mod of the valuable conversation spez protected in rcoontown since he modded the place when something eventually happens there isnt a defense for the reddit team anymore
SubredditDrama,removed,no context allowed got it
SubredditDrama,removed,the only solution is to have an objective nonbiased third party such as myself to suckle upon the teats of both women and whosoever has the creamiest finest tasting milk shall be awarded breast feeding rights we must put the childs needs first
SubredditDrama,removed,further evidence that any gathering of white males as large as raskmen will inevitably trend towards toxicity
SubredditDrama,removed,monsanto is probably evil in the sense that evil in terms of people and organizations who actively neglect the well being of other but thats irrelevent to the correctness of the science behind gmos
SubredditDrama,removed,but i just bought it form the bait show this morning
SubredditDrama,removed,you forgot the most important rule white males are toxicity personified
SubredditDrama,removed,ok ok my bad
SubredditDrama,removed,go back to tha liberry were u belonk
SubredditDrama,removed,i didnt know we had this many conservatards here youre really comparing smoking weed to theft
SubredditDrama,removed,you dont get to just make up pronunciations are you stupid thats literally how language works
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off these kinds of shit incentives are absolutely destroying academic science right now theres no extra innovation happening that wouldnt already be happening out of the passion and love scientists have for their research
SubredditDrama,removed,like seriously affirmative americans had gone though slavery and discrimination and racism whites are now being told to not be racist and its like the end of the world to them
SubredditDrama,removed,arent you a charmer
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,itt fatties are triggered
SubredditDrama,removed,as everyone knows any kind of slight against not white males is a trillion times worse than anything done to anyone thats white straight and male
SubredditDrama,removed,that implies a fat person can move fast enough to catch you
SubredditDrama,removed,um clearly you have no idea because many people lost weight because of that sub being fat is disgusting and shameful
SubredditDrama,removed,i see we have a lot of land whales in this thread
SubredditDrama,removed,the page wholesome memes being run by a racerealist a kind of white supremacist is entirely unsurprising honestly this is on facebook i dont know if the reddit version is run by the same people
SubredditDrama,removed,if telling the truth is always good why does reddit get offended when you call a white man racist
SubredditDrama,removed,not only does he reassure fans that their ignorant ideas are right and they are free to continue being closeminded but they can also use him to say nuh uh i dont hate them gays milo says its okay to refer to people as faggots and lgbt people are a monolith so he speaks for all of them
SubredditDrama,removed,ulamentationsoftheir do you have anything to add
SubredditDrama,removed,wrong the core of feminism is belief in patriarchy which is basically a conspiracy theory and yet rconspiracy isnt a feminist utopia yet
SubredditDrama,removed,no dude youre fine its just nonsense that defensive men have learned to shriek because everyone goes full retard whenever gendercultural issues come into play
SubredditDrama,removed,hows being fat going for you
SubredditDrama,removed,or yknow people who grew up with particular ideas about femininity and masculinity and enforce those ideas on their kids like im not even a woman and i remember my female relatives getting chided for sitting a certain way maybe just maybe you dont know what youre talking about this time
SubredditDrama,removed,is it really that much better that its actually about making sure women who work fewer hours than their male counterparts get paid just as well
SubredditDrama,removed,poor oxus surrounded by retards who think manspreading is real
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean moonphysics seemed to be more trying to parse out how the idea of manspreading might have stemmed from other more salient issues while ultimately concluding that it isnt a good idea because there are a hundred different reasons why someone might spread out on a subway and its impossible to conclude theyre doing it because they feel entitled to that space because of their gender but yeah i guess its easier to just mock and dismiss instead of engaging mras are all just sexless losers amirite
SubredditDrama,removed,except a very very large number of people do believe him thats the problem here listen and believe who are you to tell an oppressed person that their lived experiences arent real
SubredditDrama,removed,except that this person isnt being oppressed theyre being thrown off of an airplane for being a dick and you have the gall to blame them instead of the racist patriarchal cisdominant society that forced them to act like a dick seriously though effete progressives cant come out of the woodwork fast enough to emphasize with some underprivileged youth who gets a jail sentence for assaulting a dude and stealing his phone but apparently such empathy ends when someone does something a lot less violent for a little bit of internet fame
SubredditDrama,removed,what effete progressives siding with criminals to virtue signal nah
SubredditDrama,removed,kys
SubredditDrama,removed,whoa that is ableism and not okay
SubredditDrama,removed,w e a p o n i z e d a u t i s m e a p o n i z e d a u t i s m
SubredditDrama,removed,damndudes about to drop off like unidan well maybe not reddit will probably all back him up and congratulate him on sticking it to that girl when in actuality that was creepy and cringey as fuck like thats something an emotional teenager does
SubredditDrama,removed,this sub is just a bunch cucks congregating and jerking each other off with the same thought process youre a faggot the mods here are faggots and yeah im booty hurt every time i comment here even if its super vanilla yall get your collective panties in a massive bunch go die you faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,if anything the japanese are worst imo if the stories of my grandparents are true
SubredditDrama,removed,everyone likes to think of themselves as a housesherlocktype whose genius allows them to get away with being a total shithead towards other people and then naturally any of their shitty politicalsocial opinions are right because any opinion a whats the term term reddit likes stemlord yes because they are a genius engineermath acecomp sci wizard everything else they think will also be correct absolutely and forever
SubredditDrama,removed,please refer to my previous comment about your irritating allergy to logic you go right ahead and stick with your understanding im good with that like all the other irritating bs youve put out there what you believe is irrelevant to me take care now little ninja buddy
SubredditDrama,removed,i just reread your post and youre right that isnt what you said you were talking about making efforts to try to understand the reason for someone feeling that way my bad
SubredditDrama,removed,yikes didnt know he was such a moody asshole my distrust of women is the stuff of freaking legends tells me all i want to know about this guy shame i thought he was cool not another whiny entitled asshole on this site
SubredditDrama,removed,hahahahahahaha dudes are fucking gross
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit is hollywood heroes rise and fall at the drop of a fedora

SubredditDrama,removed,anyone got a link to his facebook
SubredditDrama,removed,ive got a pony on ufuckswithducks being the next one to fall
SubredditDrama,removed,no one cares that hes not delusional you fuckwit
SubredditDrama,removed,what kind of dumb ass fucking shit this why the fuck should anyone sacrifice themselves to save a bunch of people he doesnt know as if its required to do any and everything to save your fellow humans or that you have to even care about them people like you are the reason i would happily let those people die because most of them are probably like you
SubredditDrama,removed,uverifiedson
SubredditDrama,removed,but hes the only thing stopping ushittywatercolor from becoming president
SubredditDrama,removed,execpt were often moderators too so it ends up being hypocrticial id make a joke about upreggit at this point but its not called mod abuse monday for no reason
SubredditDrama,removed,so where do the ugly ones go then
SubredditDrama,removed,ive never liked uawildsketchappeared he always seemed to make his drawings unnecessarily vulgar and juvenile it doesnt surprise me that he would act in a vulgar and juvenile manner
SubredditDrama,removed,i pray to god this guy is being monitored by the police or some sort of authority or at the very least women know hes unstable i would not be that surprised if he ended up raping or killing a woman
SubredditDrama,removed,man i always thought uawildsketchappered was one of the good guys
SubredditDrama,removed,holy fucking shit fuck reddit fuck reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,the guy was either very obviously the scammer if you did a bit of sleuthing or just a straight up troll no business having his sorry ass on my front page itd definitely be a horrible clearly over the top response if the guy did get scammed but that wasnt the case
SubredditDrama,removed,httpsvidmecrjj
SubredditDrama,removed,hey joanwaynegacy thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because this paragraph kia gets wind of this egregious censorship and everyone ruffles their feathers at the thought of a post being removed and gets generally angry and what this has to do with video game ethics i havent the damnedest clue is pretty biased can you please edit that and ill reapprove it kthnxbai for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to

SubredditDrama,removed,aw way to hurt my feels bro
SubredditDrama,removed,its immature because its immature whatever nice circular logic op should probably still kill himself though hes a thief who slanders people and tries to get others on his side with some guilt tripping suicidethreatening bullshit not a good human being
SubredditDrama,removed,kill yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah fuck that stupid cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,pray ufuckswithducks never falls
SubredditDrama,removed,🤔 if op was my son id seriously regret giving it life hes an absolute waste of resources guy should definitely kill himself
SubredditDrama,removed,wow long time lurker first time caller the comments here are very disturbing to me i am the head department chair of neuro biology at a major midwestern prestigious college this guy in the comments he just wasnt interested in listening and learning which is the first thing you are taught its clear from the context that he is devaluing womans opinions in twox and refuses to listen to their experiences and talks right over them this is patriarchy theory ladies this shit has no place in medicine and our women our daughters and sisters and mothers will continue to die while medicine stands by and twiddled there thumbs
SubredditDrama,removed,but this is a false equivalence fallasy used to undermine the point we are trying to make the doc is a patriarchal figure that is mansplaining to us instead of listening and learning
SubredditDrama,removed,what if he actually is wrong hint im the head of medicine at a major midwestern university hint again that means im the department chair and heres the real bad news for you im a real gross evil woman i know how you hate them and im here to tell you he is a mansplaining arrogant little prick asshole im glad is giving him the what for
SubredditDrama,removed,no just no this is made up shit to lampoon a real damaging philosophy fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,came here to say this he comes across as ugly hes a shitbag and the funny thing is he really doesnt even know what hes talking about
SubredditDrama,removed,he needs correcting
SubredditDrama,removed,the doc really is clueless
SubredditDrama,removed,you are drawing a false equivalence fallasy
SubredditDrama,removed,came here to say this it was a great sub for women to talk about womens perspectives then it became a default and all the mansplainers twerpers mras ect ect ect invaded and it bcame an angry space for men to talk about what they hate about women
SubredditDrama,removed,when you really are the most awake most conscious person in the room i think that kind of gives you the right to be a bit rapey and sexually aggressive especially when youre fucking with a bunch of people who havent give the first sign of consent for the act youre about to engage in but are still acting like its nonconsensual
SubredditDrama,removed,on reddit no cant even go to raskfeminists or a similar place to even learn about it seriously try it rdemmian will ban you for so much as breathing incorrectly while typing a question
SubredditDrama,removed,oh fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,perfect phrase for a downright retarded statement like the primary victims of war are women
SubredditDrama,removed,see im not some pathetic loser who gets satisfaction out of putting people in their place that comment chains says otherwise
SubredditDrama,removed,as for shopping beetus no thats the one claim you deny namely the one i didnt even make i quote your goons photoshopped her into porn nothing denying calling middle easterners sand niers or threatening to rape cojocos daughters extracting revenge porn from impressionable kids or vowing to drive people to suicide and the myriad of other disgusting things youve done like beetus trying to spread rumors about me and my gf because she misunderstoof stuff would that be the same girlfriend that the cntwn moderator got you must be since youve only ever had one girlfriend your entire life he is trying to say i stalked beetus because i reposted stuff she posted elsewhere on reddit beetus went to the admins but they werent buying it the admins suck at dealing with abuse and beetus sucks at reporting this sort of thing to them you got away with it that doesnt mean that what you did was right remeber this is a gamergate dude he doesnt understand reality and isnt afraid to lie ask him what he thinks about trans people you dont believe that im a liar yourself or you wouldnt tell people to ask me what i think of transgenderism after all a liar would just lie about it right its pretty obvious antonio doesnt have a job because he is arguing all hours of the day its true that i lack your great career as a dish machine operator and your mad typing ability at around wpm maximum skills according to your resume after all i am on benefits due to my crippling disabilities thanks to productive people like your brother people like me dont have to starve anymore
SubredditDrama,removed,no its not maybe you should just say what you mean stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,thats because youre dumber than a sack of rocks which of course explains why youre incapable of taking statements at face value honestly though nothing less should be expected from the kind of piece of shit who participates in badphilosophy and badpsychiatry youre a worthless sack of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,feminists are stupid throw facts at them
SubredditDrama,removed,redditirl
SubredditDrama,removed,are you retarded
SubredditDrama,removed,youre going to great lengths to pretend this isnt racist or youre genuinely stupid
SubredditDrama,removed,looks like you are still having trouble oh well cant fix stupid i guess
SubredditDrama,removed,when explaining things to stupid people you try to break it down so they can understand obviously it doesnt always work as you have proven but you still try
SubredditDrama,removed,you have nothing else to say so you assume im a trump supporter and try to attack me for it bro youre dumb as shit sorry to be the one to tell you go back to rpolitics and renoughtrumpspam where your brand of stupidity is appreciated
SubredditDrama,removed,thats called gerontophilia
SubredditDrama,removed,what i did leave and i didnt pay her you fuckwad u didnt even read the fucking post i turned up she looked old and ugly i gave her cause i felt awkward not complaining about that it was my choice then i left
SubredditDrama,removed,just stop honestly hypothetical victims you should be ashamed of yourself youre attempt to justify the actions of a bunch of sociopathic individuals who fantasize about raping children is not only misguided but incredibly offense to every person whos been victimized go duck yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,why not date other trans people if cis people are all potential muderers why do you still feel entitled to date us
SubredditDrama,removed,no theyre not notoriously unreliable they are remarkably accurate actually there is no academic dispute about that and there never has been in real life only in ctrhrc land there was never even a whisper of a dispute about the accuracyt of exit polling until people got suspicious in this primary so the nyt helpfully stepped in to assist in quashing that controversy in an oh so rare example of the establishment press helping out the establishment candidate
SubredditDrama,removed,absolutely trans people are no more entitled to date cis people than cis people are to date trans people loud voices in the trans community push trans women to lie about or omit their gender transition to improve their ability to catch higher value straight cis men because god knows transchasers are universally despised by trans women but you know what many trans people outright refuse to date other trans people they feel entitled to cis peoples bodies to make themselves feel cis so they dont even want to date each other yet when cis people dont want to date trans dont want to be tricked or trapped dont want to be raped by deception they are the bad guys right
SubredditDrama,removed,i feel so bad for reddit admins getting pinged for shit like that and this because your comment probably pinged him too
SubredditDrama,removed,everyone has a right to be attracted to you can be attracted to children animals and cadavers and thats okay by me no such thing as a thoughtcrime start relationships with whomever they want what the fuck this is the entitlement i was talking about nobody is owed a relationship with anybody else period there needs to be mutual consent and that means there cant be deception about their gender i cant crossdress to date a lesbian woman i have a crush on i cant lie about my gender identity to date her either and if we end up having sex itd be rape by deception without threats of violence the other poster put that strawman argument in my mouth i never said anything about violence or threats of such i said trans women who lie about their transness to date cis men feel entitled to our time emotional investment and bodies i will not accept the but cis men are murderers rhetoric when the ealier poster was actually defending lying about her transness to get dates with said cis men how do you play the victim card when you instigate the very lies that cause the fucking problem in the first place either be honest early on or dont date us cis men youre so afraid of borderline hate speech if calling out the rapey what he doesnt know cant hurt him mentality moraly justified with the but my rape victim might murder me trump card spread throughout mtf forums is borderline hate speech then ill happily accept a lable of transphobe or whatnot just disregard all my earlier posts defending the scientific reality of transgender brains and helping young trans get in touch with resources to help them transition
SubredditDrama,removed,whats the difference here the context is that its immoral and by all means should be illegal to deceive somebody to believe in a false gender or genitals for the purpose of dating or having sex with them some people in this thread argue that their personal safety overrides their victims right not to be raped so my question to them is how about not dating deceiving and raping us cis guys you are so afraid of murdering you why do you trans women believe you have a right to deceive us for as damn long as you please because coming out is dangerous a danger that wouldnt be there in the first place if you werent deceiving its circular logic and doesnt address the real issue straight transwomen are often exclusively attracted to straight masculine cis men who top them and make them feel like a woman those men tend to be not into trans women so theres a lot of jealousy resentment and sour grapes and the cis guys who are actually into trans women tend to be undesireable chasers and bottoms fueling the dating angst and ultimately driving many trans wome to lie about being cis themselves to get a leg up on the competition lets look at what happened i said absolutely to him questioning my word choice of entitled entitled is absolutely thr right word to explain the mindset the violence stuff is his words not mine
SubredditDrama,removed,you sound triggered
SubredditDrama,removed,it justifies three years behind a prison cell thats what what it doesnt deserve is a bunch of progressives cheering on dare i say it the growing rape culture in the trans community and if trans women are encroaching on cis porn subs as the op srd post linked that demands at the very least a mtf tag out of respect to the sexualities of the viewers let the viewers know that they are looking at the breasts of a trans woman instead of doing everything under your control to hide it and trick people mostly cis straight men to masturbating to something they nevet consented to
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah im sure most are but this guy is bragging about taking straight men home and playing the crying game he gets off on it
SubredditDrama,removed,why not date other black people there are white people willing to date black people and vice versa just like there are cis people willing to date trans but youll call them chasers and detest them but in this analogy youre advocating black people to wear whiteface and bleach their skin and straight up lie about their race for their own safety so they can date racist whites and the key to this analogy rests on whether or not you believe race is a valid basis for sexual orientation and not just gender why not date straight men this one makes the least sense are you talking about lesbians of course lesbians should date other lesbians lesbians should not date straight women by binding their breasts dropping their voice wearing fake beards and lying about being a man but you seem okay with this as long as lesbian woman claims ftm identity after being caught and now the straight woman that was deceived and possibly violated is a transphobic bigot yay for justified rape concern trolling aka somebody seeing through the bullshit and calling for a halt on horrible immoral ideas like your believe that my sexual preferences as a straight cis man are to be derided and trampled on as long as you want to a relationship with me if i dont want to date trans women then too fucking bad for me because now trans women are entitled to keep their biological sex a secret and surprise me with a penis of their own after months of dating and bjs preop or surprise me with a total abscence of a womb after months of trying to conceive with my wife postop i as a cis man only want to date other cis women fuck me for not wanting a relationship or sex with a trans woman right fuck me for expecting honesty about gender and biological sex in a relationship right no just keep using the cis guys are potential murderers excuse to deceive to us yet still date us and rape us anyways you know goddamn well the real reason why mtf assume cisfemale identity to date straight cis guys its to expand your dating pool to trap cis guys who arent into mtfs into being in a relationship with you mtfs overwhelmingly hate chasers even though they are the only cis men who genuinely want a relationship with them no they want what they cant have the stereotypical masculine man the forbidden fruit is all the more alluring everything else is post hoc rationalization of this fact mockery the only valid arguments put forth are arguments against a strawman somebody else wrote youre not being intellectually honest and would rather debate somebody elses words put in my mouth rather than what ive said myself
SubredditDrama,removed,k
SubredditDrama,removed,cant be a woman with a dick bro
SubredditDrama,removed,a woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by men simultaneously
SubredditDrama,removed,a woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by men simultaneously
SubredditDrama,removed,obviously that just makes you a cuck according to them
SubredditDrama,removed,they should be tagged so people who want to fap to traps can do just that and people who dont want to fap to traps arent tricked into doing so if everybody was honest here there would be no conflicts of interest the trap in question claimed shes being discriminated against because there are straight guys that arent into her because she has a penis she also believes she has a right to conceil her biological sex in a pornographic setting to trick guys into masturbating to chicks with dicks i say no to both be honest or get out enough with the trickery and rape mindset
SubredditDrama,removed,no youre causing lasting damage thats actually proven raising the odds of suicide and generally pretending you know something about mental health while obviously suffering from issues of your own
SubredditDrama,removed,because you either didnt pay attention during the whole primary or dont know how to use google and i have nothing better to do than educate some random asshole whos speaking yet has no idea what hes talking about right
SubredditDrama,removed,ヽ༼ ຈل͜ຈ༽ ﾉ raise them dongers raised check out for more info
SubredditDrama,removed,why is it assholes like you refuse to type one simple sentence into google and act like you just scored a victory when someone refuses to do it for you am i your fucking babysitter your care provider how much of an idiot are you as much as you seem to be on reddit if so i hope youre getting the help you need
SubredditDrama,removed,dont be such a prick where did he say he was being censored uvioletrags just made a dig about how often they swear and say shit like that judging by the hate this guy is getting for this instance its fuckwits like you who read between nonexistant lines and end up creating this kind of shit in the first place
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe if they complied more often they wouldnt get shot they deserved it and youre wrong
SubredditDrama,removed,you called me an idiot bro httpstaticimagespublisherattncomsitesdefaultfilessouthparkjpg you have the reading comprehension level of a first grader mlk isnt talking about his tactics being to cause as much inconvenience as possible he says that white peoples inconvenience is not of his concerns because his struggle is more important mlk isnt saying go to movie theaters and talk really loud in your cellphone so eventually black people will be granted the same rights as white people i totally agree with mlk a lot of protest and direct action that i have myself taken part of has caused a great deal of inconvenience to my surrounding but the explicit purpose has never been to cause inconvenience thats just a by product do you see the difference between having the tactic to cause inconvenience and a tactic that happens to cause inconvenience
SubredditDrama,removed,lived in nyc most of my life one thing i can say uqueenfleury is completely right most people who are assholes arent from the city at all from what ive found real new yorkers arent assholes we just dont care sometimes that apathy comes off as being an asshole
SubredditDrama,removed,you cant fondle anything in virtual reality people also males can be sexually harassed too wtf lol ive had someone on onward hold their knife where their dick would be and stab me with it and they were on my team you would have to be looking down at your own fucking breasts to realize that you were being sexually harrassed w e w l a d e w l a d

SubredditDrama,removed,its always so funny to watch reddit react to something it likes when the majority of the general public dont like it the lack of perspective of how important a popular opinion is on reddit is just funny

SubredditDrama,removed,you dont really need to be a communist to be cynical about the free market

SubredditDrama,removed,why cants the soccers just pass the balls friendishly and score the baskets like good cricketeers
SubredditDrama,removed,we can do better late yesterday after an important game between liverpool fc and chelsea fc which finished creativepenguin posted a link to an article on rliverpoolfc about the liverpool goalscorer having a beer bottle thrown at him by one of the chelsea fans he that the mods of rsoccer had removed the article twice already and the users of rliverpoolfc respond with their traditional disdain of rsoccer and their mods shortly thereafter the article popped up again on rsoccer and creativepenguin speculated eventually rsoccer mod responded to the rsoccer thread claiming that then found creativepengiuns rliverpoolfc thread and replied with the following comment banning creativepengiun on rsoccer for their words on rliverpool the rliverpoolfc mods dont seem to have taken kindly to this and one moderator sylviek responded with a very nicely worded admonishment of actions as well as a request for how they proceed in future youll find that this is not the end after some hours presumably while everyone slept by calling out rliverpoolfc mods for not removing comments calling him a cunt but without referencing a single thing that sylviek had said what followed which youll see from the link above is a long conversation between and another rliverpoolfc mod plasticmouldsman where the latter tries to explain ad hominem attacks and echoes much of what sylviek said while trying to take the conversation to the modmail doubles down further while the conversation escalates and continues to criticise the rliverpoolfcc mods meanwhile on rsoccer things are getting worse for as his comments continue to spiral from as of this moment hasnt posted on rliverpoolfc in a while and is potentially banned although there is no proof of that this has potential for more drama if one of the top team sides has banned the mod of the larger soccer subreddit further to this is
SubredditDrama,removed,i consider myself genderfluid there is no such thing youre simply deranged
SubredditDrama,removed,mtf trans women are women no theyre not theyre men who think theyre women i was under the impression that transgender people try to argue gender rather than sex xx chromosome female xy chromosome male thats it end of story

SubredditDrama,removed,fash has been bashed
SubredditDrama,removed,shut it down
SubredditDrama,removed,ban the fash
SubredditDrama,removed,why they dindu nuffin they weh good white boys n sheit
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit has a culture all its own including a leftward political slant users who didnt have leftward views found their voices were not heard so formed new communities where their views dominated new users were attracted by these communities these new and old users began to disrupt the peaceful and largely homogenous culture of reddit reddit responds by loudly condemning them and in some cases banning them redditors see no irony in any of this
SubredditDrama,removed,i may not support your vision of ethnic cleansing but ill defend to the death the right to plan and organize it moderate reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,one of your fellow mods said the same thing lmao
SubredditDrama,removed,no
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck uspez
SubredditDrama,removed,while were at it why not spam rwhitebeauty with httpiimgurcomundefinedjpg
SubredditDrama,removed,if who we lose is td users like yourself then its a good thing
SubredditDrama,removed,we must never forget the six million men and women who were silenced when this subreddit was banned
SubredditDrama,removed,the liberals lost this election so now lets take away all of our subreddits that way it looks like we won
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,ever heard of webms cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,they were banned for doxxing and witch hunts
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean rfatlogic still exists and many viewers on that sub like myself miss rfatpeoplehate being fat is a lifestyle choice that lazy degenerates make
SubredditDrama,removed,add this too if you want
SubredditDrama,removed,i kinda assume im on the list ive been systematically harassed by them before and also ive been a strong antidonald since plus i was the only guy in that rnews thread saying it was a alt right guy who shot up that mosque so they brigaded me telling me to stop spreading false information yeah im on the list good thing i change around personal info in my stories and i have a gun
SubredditDrama,removed,this is getting juicy they are blaming rthedonald for getting them banned
SubredditDrama,removed,whoever banned it is a filthy kike
SubredditDrama,removed,you shouldnt be welcome on a site that brands itself as a site welcoming to all people but every liberal forum that wishes violence upon trump supporters are ok
SubredditDrama,removed,move back to the uk then illegal white
SubredditDrama,removed,no i just view those subs as motivation to stay fit and not become a whale
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,has a link to it
SubredditDrama,removed,so advocating for the self preservation and determination of your people is nasty
SubredditDrama,removed,the only genocide that is happening is white genocide mass migration in eu
SubredditDrama,removed,i cant wait until liberals are able to discuss race and genetics without calling it akin to genocide
SubredditDrama,removed,the only genocide that is happening is white genocide mass migration in eu when the left say genocide it is doublespeak
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont see the difference
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean those nazis are at least coherent in their political idealogy in that all nonwhite people are subhuman td is just a loose amalgamation of racists edgy teens trolls and all purpose idiots united against some nebulous evil establishment they hate so much
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah hitler was the most evil man to ever live my teacher taught me that hillary is a shoe in drumpf is delusional my teacher taught me that
SubredditDrama,removed,wesearchr dotcom
SubredditDrama,removed,opposing views hurt me
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you spez
SubredditDrama,removed,no were not you get banned for showing people studies that iq is genetic and there are inherent differences between racial populations and that this was the explanbation for racial differences thats a forbidden idea but it explains everything it explains why after decades of spending we havent closed the education gap at all it explains crime rates it explains poverty it invalidates the liberal point of view thats why it is banned
SubredditDrama,removed,if you arent a science denier then do you acknowledge the physical differences between the races such as skull structure skeletal structure brain size and melanin levels and the differences in intelligence quotient test performance the physical differences alone prove that the races have evolved separately from one another and when you combine that data with the consistent differences in iq test performance and school standardized test performance throughout every country it becomes clear that the races do not perform the same physically or mentally if the environment is the causing factor for the different scores and performance then why is the data and results persistent through every country why is it that in every country the data is always consistent where eastasians score higher than whites and whites score higher than africans why is it that when income and the environment is the same for the different groups the gaps still exist while there is an environmental factor it is primarily because collectively races do not perform the same physically or mentally due to biological evolution jewishamerican average intelligence quotient level asianamerican whiteamerican hispanicamerican blackamerican subsaharan african australian aboriginal httpjohnhawksnetexplainerlaboratoryracecranium
SubredditDrama,removed,youre next buddy
SubredditDrama,removed,httpsredditcomralternativerightwing here i made ya all a sub non rule breaking and no doxxing
SubredditDrama,removed,were talking about the altright being banned not the holocaust
SubredditDrama,removed,first they came for the blacks and i didnt speak out because i wasnt black and then they came for the jews and i didnt speak out because i wasnt a jew and then they realized that all the problems had been pretty much been solved so they stopped coming for people albert einstein
SubredditDrama,removed,might want to keep runcensorednews away from mosques the left and their kind are weak individuals once they feel the full force of people who honestly dont give a fuck and who wont bat an eye when crushing them theyll run for the hills so the next time anyone whos conservative talks about moderation remember that you dont need to pander to faggots degenerates feelings different genders etc to win you just go and take what you want and never apologise for anything and to get the point across that we allow these maggots to exist only for as long as we feel like it well ban any fucker that in this thread takes a leftist or liberal stand just because we can and because we dont give a fuck about your opinion
SubredditDrama,removed,first they came for the blacks and i didnt speak out because i wasnt black and then they came for the jews and i didnt speak out because i wasnt a jew and then they realized that all the problems had been pretty much been solved so they stopped coming for people albert einstein
SubredditDrama,removed,pizzagate isnt real retard
SubredditDrama,removed,first they came for the blacks and i didnt speak out because i wasnt black and then they came for the jews and i didnt speak out because i wasnt a jew and then they realized that all the problems had been pretty much been solved so they stopped coming for people albert einstein
SubredditDrama,removed,now we just need to get rid of rthedumbfuckistanis
SubredditDrama,removed,no its doesnt
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry if you are triggered by the truth
SubredditDrama,removed,shareblue pouring million dollars in to reddit to astroturf for the liberals its a merger between ctr and another liberal propaganda mill youre being indoctrinated reddit youre supposed to be smarter than to fall for this bullshit learn to think for yourselves analyze the facts for yourselves if youre dependent on others to tell you what you should think of a situation youre ripe to be controlled funny how the republican subs are being shut down
SubredditDrama,removed,i for one am disappointed banning people from a forum which advocates free speech is a pretty poor approach our grandparents used tanks to get rid of nazis i think we need to get on their level not this half assed crap
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck off racist
SubredditDrama,removed,why are far left wackos from rpolitics allowed to make death threats against president trump every day when is that shit sub going to be banned
SubredditDrama,removed,your high school really needs some new text books
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe for you
SubredditDrama,removed,youre nothing but a thug
SubredditDrama,removed,im fine with ignoring reddit for a week while you throw your fits and then leave
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah and hey know this is simply a strategy reddit is using to try to bring down the don fuck this website and their admins
SubredditDrama,removed,lol nice gaslighting attempt broseph stalin
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks it means global struggle well drag you across the finish line to final victory my friend whether you want it or not youll thank us later
SubredditDrama,removed,also id love to shoot a td for breaking into my home
SubredditDrama,removed,that is all the libs have left its a form of cowardice and desperation mr pai at the fcc will be looking at the obvious lib bias in all social media with the daily death threats against the president on rpolitics i would not be surprised if the us government took action we will see how the libs like censorship then
SubredditDrama,removed,it happened with germans after wwii million were expelled some died in transit but history is written by the victor so who cares
SubredditDrama,removed,if thats the case then its a brilliant plan lets hope it works out
SubredditDrama,removed,im all for hearing peoples points of view so i can block them and not hear their points of view especially when those people are neonazis go suck an egg whiner
SubredditDrama,removed,atleast im not an uncivilized thug ruining western civilization
SubredditDrama,removed,hey at least i didnt support a fascist for potus so at least ive got that going for me
SubredditDrama,removed,you are and you deserve it donald supporters are ignorant scum of the earth you are whats keeping america from progressing
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry confederate loser its been years move the fuck on you cant own people anymore
SubredditDrama,removed,if only the crusades kept going
SubredditDrama,removed,bye nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,oy vey shut it down
SubredditDrama,removed,you realize white isnt an ethnicity right
SubredditDrama,removed,nazis arent people which is why violence towards them is ok
SubredditDrama,removed,i posted on the sub and im neither for national socialism nor communism but for people saying it should have been banned because it was full of nazis and since its a dangerous ideology that we shouldnt tolerate which is a strong argument whats the rationale for not applying the same standards to communist subs
SubredditDrama,removed,hurr altright nadzees id call you an uninformed faggot but you serve my purposes better by continuing to be a cancerous moron please carry on
SubredditDrama,removed,nazis are horrible people that advocated genocide fuck them allows for communism subs to thrive
SubredditDrama,removed,just discovering wesearchr and damn i would have just used it to find rare porn but these wingnuts are using it to get back at people protesters politicians and all sorts of other targets of the extreme right
SubredditDrama,removed,leftists isnt it tds insult of choice
SubredditDrama,removed,youre just a homophobic sexist
SubredditDrama,removed,same goes for you
SubredditDrama,removed,i posted there if my posts were still in my history i dont think youd find one post about jews if not telling dailystormers to fuck off and tone it down that said i dont think theres anything inherently evil or bigoted in being intrigued by the singular history of jews their relationship with different host countries and what prompted these to turn against them so many times or in pointing out the power held by them in the west and criticizing israel if you think there is id really unironically love to hear why
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,👌👈 👆
SubredditDrama,removed,fuckem the only good nazi is a dead nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit admins banned ramazondeals for posting affiliate links but allow httpsnpslickdealscom ceo to do an ama which is easily worth of thousands of dollars of promotion not to mention thousands of new customers all for free and lastly their affiliate links are all over reddit and nobody at all has a problem with that so they are even profiting big time to further of slickdeals social traffic is from reddit httpsnpredditcomsimilarwebcomwebsiteslickdealsnetsocial all over reddit are subs dedicated to only individual with the intention of promoting themselves and their goods usually of the sexual naturethere are tons of them is reddit turning into fasion mayhem where everyone has their own sub not to mention that companies wanting to sell their goods directly to redditors go on httpsnpredditcomrfrugalmalefashion to do so and even get nice flairs to accompany their usually company oriented usernames that say things like official company account httpsnpredditcomramazondeals was subscribers strong and growing who loved that sub and saved tons of moneyso i askwhats the difference and theres so much more lets us not forget this gentleman
SubredditDrama,removed,its not your views its the fact that you take massive dumps all over reddit and have ruined the site for everyone but trump fanboys i mean yeah i disagree with your views but theres a reason i would celebrate td being banned and not rconservative rlibertarian rchristianity rcommunism rislam rchangemyview etc you guys cant accept the fact that everyone genuinely dislikes your sub as a quality of life issue so you have to cry fowl and claim youre being discriminated against that or pretend everyone who speaks out against you is a shill also you guys love bans whats the big problem
SubredditDrama,removed,im okay with punching self identifying nazis im also okay with punching self identifying terrorists or pedophiles or pretty much anything thats objectively detestable fight me ya fat neckbearded twat
SubredditDrama,removed,you guys seriously know nothing about us do you skip to
SubredditDrama,removed,your right to free speech ends where our safe space begins reddit

SubredditDrama,removed,am liberal bashing a fascist is never bad we had a way over it and everything
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck yourself you stupid cunt
SubredditDrama,removed,bitch where
SubredditDrama,removed,im not a lawyer but as far as i understand it sexual harassment is like telling your coworker she should wear shorter skirts because she has nice legs or dropping your pencil on the ground and asking her to pick it up shit like that flashing people is sexual assault and if i sent you a text message saying i want to fucking kill you that would be assault so by the transitive property im saying that sending unsolicited dick picks would also be assault
SubredditDrama,removed,typical gun freak
SubredditDrama,removed,you know i was surprised with how few catty bitches were in this drama subreddit and then you came along
SubredditDrama,removed,literally kill yourself

SubredditDrama,removed,i remember trying to take it then stopping cus i hated some of the questions plus im just lazy
SubredditDrama,removed,malcolm x said fight down votes with down votes
SubredditDrama,removed,the bible is garbage written by middle eastern goat fuckers then cherry picked by christians to fit how they want their world to see its lead to more war death rape and destruction than any other publication and the funny thing is its just a bunch of bullshit so take your copy turn it sideways and shoe it up your ass at a gay marriage well all be better off that way
SubredditDrama,removed,i really wish people would stop using autism as an insult good luck with that retard
SubredditDrama,removed,y you cant how dare you be a tword supporter get out ban ban ban ban ban ban ban ban ban
SubredditDrama,removed,oh no people on an internet forum who like to other people on the internet argue will think me immature what ever will i do dont be surprised if people consider you an overlysensitive sjw who gets off on being offended
SubredditDrama,removed,read the second sentence and look at your post history im sure youll figure it out
SubredditDrama,removed,no one cares yours is adorable though hehehehehee
SubredditDrama,removed,itt lots of socially awkward people who seem creepy but dont know it defending the guy who wrote the napkin letter the lack of self awareness is astounding instead of seeing that many people find this behaviour creepy and learning about how some other people see situations they decide to argue about it yes not everyone this this is creepy maybe not even a majority of people however the informal rules of social interaction arent decided on in a democratic system and disagreeing with those rules is futile in real life situations these people need to get a clue
SubredditDrama,removed,at least hes smart enough to realize slavic males have no place in the worlds future
SubredditDrama,removed,its your misandry that gives you that vibe
SubredditDrama,removed,people
SubredditDrama,removed,how so im just stating facts brah
SubredditDrama,removed,have you ever had to actually interact with slavs in real life there are a lot of polish in my neighborhood and let me tell you their behavior is disturbing they are constantly passing out drunk in the parks leaving us to hear their early morning wake ups when their wives find them and give them a tongue lashing the men constantly make lewd comments to my fiance about her breasts and legs the moment shes not wearing a huge parka outside its just unacceptable behavior to anyone thats not a caveman in
SubredditDrama,removed,well you know what they say hard to tell the bums from the poles sometimes
SubredditDrama,removed,just an fyi im about done with this so can tune it out you mam mods are really a waste of air and ive accomplished all that is needed getting some attention on your pathetic bullshit getting this out of the new subreddit so im out done with you and your pissy miserable existance ps ban me i guarantee it has no impact and i give zero fucks
SubredditDrama,removed,what a sad little life you live
SubredditDrama,removed,just noticed that myself thats pretty annoying
SubredditDrama,removed,lol dont brag about dling unless youre utovero
SubredditDrama,removed,drama in an aviation thread
SubredditDrama,removed,you lack the intelligence to participate constructively in this discussion as such youre blocked
SubredditDrama,removed,pretty diverse yeah theres teenage white male garbage people teenage white male trash people teenage white male sewer people its quite a melting pot
SubredditDrama,removed,what the fuck is wrong with that what if we send million white people to a small african country with a million population or million blacks to israel
SubredditDrama,removed,you are an enormous pussy dude no one is trolling you youre just a vapid thinskinned baby person sad thing is youre completely immune to introspection youre gonna read this think im getting le troled and never once consider that something about you has to fundamentally change before you can even begin to be a worthwhile person that or youre trolling in which case i dont know i hope youre having fun i guess
SubredditDrama,removed,rdrama is a subreddit for pathetic cucks and white genocide supporters
SubredditDrama,removed,i know i am speaking about europe which he presumably did too because he said our homelands
SubredditDrama,removed,whoa there please watch your language uidreamaboutcheese
SubredditDrama,removed,update shadowbanned for hate speech
SubredditDrama,removed,take this abortion poll for a school project it will only take a few minutes
SubredditDrama,removed,arts is that some sort of obscure term for assfaggots
SubredditDrama,removed,maybe you can only post on reddit because youre obsessed with your internet persona im just bored and like to call out liars and dishonest people dont project your shit onto me and then claim its my problem you know youre on rsubredditdrama right so youre in a sub dedicated to reddit drama but too dense to understand the concept of enjoying the drama
SubredditDrama,removed,did you hear trans people are undercover gay virus transmitters
SubredditDrama,removed,excluding rape and sexual assault any reasonable person would just not continue on once they found out the person was a trap if you somehow dont understand how parts work and then feel fooled afterward then you deserve what you got
SubredditDrama,removed,mutilating your genitals isnt the same as having a natural penis or vagina many individuals wouldnt find that appealing
SubredditDrama,removed,kind of how when a person makes a mistake on a subreddit rworldneww you moderate by not reading one rule you ban them outright then when they question the ruling you permanently ban them sounds likes a legit way to utterly destroy these communities
SubredditDrama,removed,why is it so harfd to understand that just because you are ok with it doesnt meaqn that the vast majority is why cant you respect peoples sexual identities shouldnt trans people be especially understamding about personal sexual desires and not forcing them on others why not just be honest is deception the only way to get laid is it worth it to knowingly cause emotional distress to people in order to get laid what about longer term relationships its good to get things started with a massive lie by omission how is any of that ok to harm people just to serve your sexual gratification httpsenwikipediaorgwikirapebydeception
SubredditDrama,removed,no but thats obviously not the example being discussed why would someone only discover after the fact that the woman with a penis they had sex withshes trans dont pull in some weirdo false equivalence in order to justify your transphobia
SubredditDrama,removed,the law in november british judge roger dutton sentenced a woman gayle newland to eight years in prison for pretending to be a man as a means having sex with an unnamed woman of the same age didnt see feminists defending the right to rape a woman curiously but apparently its ok to rape men because they are just emotionally too immature when they feel violated men dont have the right to decide about their own sexual identity they need to be forced to comform to my sexual desires by rape if necessary well call it correctional rape íf they get raped enough the will eventually be ok with it
SubredditDrama,removed,i like gawker as cesspools go at least its a smarter wittier more liberal cesspool than this one present company excluded
SubredditDrama,removed,so its ok to rape people by deception if you are trans what is the difference you know people would nt concent if you told the truth sex without concent is rape
SubredditDrama,removed,so once you find out someone you were previously attracted to has a penis that gets rid of any previous attraction yes preop trans women will tell you before it gets anywhere near that stage so were back to the beginning it is okay to discriminate against having sex with someone if they are preop but its okay as long as its in their rational self interest to divulge the information but its not okay if they dont once they are postop lot of rules here to keep track to ensure im not a bigot because of my sexual attractions that im not in control of
SubredditDrama,removed,trans women arent lying and scheming to get your straightboy dick dude chill the fuck out
SubredditDrama,removed,moralizing about child porn bold card for a redditor to play
SubredditDrama,removed,its the same law one which feminists and progressives spearheaded including the rape by deception part
SubredditDrama,removed,correction because youre totally vanilla white bread booooooring
SubredditDrama,removed,youre so hung up on this i can only imagine you had an affair and didnt tell your mistress im not understanding why youve brought this up at least times in one thread thats focused on trans issues
SubredditDrama,removed,all right i take back what i said about present company
SubredditDrama,removed,too many times you read stories where they seem to get off fooling others cuz they somehow think its funny too many times you watch shitty comedies ftfy
SubredditDrama,removed,youre not weird you just have a healthy masculinity something that almost everybody in that thread lacks dont be sad that you dont empathize with degenerate twisted people
SubredditDrama,removed,remember though redditors totally dont want the government to get involved in their bedrooms this is a progressive website
SubredditDrama,removed,no youre a truthphobe fuck you for calling me a transphobe because whenever lgbt rights issues come up in social situations i always support a persons right to be who they want to be youre the intolerant asshole you believe if someone doesnt believe the way that you do theyre wrong even though youre opinions arent even based in facts at least when i call someone a racist bigot or prejudice i know what the definition is you dont even know the definition to transphobia and youre transgenderd which just goes to show that being part of a minority thats discriminated against doesnt necessarily make you more informed because youre obviously a fucking idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,wow this current brand of anti immigrant hatred is pretty revolting people calling for the deportation of kids who will do nothing but add value to our society just because makes me sad i hope those kids get into excellent colleges have bright futures and that all the posters upvoting this racist shit get genital warts
SubredditDrama,removed,this particular opinion gets a fuck you from me but theyre welcome to hold it free country and all and im free to wish genital warts on them
SubredditDrama,removed,oh eat a dick and read a book fucking learn something dumbass my sexual and gender preference is female and woman me not wanting to sleep with a trans woman is no different than a lesbian not wanting to sleep with a cis man the world doesnt revolve are you or me or our preferences
SubredditDrama,removed,suck a dick and die that personal enough for you bitch
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah im sure someone else came by and upvoted an irrelevant comment more likely you realized what an idiot you were being and unvoted nah youre right thats unlikely too lol just go fuck off and annoy somebody else aw he likes me
SubredditDrama,removed,lots of sjws in this sub
SubredditDrama,removed,some of us arent fucking degenerates
SubredditDrama,removed,alright let me play devils advocate for the last years of human history there have been two genders no fuckin arguments about it but then because of advances in medical science people can now switch why are people who look at the entirety of human history considered bigots in this area this is a fucking outlier since you love science so much these people are confused at best or mentally ill at worst
SubredditDrama,removed,trans people are neither women nor men
SubredditDrama,removed,fuuuuuuck you
SubredditDrama,removed,straight men generally dont want to have sex with men sorry if that offends you would you have such a flippant attitude if a gay man was saying he didnt want to sleep with a trans man somehow i doubt you would be saying yeah man what if you become straight in that case
SubredditDrama,removed,thats because trans apologists usually have a mental disorder as well
SubredditDrama,removed,but thats not an analogous situation in the lesbian situation its still a trans woman coming onto the lesbian who has no idea that the trans woman isnt cis maybe the lesbian takes this woman home they spend a great night together and the lesbian still has no idea her date is trans the lesbian is in the exact same situation as you since were talking about trans women not men in disguises or whatever youre implying
SubredditDrama,removed,yeahthats not okay and the whole if you think its sexual thats on you playing dumb shtick is just infuriating how come i visited the subs and they were just subs with pictures of very beautiful underage girls doing poses and facial expressions that made them look good but nothing explicitly sexual but i guess its a matter of cultural values there are some folks who think that showing female hair face and ankles is sexual and must be hidden from the public others advocate for public breastfeeding because why do people sexualize breasts
SubredditDrama,removed,did you make a wrong turn at drama
SubredditDrama,removed,deport dogfuckers
SubredditDrama,removed,you dont think theres anything suspect about people aggregating suggestive pictures of prepubescent girls and other people perusing and commenting on them youre either deluded or a paedophile
SubredditDrama,removed,jdbdeb
SubredditDrama,removed,in a few years people gonna move on from gaystrans peopleetc and sjws going to talk about pedophile rights on the internet lol
SubredditDrama,removed,watch some anime speaking of pedophilic media
SubredditDrama,removed,o no dramamine is mad at me again
SubredditDrama,removed,now youre really hurting my feelings
SubredditDrama,removed,aint no retard meat going in my mouth whatever i eat has to be at least as intelligent as your average clam

SubredditDrama,removed,one thing rconservative and rshitrconservativesays can agree on is that unedstarch is annoying af
SubredditDrama,removed,is that rule why you post in every srd thread is there even an srd thread where i can call you a massive shit stew with solid balls of shit diarrhoea gravy and a green baby shit side without breaking a rule shit well i hope you enjoy the mental image of that if you think its gross now wait till you imagine your loved one eating it the next time you kiss them

SubredditDrama,removed,he has a good point though
SubredditDrama,removed,so basically all of reddit there are very few subs where you can critique sexualized women without accusations of being triggered getting thrown around
SubredditDrama,removed,some dudes panic when they think their boners are under attack
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,tumblr is just a website and people would have all sorts of different opinions about it yet somehow we arent allowed to make the same point about reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,hey a drama i saw before it got posted for once the comments on that thread actually surprised me in most subreddits at least the ones ive seen the altright is viewed more favorably its refreshing to see their garbage in the negatives for once
SubredditDrama,removed,its a drawing the autism in this thread about it is giving me a headache
SubredditDrama,removed,oh an anecdote i guess all white people are racist because one called me a wetback
SubredditDrama,removed,im youre able to just declare that something doesnt happen without supporting evidence
SubredditDrama,removed,i wrote a blog post a while ago about why i fucking hate video games because this is what it does appeals to like the male fantasy
SubredditDrama,removed,if he meant that people say that sometimes and get downvoted how would that habe been relevant are you actually dumb
SubredditDrama,removed,suboxone doesnt get you high and it has a ceiling effect that makes it inactive and to start having the opposite effect once you go over a certain dosage its basically made so it cannot be abused its saved my life and millions of others get off your retarded horse and stop talking out of your ass
SubredditDrama,removed,lol is that a parody false flag
SubredditDrama,removed,no shit this isnt hard why are you playing dumb ugorbijones
SubredditDrama,removed,redditeurs are not exactly experts when it comes to consent
SubredditDrama,removed,is that why she is so shit
SubredditDrama,removed,i
SubredditDrama,removed,that thread really devolved into racist rants that were even upvoted because they were against ushaqup lol see no islam creates terrorists youre uneducated and stupid though so its hard to grasp such concepts also just had lunch it was probably more than youve eaten in a week
SubredditDrama,removed,is there an uncle tom for gay people
SubredditDrama,removed,found the retard
SubredditDrama,removed,to claim that those comments dont read like a joke is amazing im done i get it i hurt your feelings
SubredditDrama,removed,neither is labeling an entire demographic as misogynistic but thats just the way retards roll
SubredditDrama,removed,what is it with this sub and the spoiled kids analogy it seems like any kind of political idea that doesnt fit the hivemind here is almost just referred to as a tantrum or throwing the toys from the pram and calling everyone spoiled kids how exactly are they spoiled kids by not wanting the guy to be banned from twitter and saying so i really think its just a tool for you to dismiss what they are saying without actually listening to it because if you did you might have to realise it is totally egregious to ban someone from twitter for having controversial views
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit my mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and i literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand she started yelling and swearing at me and i slammed the door on her im so distressed right now i dont know what to do i didnt mean to do that to my mom but im literally in shock from milos twitter ban i feel like im going to explode why the fucking fuck is he banned this cant be happening im having a fucking breakdown i dont want to believe the world is so politically correct i want a dangerous faggot to believe in i want milo to be back on twitter and trigger all these sjws i cannot fucking deal with this right now it wasnt supposed to be like this i thought he had free speech this is so fucked
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,exactly i definitely dont have a big dick and no one has ever said anything to me mind you im a virgin so my experience might be irrelevant ya think the obvious solution is to not sexually harass or abuse someone by showing them your dick if they didnt indicate that they wanted to see it and if you do the consequences are pretty much on you but it is funny that the crowd that is most against body shaming usually dont have a problem with this just like how theres always some people who while criticizing a guy that said a girl is fat and unloveable call him a neckbeard and say thats why he cant get a date in the very next breath
SubredditDrama,removed,whats the difference between miming eating a roast beef sandwich and a normal sandwich or even a burger
SubredditDrama,removed,particularly the metas outraged offended and upset
SubredditDrama,removed,lol jesus christ
SubredditDrama,removed,im nowhere near progressive chucklefuck i havent had a lobotomy and i dont jerk it to dudes kissing for starters
SubredditDrama,removed,well holmes youve done it again it turns out the guy mocking progressives overreliance on effete factors like empathy is not in fact progressive you must work for nasa with a steel trap mind like that
SubredditDrama,removed,childbirth is basically child rape
SubredditDrama,removed,english aint your strong suit goes to show that all that free education for illegal immigrants isnt working too well doesnt it
SubredditDrama,removed,just so ive got this straight you wandered off to thesauruscom in a desperate bid to look like you actually knew some synonyms for effete but couldnt be bothered to hop right next door to dictionarycom to check on how to spell et cetera
SubredditDrama,removed,ill leave that to experienced parttime baristas like yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,to be clear no one here is eating srdines except maybe and uzachums and they are only doing that to each other also you shouldnt say an srdine it sounds too much like ansar dine thats how you end up on a terrorist watch list
SubredditDrama,removed,theres a network of similar subs so dont be surprised if youre banned from others too
SubredditDrama,removed,just from the title i was like oh man here come the fucking vultures this is reddits big theme that feminism is just a bunch of pampered western pansies who ought to be grateful theyre not bundled in burqas or being honor killed or stoned to death for driving as if you can only address one injustice at a time globally this is the reddit manospheres favorite fetish and its so fucking obnoxious i dunno if op of that thread is just a troll or genuinely did not know she was stirring shit but i took one look at that fatuous fucking title and went nope nope nope
SubredditDrama,removed,double yoo double yoo double yoo reddit dot com
SubredditDrama,removed,the male ego can be so fragile
SubredditDrama,removed,all my albums are available for free download here httpsthetalentlessmrpopebandcampcom i am mr pope the founder of the peoples love cult the first band that is also a religion
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont knowwhen i heard that person with a guitar on youtubesomething struck me it hadnt been done before mr pope am this morning these elusive comments were made by a crazed musician and lay minister founder of a controversial rock band known as the peoples love cult a so called character who goes by the name of mr pope he was so unmoved allegedly by the comments apparently this is all in promotion for his new hit single death of a pretty boy
SubredditDrama,removed,when i was months old i was taken to see the mona lisa my parents told me i was reaching my hands out to grab it this was when i knew i was born to be an artist a da vinci mr pope httpsuddtbabandcampcomalbumthemania sneak peek at the upcoming album join me probably meh are you a fucking musician have you been in crutches just for the sound of your voice no youre a faceless one sider that has been within the walls of youtube many times have i heard this before i prefer me over meh mr pope from the rock opera epic the house of eyes and other stories httpssoundcloudcomnikstefanovikiamyou
SubredditDrama,removed,mr pope began his career after falling into a time warp tempted by an unknon entity known as the vaporwave he fell somewhere in the northeast between brooklyn and newark it was what he described as a vision of hell around this time he was possessed by a famous producer and satanist known only as drop former collaborator of chance the rapper and lotus who recorded his first ep httpsmrpopetheplcbandcampcomalbumwhoismisterpope
SubredditDrama,removed,this song concerns a common crisis i faced back in when she first did touch me in a life before it led to my death the year of my drowning but for some this was merely a baptism the erection is the obelisk the tower and the mona lisa as gira once said is the mother earth httpsthetalentlessmrpopebandcampcomtracktouchofevil for more on the obelisk see plc album httpsthetalentlessmrpopebandcampcomalbumtheobelisk i havent heard of you no results found mr pope
SubredditDrama,removed,it was on the fifth night of his crucible when the legacy had been foretold seven witches all disguised as nuns there had been a covenant for ages severing all the pagan origins of the church but the clergy knew my name httpsthetalentlessmrpopebandcampcomalbumthesisterhoodoftheuniontrinitybooki for further reading the house was where it all began
SubredditDrama,removed,tell us the difference you paste eater clearly not
SubredditDrama,removed,the poster of the elusive song was a part of an elaborate scheme to cover up st vincents career the council had been informed by the mother of horse eyes we had to teleport several channels in both theory and wavelength simply to restore the pure blood of the lost one the stench of a cousin for further reading httpsthetalentlessmrpopebandcampcomtrackstenchofacousinopal i had been told i would last in the free market of new media so i had to start my own religion it had to be more than just a band i was told there was a shortage of original music because the hypnosis of cover artists became too strong as the illusion of choice the mad cult leader httpsthetalentlessmrpopebandcampcomalbumjoinus and so he proclaimed
SubredditDrama,removed,say that to my records and not my face and see what happens pussy
SubredditDrama,removed,you sjws are hypocriteson our subreddit we are free to say whatever we want without cucks banning us
SubredditDrama,removed,i hope he has nightmares of dead iraqi children cause sadly thats the only justice theyll ever receive
SubredditDrama,removed,youre being downvoted because youre a pretentious douchenozzel
SubredditDrama,removed,what was that why do you keep responding what kind of piece of shit thinks they can speak and respond ad nauseum yet other people should just shut up as long as pieces of shit want to trumpet their ignorance especially in the way it goes down around here i will keep responding as far as im concerned not one of you has strongly refuted my claims beyond the borderline perception of the car being in motion arent you one of the retards whos incapable of reading a wiki page that thinks appeals to authority are only fallacious if the authority is a hack you havent been keeping up with your own thoughts maybe you should stop responding oh and a scald on me or you would be a third degree burn on an year olds paper thin skin
SubredditDrama,removed,no i read it there might have been a shift but the point remains the same authority is not inherently right just because its authority and judges get things wrong too citing that the judge disagrees with me isnt an argument its an appeal to authority and stupid carry on
SubredditDrama,removed,oh i should simply defer to people with legal training and authority because thats smart huh spoken like a true moron sheep who still doesnt understand why an appeal to authority is fallacious one time i was arrested with a pound of marijuana my lawyer told me to take a plea deal that still would have involved a felony i told him to fuck himself and fight the case the way i wanted it i won charges dropped if i had followed my trained paid legal professionals advice i would be in a very different position in life right now if you want to defer to people because thinking is too hard for you you probably should because you obviously arent comfortable with thinking for yourself but im not that person
SubredditDrama,removed,relevant fact you mean plaintiff testimony not that it changes a damn thing because it was still her who spilled the coffee should mcds also be liable for her dry cleaning surely its their fault that her pants are stained as well maybe i should sue the bar where i spilled ranch on my shirt i really liked that shirt seems like its not a scald then before this case did you not think that coffee was hot enough to burn you thank god then we need more cases like this so we can ensure all the yokels that would have been picked off by darwinism end up defining life for the nonincompetents so lets cater to the lowest common denominator some more dont forget to read the sign that says people do not belong in tumble dryer
SubredditDrama,removed,i know youre a jackass
SubredditDrama,removed,wtf you are just some violent minded person chill at rthedonald where they not violent enough for you get help
SubredditDrama,removed,i love how angry this makes all of you how dare a man have standards that he himself adheres to a woman that doesnt want to marry a poor man fine a woman that doesnt want to marry a short man fine a man that doesnt want to marry a woman thats had sex what a monster as i said the reason i have my standards is for moral personal and religious reasons the fact that it makes hypocritical and hateful feminists such as yourselves so angry and butthurt is an added bonus p i think you all need to mature and respect the fact that not everyone shares your sjw hive mind views and there are people out there who still value virginity but given your personalities and nature im guessing youll all stay in the same infantile mindset peace and god bless you
SubredditDrama,removed,he sounds like he may be autistic
SubredditDrama,removed,ew theres nothing more disgusting than people valuing virginity i can think of a few things more disgusting namely a woman whos a slut and has lots of promiscuous sex

SubredditDrama,removed,itt i didnt read much of the thread i just saw a deleted post and reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee op here also features one of the top mods chiming in to verbally abuse any users critical of breitbart also this from the same mod see this is a good post calling out breitbarts integrityfor the record i dont get my news from breitbart and i dont get my news from the daily herald i wasnt defending breitbart as much as i was arguing the point it was in reply to a post that actually brings reason and doesnt just plainly make unsourced assertions also the sub has rules uncensored anarchy one such is calling a story fake news or some similar formula without an effort to back that up will incur an immediate ban you are always welcome to criticize a story if you explain your reasoning but no no reeeeeeeeeeee away srd dont let someone stop you from doing what you do best for the record i never have been and likely will never go to that sub again unless i see suspicious shit like op here
SubredditDrama,removed,nevermind that i actually read the thread and bring up salient points as a means of describing exactly what is wrong with the thread if i was trying to start an argument id be fucking with the people saying the dumb shit directly instead of reporting the thread itself as grandstanding i suppose you wouldnt know that since reports are anonymous i imagine you deduced it though and are just pissy or is that giving you too much credit nevermind that youre calling me out in public with it instead of using pm because you cant even follow your own fucking advice because you think youre judge dredd or some shit see ya wouldnt want to be ya
SubredditDrama,removed,fwiw most europeans i know have a problem with the organized beggar mafia in western europe
SubredditDrama,removed,huh i though youd probably ban me after that stern warning and then my reply that is pretty basically the kind of thing we dont want in srd well duh you dont like it when the narrative gets mocked and subsequently nailed to the fucking wall which ive noticed since others are calling out similar points what echo chamber would like that roughly zip zilch none thats why youre calling me out publicly like this and not the masses that are obviously swallowing and repeating the op narrative based pretty much on faith and following blindly like good little prejudiced childrenwhich is the whole purpose for itt posts where there are entirely too many individuals screeching to reply to personally
SubredditDrama,removed,not surprised looked at the expense of the garbage
SubredditDrama,removed,oy vey the goyim know
SubredditDrama,removed,prove me wrong
SubredditDrama,removed,ubluequail seems like the tomi lahren of reddit aka the most special snowflake douche of them all
SubredditDrama,removed,google wants open borders so they can continue to abuse visas by importing cheaper labor and undercutting the bargaining power of american workers how noble of them
SubredditDrama,removed,heres hoping that guy looks back on that post in a year and realizes what a fucking gigantic asshole he was perhaps after he gains some introspec is redditor oh no its a terminal case
SubredditDrama,removed,you accuse the right of brigading and yet the left is equally guilty god forbid anyone spoke ill against hillary during that election and there was plenty of ill words to be spoken face it the nation is divided more than ever that is obamas legacy
SubredditDrama,removed,not on very specific subreddits protecting her agenda something major had to occur for her to negatively frontpage on pol or news
SubredditDrama,removed,neither of those are supposed to have an agenda logic is hard
SubredditDrama,removed,i didnt vote for either i dont support trump reading is hard when youre so easily triggered
SubredditDrama,removed,yes one of them an independent who voted green party because both choices were digusting humans
SubredditDrama,removed,im not a trump supporter i voted green because both candiates were disgusting humans honestly i want you all to sit down and realize how fucking stupid you are thats why i responded to some fucking nitwit saying the right was brigading im sick of sitting here watching hypocrites name call
SubredditDrama,removed,hide what that i think youre a fucking weirdo who is so easily triggered you have to pm people guess what i didnt vote for either i think youre fucking retarded and so are about of both sides get cancer and die preferably before the next election cycle
SubredditDrama,removed,i wish i could tell everyone that its okay to have voted for trump its okay to support him but its also okay to say hes going to far with this executive order i think the entire reddit community could learn something from this as outrageous as the antitrump hysteria is there are aspects of this order that cross a fundamental line in americas history th
SubredditDrama,removed,post is just hot air as long as they allow this site to serve as an unmitigated incubator and recruiting ground for racists and literal actual nazis fuck reddit tbh
SubredditDrama,removed,oh well time to unsubscribe thats sad i subscribed there last week thats a dumb thing to admit but dumbly admitting it totally jives with enjoying that sub this all adds up for me
SubredditDrama,removed,fucking nigger well then
SubredditDrama,removed,i hope it never does it was such a shit subreddit
SubredditDrama,removed,this person is a mod for a sub that perpetuates negative black stereotypes he knows his racism
SubredditDrama,removed,shut up faggot
SubredditDrama,removed,im pretty sure its a joke and if it isnt then well shit it was the last bastion of funnyoffensive content would really hate to see this place gone it was like an emotionallysafe zone in the ocean of filth such as cucks fags and tolerasts and antiracists
SubredditDrama,removed,congrats youre at level
SubredditDrama,removed,this response continues to confirm my opinion that americans are extremely sheltered
SubredditDrama,removed,i think there is a large number of redditors who get way too much of their life experience through media like video games and movies they have a warped sense of the world because they either get fictional information or the extreme examples like the new stories that get upvoted on reddit thats why a lot of their rhetoric seems like its coming from a poorly written character
SubredditDrama,removed,people who dont go outside and have no frame of reference for reality you could have just said redditors
SubredditDrama,removed,they took credit for starting multiple riots on purpose lol getting your opponent to start shit to look bad has been the goal of peaceful protests since their inception like that was gandhis whole game plan theres nothing wrong with showing how violent trump supporters are as for the second ok plausible deniability of what literally nothing in that comment and by extension im assuming the video shows anything lmao but still no legitimate source so i guess i can safely just ignore your idiocy
SubredditDrama,removed,his
SubredditDrama,removed,sanders probably loses anyway i agree but i still dont forgive hillary for all the shady shit oh and by the way being meta and self aware of your smugness doesnt make you any less of a tremendous douchebag i apologize for using such harsh language but people like you really suck
SubredditDrama,removed,wow fuck this guy one of those dark realities is that people are simply not free to do what they want without consequence even if we think one should be able to on a fundamental level this shows the internally conflicting mindset of the omg women who get assaulted just need to do x on the one hand he believes that x number of men are going to commit rape in the same way later he likens it to drug use where there can be no intervening cause aside from the victims actions on the other hand he also appears to want to believe that if women engaged in actions to make them safer it would actually reduce the incidence of rape recurring theme if every woman were as good as his friends who experience a low incidence of rape note how he doesnt call it that or even sexual assault would there be less rape if the answer is yes were in a situation with a man who can choose not to rape if the stimuli arent sufficient to make him rape if the answer is no his tips only provide relative protection from rape his friends are safer only to the extent another woman is a better target and only work for the surprisingly small incidence of stranger as opposed to acquaintance rape yeah and being a drug user isnt the problem either right its the drugs that are killing them a human being has agency including a rapist drugs have no agency bad analogy so regardless what do you say to all those grey areas and false reports im the first to disagree with how rainn keeps track of rape claims and the percent false versus the total wherein they take every report as a true rape unless the claimaint was herself convicted but treats a conviction rate as look at all the rapists getting away with it but the rate of abjectly false accusations are pretty low the correct statement would be that in of cases we know rape occurred in we know the report was false and in of cases we dont have enough evidence to conclude in either direction ive been preaching that the real solution is to accept the realities educate women and mitigate risks ill give him the benefit of the unearned doubt that he means a focus on actual safety tips rather than the bullshit well if only you didnt wear that skirt advice that advice is all focused on the prospect of random dude at a bar going at her when the vast majority of rape is perpetrated by people the victim knows itd be like advising people to avoid murder by not getting into the drug trade while most murders are from people the victim knows
SubredditDrama,removed,this is the second topic in a row ive looked at where the drama stems from uandrewwaldron
SubredditDrama,removed,dont worry soon you can be my autist pet and ill take care of you
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks for agreeing that routine infant circumcision is genital mutilation and a violation of a child d
SubredditDrama,removed,okay what is the most important issue in the world you better not care about anything other than that you better spend all of your time and energy on one issue because after all we are only capable of caring about one thing right
SubredditDrama,removed,its like god they could be bringing up actual issues but that would have actual opposition rather than just getting a negative comment from other stupid nerds that will only argue about circumcision on reddit and facebook because nobody offline gives a shit about such a non issue people are out there debating racism homophobia sexism classism economic issues environmental issues but on reddit we have fucking circumcision debates
SubredditDrama,removed,bullshit there are lots of circumcised people who hate circumcision and think it is wrong
SubredditDrama,removed,wrong crime also constitutes an action or activity that although not illegal is considered to be evil shameful or wrong the word has more than one meaning
SubredditDrama,removed,absolutely stumped and cucked

SubredditDrama,removed,what is it with you obvious trolls and replying to multiple comments i make god you stupid pricks are so obvious and unfunny you cant bait people and you drop the fucking ball so fast its like you dont have hands

SubredditDrama,removed,nope just a reality check for morons that joke about dumb shit you made a dumb assumption get over it fag said by the white knighter holy shit the irony of a homophobic pc white knighter
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit is a den of left leaning liberals clearly
SubredditDrama,removed,much of reddit also likes to demonize women for being sluts because they are socially retarded neckbeards
SubredditDrama,removed,im certain you have some kind of source preferably a survey conducted by a reputable firm showing a significant number of parents stating they circumcised based on those factors absent their belief in the medical benefits since otherwise this would be both entirely fatuous and profoundly disingenuous thats not something youd do right christ you are annoying ill speak in a more honest manner than you did and provide a study fuck off you twat and reported that the father was circumsiced as a reason and hygiene those arent quite medical reasons except that the value of integrity in this debate only matters in relation to the value of circumcision youre trying to create a more reasonable argument for anticircumcision advocates than their standard i dont think its beneficial therefore its a violation of bodily autonomy that doesnt make sense the argument is that its always a violation of bodily integrity its called out specifically that way because its not common to call justified medical interventions that way the debate of whether the benefits of circumcision justifies violating bodily autonomy exists only because everyone discussing it already believes in bodily autonomy and not everyone believes the same consider that the hygiene argument is given cutting off a body part of another person to save them the perceived hassle of cleaning it is not very respectful of their body
SubredditDrama,removed,youre in high school youre a nerd who tried football but when given the ball you fumbled it and shat your pants then a jock picked it up and ran a touchdown then ran over to you and slapped your face until it was red all the kids are laughing at you now im saying you dropped the ball try again next season nerd

SubredditDrama,removed,bonus calls to also ban srd too lol that is jebusgobson rsubredditdrama mod you done got trolled
SubredditDrama,removed,in all fairness to you regularly recognizing the names of redditors is not something im particularly proud of
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess all the high school students are in class still i get your sentiment at one point i used to brush off half the stupid comments on reddit thinking meh theyre probably just kids i was a dumb kid on the internet once its not indicative of what the average adult really believes then this election happened then trump happened and all the people who agree with his more batshit crazy statements i dont think we can take for granted that these people are just kids any longer we have to accept that there is a large population of fullgrown adults who act like children with poor critical thinking skills
SubredditDrama,removed,as long as were using dramatic overthetop references to prove our points here you go either youre naive and havent been bitchslapped by reality yet are far more people who value social norms like not promoting racism not electing sexual assaulters etc
SubredditDrama,removed,not at all those cucks are idiots im sure most of them supported it
SubredditDrama,removed,i personally dont like the sub much but ill be damned if they dont allow people to voice their opinion on how much they hate srs well i wouldnt go that far im banned from srs for criticizing one of the more ridiculous submissions rule x srs is a circlequeef and interrupting the circlequeef is an easy way to get banned i no doubt deserved to be banned for breaking their number one rule but lets not pretend this is a sub that tolerates and embraces dissension
SubredditDrama,removed,pretty obvious they are just banned from the front page they havent had a sticky in hours and they have dozens of posts with upwards of upvotes that werent stickied disgusting behavior from cuck uspez
SubredditDrama,removed,how the fuck did that autistic fuck show humility hes just saving face

SubredditDrama,removed,my god white people are the most sensitive race known to man
SubredditDrama,removed,and they dont care about the sexual exploitation of children or their own website getting socially dominated by pedophiles as long as it isnt legally inconvenient what utterly moronic pieces of filth
SubredditDrama,removed,man reddit is like a case study of everything that is morally and politically wrong with modern society factions of narcissistic selfinterested extremists harassing each other check a fundamentally incoherent and manipulative moral discourse based around conflicting rights to be as much of an asshole as you feel like being check technocratic morally apathetic and overall incompetent elites who resent the people they govern and default to appeasing whoever is the most powerful faction literal pedophiles in this case check
SubredditDrama,removed,youre very misinformed and i know im not racist so i dont really give a shit how you brand me
SubredditDrama,removed,and now even that doesnt work anymore all you see in the mainstream media about reddit nowadays is how it is the largest hate site in the world and the operations base of the altright but the admins dont care because thats their core userbase now and so racism sexism and fascism are what keep the lights on at reddit hq
SubredditDrama,removed,once the protest turned into a riot protest is over disperse go home or get tear gassed ferguson turned into a riot i know this a hard concept for an idiot such as yourself but even if not every single protestor is violent once the protest has sparked a riot it is in the interest of the public good to disperse all of the activity to minimize injuries and damages of course massive swarms of angry people dont t move freely so you use tear gas to gain compliance
SubredditDrama,removed,and that nobody who uses it actually enjoys i guess racking up all that karma must have been torture of the highest order
SubredditDrama,removed,maby her dad wants her to have a better future than some fucktard in a rice rocket with a monster energy drink tattoo on his arm
SubredditDrama,removed,regardless they had a semiorganized exodus from reddit people like kaliyugaz here seems to think reddit is literally hitler and completely unenjoyable but apparently cant find the will to not give pageviews to this antichrist incarnation of a website its like i get it you hate reddit so why not just fuck off already

SubredditDrama,removed,you make some good points but something tells me your biased uoldvirginloner
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont think ulordtuts is canadian the op was probably confusing him with the who is following through
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck ulordtuts cant believe the rkarmacourt found him not guilty
SubredditDrama,removed,are you the kind of person who tells gay people that faggot just means a bundle of sticks and that they shouldnt be offended by it
SubredditDrama,removed,if a gamer subreddit says its not racist its almost certainly racist
SubredditDrama,removed,what even is politics anymore
SubredditDrama,removed,young people are becoming more conservative how is that even possible almost all media feels pretty liberal or at least has liberal leaning or am i mistaken
SubredditDrama,removed,so they all wanted someone to get an awful tattoo that would stay there for life just so they could feel superior and say haha what a dumbass not at all idk maybe im alone it this but i would have thought very highly of the guy what he said he was going to do would have taken balls if i had the balls to do it i would get fuck ulordtuts tattooed on my ass too sure some people would have called him an idiot for it thats part of why it would have taken balls to do but i think most of the people who actually upvoted would have respected that he delivered
SubredditDrama,removed,because they are selfcentered narcissists who want an excuse to beat up children whenever they are annoyed by them
SubredditDrama,removed,holy shit nigga

SubredditDrama,removed,you pussies are upset a gamer used a bad word holy shit reddit is fucking pathetic
SubredditDrama,removed,what exactly is nuanced about calling a black person a nigger im curious
SubredditDrama,removed,it certainly makes me feel better knowing im not an ignorant sjw covering up my own latent racism by deflecting and accusing others of being racist for simply uttering one word in a completely nonracist context
SubredditDrama,removed,thats why trump won white guys who dont understand why they cant day nigger and ask why there isnt a white history month
SubredditDrama,removed,and in this context what he said is not fucking racist you ignorant twat
SubredditDrama,removed,whitey aka when mayos too spicy

SubredditDrama,removed,maybe like you he uses a racist slur to refer to people who are trashy and violent you know ugly ugly stereotypes of american black people maybe like you he is racist
SubredditDrama,removed,now youre just fishing for karma going back up the quote chain the last one is here i know youre familiar with that one you had a reply but because you lost your temper at having your own post used to put your argument in shambles and decided to throw a tantrum it got deleted from the threadeven though it still comes up in your post history stay classy
SubredditDrama,removed,you mean the thread where someone who knows what theyre talking about puts you in your place but you keep flailing about like a mackerel youre fucking hilarious im willing to bet youve never once admitted youre wrong about anything have you ever wonder why women dont seem to get you thats why
SubredditDrama,removed,again were not talking about logical fallacies or sat tests were talking about your unwillingness to admit fucking up a childish insult and refusing to let it go despite everyone else in the thread disagreeing with you what will you bring up next in a sad attempt to deflect from an obvious error that youre incapable of admitting to semiotics quantum physics animal husbandry keep it coming im having so much fun
SubredditDrama,removed,is there a new drug that you can huff to be autistic id be willing to try it if it would make sense of this post

SubredditDrama,removed,cause ofc people who dont face hate and prejudice think saying whatever the fuck pops in any fuckers head is more important than preventing the propagation of hate and prejudice

SubredditDrama,removed,there are some common misconceptions of socialism here however heres a usual copypaste that will clear any misunderstandings before any arguments start when talking about economics we talk about distribution and ownership ownership can range from cooperative democratic or social ownership socialism state ownership state capitalism or private ownership capitalism distribution is usually how the goods and services produced by these systems can be distributed in society some ways of doing this is either through a planned economy or a market economy capitalism and socialism are systems of ownership capitalism is a system of ownership where property is privately owned the goods produced on that property do not belong to the workers but the one who owns the property in turn the owner may pay the workers a wage for using that property while they can do anything they want with the goods produced wealth is efficiently produced but theres an issue as to where that wealth goes most countries in the world today are capitalist economies socialists reject this because its an inherently exploitive system of ownership socialism advocates for a system of ownership where workers or society democratically decide what gets produced and those involved enjoy the product equally a socialist business would be run democratically by the workers someone who founds a business can have certain rights to their original intent pay is also determined democratically either through a representative for larger enterprises or directly for small businesses this goes against the hierarchical structure of private property in capitalism and state capitalism nationalized industry you can include markets in both systems workers cooperatives do exist in modern society and ensures worker happiness and fair pay over fast paced and wasteful efficiency the idea behind marxism is that socialists should take control either through elections or revolutions to set up a transition state where essential industries would centralized this transition state would move on towards socialism and eventually communism communism is a stateless classless and cooperative society where automation and rational production allows people to work less and focus on their own development any political ideology that focuses on moving towards a classless stateless and cooperative society in which all major resources are held in common ownership are socialist regardless of the approach that they want to take to get there let me expand on this further china is not stateless but is still a socialist nation because they believe that they will achieve socialism through a transition state where they nationalize all or essential industry this is typical of marxistleninist states marxistleninism advocates for a general strike or violent overthrow that sets up a state that sets policy for the good of the the people rather than the good of the elites a technocratic transition state anarchists are socialists who believe that dismantling the state and replacing it with a democratic manifestation of organization will lead to communism social democrats believe that gradually introducing nonprofit institutions and cooperative businesses will lead to eventual socialism and then communism socialists democratic socialists or market socialists believe that a democratically elected government can make way for the transition to socialist and eventual communist society before there were two major types of socialists revolutionary and evolutionary socialists both were influenced by marxism as the unifying principle for socialism and so they believed only the state can bring about change revolutionaries wanted to overthrow the state through a revolution and lenin was the only one who was successful at the time evolutionary socialists set up political parties called democratic socialist parties and believed winning elections can bring about change eventually lenin was the only one that succeeded and so others followed to start up revolutionary socialist parties called communist parties with the devastating effects of the soviets decided to delay the transition to socialism by setting up collectivist policies that would force farmers to urbanize and work in industry lenin called this statecapitalism state capitalism is a term used by lenin to describe the fact that workers transition from going to jobs under an owner who owned a company to the state that owned the company by the time stalin took power stalin moved on with state ownership of nearly all industry and infamously declared this is socialism people have been describing socialism as state owned industry ever since even going as far as to call the military as a socialist institution the reason for the harsh policies taken on by marxistleninists was because of the fear of famine and invasion with the rise of the internet more people are starting to realize what socialism is here are some other key facts about socialism for a look into how socialist companies can work look into mondragon corporation which is the largest worker owned cooperative and one of the largest most successful companies in europe socialism is generally seen as democratic socialism which can include nonmarket socialism or market socialism nonmarket socialists advocate for decentralized local planning for local use and centralized planning for large scale activities these plans are made by a democratically elected government without the influence of capitalism the idea is that the state would lose its corrupt and bureaucratic function and retain its administrative function to provide the peoples wants and needs this can include the concepts of industrial democracy or economic democracy this may also include consumer planning some notable fictionous examples are included in star trek and red mars market socialism is simply a market economy with large cooperatives socialism operates under postscarcity there is always a scarcity for resources but capitalism is a system that relies on scarcity while socialism acknowledges the limited resources we have and sets up a rational system of distribution based on those resources socialists believe we are either close or already at a point where we no longer have to work hours a week our global agricultural output is kilocalories per person per day we have the ability to provide luxury housing to everyone anywhere they want socialists believe that anything is possible when a society rationally decides production and distribution rather than based on market or capitalist principles personal property is not the same as private property personally property includes your body your housecar private property is used to produce wealth through private ownership things you buy produce and sell are your personal property and you can do whatever you want with it you shouldnt take people seriously when they say a society is a mix of socialism or capitalism or advocate for such a thing as that doesnt make any sense what people mean by this is a regulated capitalist economy capitalism markets socialization would mean every citizen has a fair input and share of the product that is provided to them it is where all of society commonly benefit from goods and services produced by it and where a government only answers to the public not the will of elites or a state socialization is organized democratically and is more transparentresponsive to citizen input nationalized industry switches the ownership of a private owner to a state run by private interests many socialist parties have tried to make nationalized industry more democratic communist societies include revolutionary catalonia rojova and the paris commune the ussr and china among others are not examples of socialism or communism since they were just transition states and never achieved socialism they are examples of states that considered themselves socialist or communist for the purpose of achieving socialism marx described in his manifesto the short term solution of nationalizing transportation communication and most essential industries as transition from capitalism to socialism this does not mean a communist society will include these things as it is stateless marx is influential in the sense that his ideas of socializing certain industries for the sake of the people led to the social democratic parties developing the famous welfare states the scandinavian models are welfare states with capitalist economies there is no socialism here except for marxist influences within the social democratic parties many of the views held by social democrats can be inline with most socialistscommunists but the economies of those countries is not socialism anarchism is not a society without order but one without a state concepts like federalism and confederalism are popular among anarchists famous examples also include catalonia and todays rajova anarchist societies simply see the state and capitalism as oppressive and reject these hierarchal relationships dont confuse communists and socialists for being against democracy because a few transition states claimed to be communistsocialist the dprk claims to be democratic yet we clearly dont consider them any sort of democracy people abuse the no true scotsman fallacy if they claim communists use it to say that the ussr and china werent arent communist this is an abuse of a generally helpful logical fallacy that can otherwise be used to organize arguments if you know the history kindly explain it to them so they will understand please be informed of these before continuing an argument it makes a lot of arguments shorter and less riddled with misconceptions cheers
SubredditDrama,removed,that op is legit a god i found myself upvoting everyone of their comments
SubredditDrama,removed,uangrydm youre getting talked about a lot in here due to your antics speak in your defence or forever hold ye peace
SubredditDrama,removed,damn that guy really is the stereotype of the autistic redditor living in a fantasy world
SubredditDrama,removed,is that the dude who shamed his girlfriend for wearing purple and green socks that reminded him of the gg mascot
SubredditDrama,removed,harassing
SubredditDrama,removed,my biggest problem with this is just that its colin kaepernick who is doing this i dont mind lebron or chris paul or people who actually grew up in the black community protesting mistreatment they lived it they know it they can speak for it but colin kaepernick who was adopted into an affluent white family and lived a charmed life playing multiple sports all through his lifehe has no soapbox to stand on reminds me of one of those fedora wearing white neckbeards at berkley protesting racial oppression you have no right to do this kaep you disrespect the white family that gave you a privileged life that allows you to make millions of dollars in the nfl i dont want to be lectured on racial inequality from a pampered brat this just posses me the fuck off really tempted to puss in the popcorn right now to tell this idiot to fuck off but i wont
SubredditDrama,removed,you know i get downvoted for speaking the unpopular truth so your attempts as defamation dont stick sorry there is no xx male syndrome that is made the fuck up ive studied enough genetics to know here you go shill
SubredditDrama,removed,so how about we meet somewhere in the middle ya think instead of just shitting on him also fuck off about that romney republican shit
SubredditDrama,removed,how dare a rich black guy talk about racism the only people who really know what its like to be a black man in america are the privileged boys of reddit on another note as a sports fan i still see a strong undercurrent of shut up and dance monkey were paying you its very apparent in that shit show of a thread
SubredditDrama,removed,so when folks like colin point out how horrible it can be for minorities it pisses white people off its not that white people get pissed off at how horrible it can be for minorities it is that black people minorities are constantly complaining about how hard they have it when immigrants who literally escape genocide set up successful businesses send their children to college etc i know a very successful rwandan that owns a dollar store and cambodian family that owns a donut shop respectively even they are sick and tired at how entitled black people minorities have become asking themselves if we can escape literal genocide and still do well then what is stopping them
SubredditDrama,removed,to take a couple of examples but its not a couple of examples african immigrants are why doesnt the invisible magic hand of white supremacy affect them why dont they blame everything on their misfortunes as blackfolk torch their neighbourhoods and call up al sharpton anecdotally speaking every real african i know doesnt really like african americans all too much seeing them as lazy and entitledits safe to say that all of my black friends tend to be african not africanamerican sometimes it isnt a matter of working harder and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps its an impossibility absolute rubbish this is still the land of opportunity freely available to anyone who wants it which is why hundreds of thousands of immigrants myself included practically fought tooth and nail to get here it literally seems like every immigrant group mexicans and central americans included is far more successful educated and less prone to chronic whinging than africanamericans
SubredditDrama,removed,im not going to respond to what youve written ownd
SubredditDrama,removed,i think rnfl took it rather well except for a couple of obvious racist white supremacists alt right proponents much better than most of reddit would
SubredditDrama,removed,is it popcorn pissing if you sub to nfl already
SubredditDrama,removed,there are a lot of people here that dont get it capitalism is a proven failure and you can see that just by looking at what america has become income inequality where the richest who horde their money and need it the least are thriving while the poorest who need a hand up and not a kick down are struggling with no health care no education no food and one pay check away from homelessness part of smashingthepatriarchy is smashing the exploitive capitalist system
SubredditDrama,removed,you know society is going downhill when they wont even let me call little kids nigger on xbox live anymore
SubredditDrama,removed,what
SubredditDrama,removed,communism isnt a proven failure by any means and you are one of these people that simply dont get it communism has failed or so the common observation goes more often one hears the opinion that the soviet union failed or that the communist countries of eastern europe did so as well but what does failure mean here usually it simply means that they came to an end even that they were not eternal dig deeper and the failure is marked by a host of items dictatorship and totalitarianism rather than democracy and freedom the sad reality that was far from the perfect dream the fragmentation that arose instead of the voluntary union of working people from many ethnic and religious backgrounds state capitalism instead of communism and simple betrayal of revolutionary marxism my answer in the face of this persistent propaganda is that they did not fail and that communisms – plural – as such have not failed to be sure they had and continue to have many problems for they are not perfect by any means but this is not failure in order to deal with the various caricatures of failure let us travel to various parts of the world both postcommunist and still communist
SubredditDrama,removed,again youre not getting it i encourage you to do some research for yourself rather than parroting extremist whitewing super libertarian talking points
SubredditDrama,removed,you realize just because the laws are gone that minoritys are still being oppressed right bbut muh white racism
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont do that either but thanks for assuming you prick wow you have some growing to do good bye d d d d this smugness has me so jaded
SubredditDrama,removed,everybody knows youre a fuckin pokemon scammer fag
SubredditDrama,removed,thats a false equivalence though
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck this you assholes cant even follow redditquette and are downvoting me for having a fucking discussion capitalist cowards im not going to wait minutes per reply just to educate some edgelord white wing extremist high schoolers that libertarianism is a failed ideology and furthering the goals of exploitation of labor is killing americans through a lack of food access education access healthcare access ect ect ect
SubredditDrama,removed,also til korea is a white a country i love when the edgelord whitewing extremists have to draw false equivalence fallacies to make a case what are you even talking about anyway
SubredditDrama,removed,heres a good idea mute the people like a normal pussy
SubredditDrama,removed,im proud to be a brother in christ with you its soooooo hard to not give in to the hedonistic dowhatyoufeel mentality of today my body wants to have sex and eat pizza all day my body wants to be angry when someone cuts me off or calls me names my body wants be selfish and cruel and heartless but i choose not to and i always try to defer to god to fight these urges ugh this enrages me more than any other christian talking point i have it just as hard as you because sometimes i want to eat lots of pizza and thats a sin too lol they demand that we remain celibate unhappy and fearful for our whole lives and then they talk about it like its completely trivial i hate ratheism as much as any other thinking redditor jk theres no such thing but this stuff makes me start fantasizing about going on some kind of reverse crusade
SubredditDrama,removed,because its profitable is absolutely one of the most repeated phrases on rgames and its just a fucking transparent claim that were supposed to tolerate bad behavior because money so stop discussing because nuance and notimmediate gratification is super hard
SubredditDrama,removed,some nerds think that this should be a place to ask stupid fucking questions about bullshit that you are too scared to ask a messenger in real life because someone like uoceanofblood might take his chain lock off and spin it right in your fucking face ive been sitting here for ten minutes wondering what bikemessenging related question could also be taken as a mortal insult
SubredditDrama,removed,time for the sjw in me im a huge sports fan but i can never get over how a professional baseball team can have such a blatantly ridiculous and racist logo in this day and age like the more you look at it the worse it gets its just so awful thats gotta change soon no

SubredditDrama,removed,oh no hurt feelings
SubredditDrama,removed,and then little suzy realized she was actually a right wing extremist
SubredditDrama,removed,brianna wu is already remodded thats why he looks like a tranny
SubredditDrama,removed,figure out how to calculate complex variable interest rate payments they quite literally tell you what the monthly payments are you dont have to calculate squat oh by the way this low interest rate we lured you in with only applies to the first three payments clause buried on page ten subparagraph two you know that little asterisks literally right after the price maybe it matters and maybe its clearly laid out in the contract youre signing in times size sorry literacy is required to sign contracts just because these retards arent more literate than a ukrainian peasant woman from the early and cant budget beyond hurr durr i want a new tv and the latest iphone while working at walmart isnt my problem
SubredditDrama,removed,ah yes the ultimate authority on who got hacked when
SubredditDrama,removed,ohmygod youre so fucking dumb

SubredditDrama,removed,better pull themselves up by the boot straps right yeah let them keep trying their own strategy until they realize it doesnt fucking work theyll only be a century behind the rest of us horse and sparrow economics has been known as a hoax for a long fucking time that doesnt stop them from sticking their heads in the sand they want help they vote against it and then blame the people offering it that theyre being ignored but hey you feel superior and get to tell them told you so at the cost of trump being president if i was white id be a lot more enthusiastic about the idea of trump accomplishing basically nothing for the bloc of voters that put him in office those jobs they want back arent coming back and trump isnt going to put in any safety nets to help them deal with the loss so they are just as fucked as everyone else but im not white so instead of enjoying that i get to be afraid that bigots are going to think its ok to be openly hostile again fantastic fuck me for not wanting to appease people that crave the days of america where they can call people niggers and spics and everyone just has a giggle
SubredditDrama,removed,did the left discourage you or spurn you on discourage of course only since last night have i thought my people might still have a future in this country settle into your victory and enjoy it no plans to fam this is just the end of the beginning
SubredditDrama,removed,in that case though why do working class white people take offense to the concept of white privilege do working class white people take offense to the concept of white privilege oh please tell me what privilege i had growing up in a rural fucking fishing town a dying industry with a junkie parent and a sick mother tell me how poverty was easier for me because i was white in a white area tell me how fucking easy life is because of my pigment you god damn racist piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,you do realize even poor black people are sick of your shit right white privilege isnt real where im from go fuck yourself
SubredditDrama,removed,i fucking live there you dumb piece of shit and we talk about things all the fucking time none of it is about how god damn fucking privileged i am because they know me and they know people like you are doing the opposite to help even though you gloat about how fucking helpful you are everyone including non white people are sick of your shit

SubredditDrama,removed,yup sure thing op isnt the only fucking person honestly you seem like such a sheltered asshole its probably entirely pointless to even bother reasoning with you i just really hope one day you realize youre doing the opposite of being helpful
SubredditDrama,removed,yes he does exist many people exist you cant pick and choose who deserves what based on your own personal fucking opinions youre just another racist bigoted asshole the only difference between the racist red necks and you is that you think youre better than them
SubredditDrama,removed,so if hillary had won youd be okay with some of the people here blaming niggers
SubredditDrama,removed,seriously youre going to make me quote you white privilege is a thing that exists you may not like it but it does if were going to treat poor whites like equals they need to pay it forward you absolutely dont get it do you youre saying poor white people should suffer because other people did in the past you see nothing wrong with that mentality innocent people should suffer because youre not suffering because its easy for you to say things like that while its not impacting your life what the fuck is wrong with you

SubredditDrama,removed,yeah thats not even remotely close to poor white should suffer see do you know what really enrages me beyond all else its when donald trump goes to the smoking ruins of a gay nightclub in orlando and talks about how hes totally prolgbt because hes going to kill all the muslims then turns around and starts talking about how awesome antigay rights groups are its when people who routinely hang out at rtheredpill talk about how much better they are then those evil misogynist syrian immigrants its hypocrisy that pisses me off more than anything else in the world all im asking is please dont be a hypocrite if you want to be treated as equals then please please please be willing to treat others as equals yourself give them the same consideration we give you thats all were asking yeah see ive tried to reason with you but youre still using me as a personal sounding board you refuse to listen you dont even give a shit or pretend to all im asking is please grow the fuck up and realize problems exist outside your own and you have no idea what other people go through because instead of asking them youre condemning them for the same reasons you want people to be protected equals youve already established youre better than rural hicks that ship has sailed you flaming bigot
SubredditDrama,removed,i want you to put an honest effort in removing your head from your ass thats all
SubredditDrama,removed,what do you say to the blacks and latinos and gays and women who voted for trump wow way to turn this around and blame minorities as a south african ive realized that white people are the same the world over bigoted persecution complex ass turds fuck white people
SubredditDrama,removed,completely legitimate just like being a transexual isnt a mental disorder
SubredditDrama,removed,oh youre angry racism totally doesnt count if it was angry racism
SubredditDrama,removed,all of the racism this election has come from the left its gone well beyond infantilizing minorities and now theyre openly hateful towards white people especially white men
SubredditDrama,removed,you live in fucking boston you attention seeking loser no one is going to murder you in your moms basement
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah im agreeing with you
SubredditDrama,removed,typical srd tween
SubredditDrama,removed,its not my fault some people are psychos that let other men stick their penises in them
SubredditDrama,removed,i have loved every minute of it mostly because of reactions like yours i generally cant stand the republicans but i really hate liberals because of people like you and the reaction ive seen on reddit like a bunch of spoiled children that didnt get their way so they start hurling insults ive supported obama over the last years because i am an american thats what we do we support the president and question them if we feel like theyve made a mistake its funny because the people i see whining about racism and bigotry are racists and bigots their word carries no weight and they are exactly why hillary lost the election wanna win over independents in years stop driving a gap between potential voters and your party or keep doing what you do and youll get this result
SubredditDrama,removed,ahahaha you definitely baited these guys badly theyre taking this like the right took you gotta be gentle with them for like a month easily
SubredditDrama,removed,how those people being called niggers and sandpeople do they not get sick and tired as well
SubredditDrama,removed,its funny because they can say black and latinos didnt vote even though i sure as hell did but if you say fuck white people clearly youre talking about all of them are you a fucking moron or do you not understand how those are two different statements
SubredditDrama,removed,and yet what my goal was to get a third party in the debates you fucking retarded bro you cant read
SubredditDrama,removed,how so at least in this thread youre not insulting peoplei guess your bravado really is a pretense i feel a persons is a useful heuristic for evaluating their usefulness as source of knowledge you sad sweaty little man
SubredditDrama,removed,anyway it looks like the pretense of civility didnt last longyour are much too emotional about this to pursue this charade of yours everyone you talk to on reddit will know about this you need to be insulted do you understand being civil to you would be like feeding candy to an overweight child
SubredditDrama,removed,you should check out in rjustneckbeardthings or rcringeanarchy how autistic men spend on it is amazing to see them buying creepy stuff
SubredditDrama,removed,that is one of the worst subreddits to have ever existed id rather coontown than that genocide of humor
SubredditDrama,removed,autism has never been or ever will be an excuse for being a dickhead explain then
SubredditDrama,removed,you wouldnt know about bank regulation if it hit you in your face i actually work in investment banking you dont know a damn thing beyond what you read on mother jones
SubredditDrama,removed,i am gonna have to agree with his attitude people gobbling up black culture while trying to imprison it im also going to be rolling my eyes at white women over a certain age listening to beyoncé the whole what about the thing is a bit of a head scratcher like a means something has support reddit calls that margin vote fuzzing
SubredditDrama,removed,im right there with him im not sure why i need to empathize with and give the benefit of the doubt to a man who wants to bring back stop and frisk and reverse gay marriage rights or the ignorant people who voted for him
SubredditDrama,removed,i voted trump because im in cali and was afforded a protest vote clinton is also a racist and a lying cheating piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,repeating yourself over and over isnt gonna make anyone take your side youre a real piece of shit dude
SubredditDrama,removed,screw you not everyone wants to be stalked by a fucking nazi
SubredditDrama,removed,screw off
SubredditDrama,removed,stating a differing opinion of yours isnt against the rules yet is it
SubredditDrama,removed,oxus things your comment is flamebait but a comment that says clinton is also a racist and a lying cheating piece of shit is just fine lol
SubredditDrama,removed,it was not deleted until at best right before i mentioned it and you deleted a ton of way less egregious comments before that
SubredditDrama,removed,m e l t e l t
SubredditDrama,removed,thats maru bruh
SubredditDrama,removed,the part about being an underrated book did it for me
SubredditDrama,removed,cnn has now projected that trump will win the popular vote so there goes that talking point
SubredditDrama,removed,you dont get the concept of people not having enough money to pay at once good riddance you piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,more questions answered than obama suck it nerds
SubredditDrama,removed,top post on rall at this very moment is stickied at thedonald you dipshit but please tell us more how that doesnt appear there
SubredditDrama,removed,are you literally defending donald trump right now mods ban this garbage
SubredditDrama,removed,lol this fuckin subredditfiltered you faggots
SubredditDrama,removed,wtf youre kidding right i am thanking god right now that trumps ama was deleted omg
SubredditDrama,removed,their only visible gay dude is a self hating asshole who calls himself a based faggot i take exception to that completely unfair characterization of milo he is a probably sane but shameless individual who is cynically exploiting the rampant stupidity plaguing american conservatism for his own financial benefit he follows a proud lines of coulters limbaughs and hannitys people who keep their actual beliefs private lest they lose potential customers i demand an apology
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry lol i get pretty heated and active im an activist when i see uninformed people defending trump you should watch some john oliver hell tell you trump is wrong hes really funny too used to be a cohost on the daily show
SubredditDrama,removed,shhh
SubredditDrama,removed,is your username a reference to bro rape
SubredditDrama,removed,i like that milo calls himself a faggot a lot it means i can call gay people faggots and they cant accuse me of being homophobic because milo is gay and i like milo xdddddd
SubredditDrama,removed,they wont break it down that seems like a job
SubredditDrama,removed,you gotta love how the other extreme side of retards will hate on nasa just because trump kinda said he likes them to pander to his own audience usa fucking rules in space exploration we dont just dilly dab our dicks in orbit with faggot satellites we go literally above and beyond but correct me when those other countrys moon landings and mars rovers and deep space satellites come out of the shadows
SubredditDrama,removed,i cant imagine youre too retarded to know the difference between intentionally killing innocents and accidents so ill assume youre just making a shitty arguement for the sake of it
SubredditDrama,removed,
SubredditDrama,removed,because in a post about a girl having a life changing surgery hes posting about deceiving future mates like a socially retarded le stem lord
SubredditDrama,removed,wow what an incredible detective you are you found me out retard
SubredditDrama,removed,he doesnt have a twitter account anymore so theres nothing to stop you from reading other peoples articles about it other than your own cowardice selfdenialism and knowledge that he really didnt do it
SubredditDrama,removed,you are brainwashed
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess censorship is fine because its their website ok youre a fucking idiot congratulations
SubredditDrama,removed,i love that uthemodelredditor is being interviewed by an actual journalist but is still talking like a year old if i were being interviewed there is no way in hell if use words like left wing trolls or a phrase like theyre coming to brigade us because how in the world am i supposed to read that and not laugh my ass off at how childish that all seems
SubredditDrama,removed,the exact same demographic who blows shit up and attacks us in the street no thanks ill avoid them all its literally smart to people have to help themselves pal there are no free handouts in this world im not asking for any either only safety and opportunities
SubredditDrama,removed,not every muslim is a terrorist but all terrorist are muslims have you not made the connection that muslims are the fucking problem yet no shit not all of them but too many of them are dumb fuck
SubredditDrama,removed,pretty low bar for horrible
SubredditDrama,removed,theres more tests after the bar to become an attorney my gf is gonna freak out if she doesnt already know this lol
SubredditDrama,removed,well she wont find out til november if she actually passed but thank you
SubredditDrama,removed,hopefully and ya its torturous dude these people have to wait months to find out and if they find out they failed they better start studying again swap cus the next bar exam takes place in february
SubredditDrama,removed,does chuck lorre count as a celebrity i think hes the only celeb i want to fail
SubredditDrama,removed,nah i kinda think ethics as a whole is kind of a silly study but i dont see how im getting down voted for saying literally murdering someone is worse than being homophobic lol
SubredditDrama,removed,racist fuckwad
SubredditDrama,removed,no one else thinks she is a vain human being for getting unnecessary surgery just to be cute her parents spend thousands of dollars just so her daughter can date the high school school quarterback meanwhile millions of citizens in the us have no access to jobs or lifesaving healthcare what a fucked up world
SubredditDrama,removed,ujumbledone you really took that dude for a ride kudos im so glad he kept responding
SubredditDrama,removed,if i was a girl mansplaining about to commence
SubredditDrama,removed,lmaoooo i hurt this dudes feelings so he banned my acc from rtifu lmao on to the next one
SubredditDrama,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,removed,message upreggit directly he likes it better than modmail
SubredditDrama,removed,well i would say the paranoia is pretty well warranted when people are being directly funded by a democratic poc to spam social media
SubredditDrama,removed,not unless they allow obama to have a term
SubredditDrama,removed,keep kicking the bernie supporters while they are down that will work out really well for you
SubredditDrama,removed,eew no
SubredditDrama,removed,youre a child who cant accept that its not the end of the world for people to have different opinions no instead you gotta keep making irrelevant comments as if i give a good goddam whether you share my opinion my comment is not untrue you ignorant toddler it just happens to be different from yours no for fucks sake move on jfc
SubredditDrama,removed,oh fuck off
SubredditDrama,removed,you are a fucking piece of shit how anyone can support this brutality towards the innocent is beyond my fucking expectations
SubredditDrama,removed,you remind me of the phrase he who fights monsters eventually turns into a whiny idiot justifying killing kids by saying theyre worse
SubredditDrama,removed,to answer your question there is so little value in human life because humans are a disgusting species the sole species we know that taught itself greed and cruelty we slaughter each other for profit over ideals and out of pure bloodlust thats why many view it as so low and at least for me its true that if we fail to liberate humankind we should bring it at least salvation if this is how you bring salvation to humanity start with your own salvation fucking tankie trash thankfully this piece of shit still has a few more years of school so theyll hopefully have time to grow up and learn how to be a communist without masturbating to the murder of kids in cold blood
SubredditDrama,removed,you are a depraved lunatic you advocate murder for the greater good and that makes you just as bad as a fascist
SubredditDrama,removed,take your rationalisations and shove it fam youre not clever or witty enough to pull it off without being a douche canoe
SubredditDrama,removed,i think youve gone rfullretard
SubredditDrama,removed,come on dude child murder can be funny
SubredditDrama,removed,bro you should never go full retard
SubredditDrama,removed,my post history is awash in faggotry and unabashed sjwness i apologize profusely for you having to go through that
SubredditDrama,removed,i wonder where in the venn diagram this dude falls between libertarians bitching about laws violence and mras bitching about not having access to fatherhood stuff
SubredditDrama,removed,i know why you think that but i am also confident than i am wrong and that none of you are doing nothing else but contributing to the toxic and hateful attitudes towards overweight people
SubredditDrama,removed,i just got banned from rredditrequest when i interacted with this user hes a piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,well he was black thats good enough for any jury
SubredditDrama,removed,trayvon was a thug
SubredditDrama,removed,i have to say its sad to see the media and the public railroad a brown man who was only only trying to protect his life and his neighborhood
SubredditDrama,removed,reading awful shit like this on reddit is one of the reasons i consider myself a feminist
SubredditDrama,removed,thanks i was thinking how can i contribute to this community and then i saw your little slice of melodrama and the answer was obvious
SubredditDrama,removed,its not he is a dumb nigger
SubredditDrama,removed,do you not know anything about context and history good grief the white fragility in this thread is cringeworthy do you flinch when watching dave chapelles comedy too
SubredditDrama,removed,reddit has certainly made me see that the average college aged dude is a piece of shit when it comes to women
SubredditDrama,removed,both sides do reddittxt
SubredditDrama,removed,women definitely get away with a lot more stuff in relationships than men do but some fragile female egos here are never going to admit that seen this happen multiple times to friends where their gf keeps him on a leash but ofcourse they themselves can go out whenever they want never seen the situation happen with genders reversed
SubredditDrama,removed,i mean when whiny feminist women have been bringing up falsified stats for so long to claim they are horribly oppressed and shout down men bringing up any issues because they are privileged can you honestly be surprised some men start responding with stats of their own
SubredditDrama,removed,sometimes all a woman needs is a good beat down to fix her issues reddit
SubredditDrama,removed,because securing it so i have someplace to stay why dont you just go to a domestic violence shelter
SubredditDrama,removed,yea im sure racism is the only reason you could vote leave sis you are american arent you
SubredditDrama,removed,that there is womens work
SubredditDrama,removed,ittthe relationships bitches continue their slapfight here
SubredditDrama,removed,im really shocked at how many of these blatant misogynist statements are being upvoted scary
SubredditDrama,removed,short for nigger
SubredditDrama,removed,not really i was just pointing out a bit of a flaw in your logic not trying to debate you or be caustic but good job being a bitch to someone trying to give constructive criticism to your post
SubredditDrama,removed,you know blizzard actually uses the exact same reasoning as to why they never restore characters killed in hardcore mode in diablo and while it definitely sucks to lose a character to latency issues that are completely out of your control you go into it knowing the risks and you have to be able to deal with that while this case is different in that the user likely didnt know that dying in lms would have those consequences i cant help but side with jagex on this one umodmatk should definitely have just stopped after that first paragraph though
SubredditDrama,removed,youre right i should have put educated people of color forgot about uncle toms and such
SubredditDrama,removed,what a horrible smug bastard you are
SubredditDrama,removed,i think its one of those invisible some people have them its like having invisible friends or parents its a phase some people have to get over
SubredditDrama,removed,i fucking love it i know ill get downvoted here but you still havent provided anything its like listening to a conspiracy theorist argue his point google is sheeple was obviously a hoax bruh its so obvious im not gonna argue with you just google it
SubredditDrama,removed,then be a bitch and have no one like you ever
SubredditDrama,removed,oh honey i know it has my evidence your very comment your very reply right here to me that im responding to right now you are scolding me for having a different opinion than the most holy noble feminism and for that i should be punished we arent allowed to have differing opinions and think for ourselves because of feminists and people like you who defend them
SubredditDrama,removed,before wave feminism we were then these harpies came along and told us how to think how to act and that if we werent feminists we hated ourselves and other women also way to miss the point of what im talking about
SubredditDrama,removed,ah there it is more deflection on top of random insults good work youre extremely progressive
SubredditDrama,removed,he was permabanned next
SubredditDrama,removed,i dont understand why people think this is so weird this is just general logic
SubredditDrama,removed,oh honey you think you understand women but the women i know dont understand what feminism is and the feminists i understand dont know who women are
SubredditDrama,removed,a trumpette or republican lying no fucking way
SubredditDrama,removed,im a bot bleep bloop
SubredditDrama,removed,children of slavers grow up to be slavers sure they didnt yet understand what their parents were up to but the overwhelming odds are they would have become complicit in it you can call it collateral damage i think of it as excising a tumor before it metastasizes
SubredditDrama,removed,dont worry i extracted two drops from that bucket of cyanide theres less now
SubredditDrama,removed,trp truecels uncensorednews whatever bixnood mensrights kotakuinaction etc
SubredditDrama,removed,ya i mean who cares if youre supplying a recruiting ground for racists fascists and other bigots its such a small section of the website the cat pics make up for it
SubredditDrama,removed,uh
SubredditDrama,removed,if you cant see the rampant misogyny on the first page of those subs without it being pointed out im not going to waste my breath on explaining it figure it out on your own
SubredditDrama,removed,just like most people on thedonald
SubredditDrama,removed,new season is shit new threads in rfuckpearl daily
SubredditDrama,removed,lets see srd trip over themselves to prove who is the most progressive and match beginsnow ding ding ding
SubredditDrama,removed,sure i have because disagreeing with you automatically makes me a troll great logic there nigger
SubredditDrama,removed,ungtstkr the guy whos arguing against everyone isnt even arguing that is the most common schedule which was the point of that thread hes saying jobs exist not on a schedule which everyone already agrees with they arent even arguing about the same thing lol
SubredditDrama,removed,misogynistic shitpires are all garbage some stack that garbage higher
SubredditDrama,removed,sorry few things annoy me more than boy who called wolf syndrome both because it weakens the gravity of the wolf and that its used extremely opportunistically in the guise of some moral high ground
SubredditDrama,removed,when people assume that you wouldnt like sports or that my favorite genre of music is classical sounds horrific what a burden what world have we created when everyones minor fucking annoyances count as some type of oppression go to a fucking war or something because that you just complained about this shit is laughable id like to talk to you about gift but instead youre going to complain about fucking phineas and ferb my fucking god
SubredditDrama,removed,the sentiment that you cant be racist towards asians or that this is somehow okay is mindmindbogglingly widespread here ill break it down for you redditors really really really want to be racist
SubredditDrama,removed,yeah that entirely changes uherovillainous argument and makes him look disingenuous as fuck chink in the armor isnt a racist figure of speech and to imply it is like he said lebron was a nigger is just fucking dumb at best

SubredditDrama,removed,im pretty sure youre a psychopath
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck you this isnt some word that was made explicitly for hate it was a word to describe a protoeuropean people who had a significant impact on history just becsuse you get your panties in a knot over it doesnt mean we should stop using it people like hitler win when a once simple word fills people with anger
SubredditDrama,removed,go back to your safe space you little shit
SubredditDrama,removed,ahh yes because proto indoeuropean just rolls off the tounge im not letting nazis or little politically correct asshats like you bring hatred and disgust to a name of a group of people who had no choice in becoming a symbol
SubredditDrama,removed,well blogs are fantastic and everything and being an expert must be fun but your guess was just way off so i dont know what i can say except for no it wasnt the spot you were thinking of i dont really understand what goes on in a persons head to make them so angry about someone guessing the wrong location for a ramen shop
SubredditDrama,removed,anarcho capitalism or libertarianism hard mode is the political ideology you adopt if you have the empathy and intellectual capacity of a literal toddler your life has spiraled completely out of control if youre a fully grown adult and think anarcho capitalism is a viable path towards an earth worth existing on

SubredditDrama,removed,what a sad life it must be to be a gamergater
SubredditDrama,removed,more than one person tried to argue with me that it was ok to shoot children after i said shooting people was bad on a gun control thread the other week its insane

SubredditDrama,removed,it was clearly a joke understood by everyone except you you sure you havent been tested for autism yet
SubredditDrama,removed,making white dudes feel uncomfortable is the worst of all crimes thats why youre the actual racistsexist
SubredditDrama,removed,but you are literally arguing that we should tone down our words or at least one specific word because it might bother boys arent internet feminists also the ones who want people to stop using terms like bitching because it might bother some women were going to tell you to stop using words that bother us and then were going to start using words that bother you fucking hypocrisy also it kind of is feminist rhetoric not academically but colloquially lol if mansplaining is considered feminist rhetoric by anybody then that just goes to show how far the movement has fallen it sounds like something a grader would come up with its just fucking stupid and immature it has no place in any discussion and the moment i see somebody say it seriously thats how i know they have nothing of value to say and are not to be taken seriously
SubredditDrama,removed,fuck every single trump supporter
SubredditDrama,removed,how to deny that your political candidate is largely supported by white supremacists actual full on nazis and other racist fuckwits part thats all rthedonald is now a bunch of racists trying to dissuade other racists from being openly racist

SubredditDrama,removed,do these women spend their time actively searching for shit to be offended about fucking shit we cant even explain things anymore without obtaining a written consent form first for a group that is so against using gendered slurs ther sure dont seem to have a problem throwing that one around with impunity
SubredditDrama,removed,its sad how one of the biggest subreddits is a den for extremely biased monkeys who cant possibly comprehend that hillary won and bernie lost
SubredditDrama,removed,i guess thats just what helicopter parenting does to people
SubredditDrama,removed,i dunno this one seems pretty bad
SubredditDrama,removed,your posts reek of correct the record
SubredditDrama,removed,that sub seems like a shithole
SubredditDrama,removed,on reddit anything less than chaining women up in the kitchen and mass rapes isnt misogyny s

SubredditDrama,removed,you and i have most likely both had experiences with black people and i guarantee of them have been good theyre fine functioning members of society you have most likely not had any experience with gypsies in your life every single romanian and bulgarian you will ever talk to will say they are awful and they wish they never came to their countries its very easy to say noooo theyre just normal people like us let them do what they want they deserve to be treated just like everyone else who worked for their respect when youre off in some country on your high horse looking down at eastern europe and all the other countries with gypsy problems their culture is pure trash dont try to sjw and tell me i should learn to appreciate subhumans who dont shower and pride themselves in stealing and begging any other culture on earth including wherever youre from would laugh at the idea of someone being proud to be a piece of shit
SubredditDrama,removed,im sorry but black people actually have jobs and are respected in the us gypsies dont shower and steal the south has no black people problems they have mindless racists mindless in the sense that the black people in the us do not deserve what they get gypsies absolutely do you keep using the same argument about how im racist because if you changed what i said it would make me racist thats pretty funny cause im not saying blacks are bad im saying gypsies are bad when i say everything i say about gypsies its correct when you change it to black people its wrong what a coincidence heres an example for your defensive brain i dont like hotdogs my people have had problems with hotdogs for ages bun to meat ratio is bad they dont even try and most of all some of them really do taste like shit elsewhere in the world there are people who dont like hamburgers hamburgers get hate from these other people but theres no legitimate reason behind it the autistic shit youre doing is quoting my dislike towards hotdogs and then just swapping the words with hambugers like that makes sense stop defending subhumans

SubredditDrama,removed,i personally think its biggest flaw is the strong influence of racists specifically white supremacist organizations but i can see your point of view
SubredditDrama,removed,anyway do you have a foreskin
SubredditDrama,removed,people who pretend to be a minority in order to defend their bigotry deserve to have something unpleasant happen to them
SubredditDrama,removed,admins actively protecting thedonald now looking more and more like the admins are vaguely aok with sexists racists homophobes and etc as long as theyre not the ones being targeted and the neonazis bring in more adrevenue

SubredditDrama,removed,thats not any different than the left trying to push their views its not wrong for either side to push what they believe in you cant blame someone for wanting to convince people that their side is right
SubredditDrama,removed,are you fucking stupid you do realize that a subreddit is not public property right i cant protest in your fucking living room for the same reason
SubredditDrama,removed,the vivvav guy realized that will be his crowning achievement so hes trying to rule with an iron fist because he knows his life will never get better than to be a mod there
SubredditDrama,removed,so reddit users sharing their opinions on a variety of subreddits is apparently bad only people with the right opinion are allowed to freely state their opinions
SubredditDrama,removed,you are quite thick arent you do you not understand the concept of private property you do not own the servers that reddit maintains they can bar you from using their servers for any reasons they dont even have to follow their own terms of service you have zero right to post or comment on reddit just as i have zero right to say spray paint on the front of your home cautiona utter moron lives here it would not matter that my statement is factually correct your unwillingness to let me spray paint this on your home would not be infringing on my free speech my constitutional rights do not supersede your rights just because you are an idiot
SubredditDrama,removed,im a straight male but have you seen benedict cumberbatch unfortunatelly even the hardcore lesbians and the crazy homophobes are at least a bit bisexual lamping hardcore lesbians with homophobes saying that lesbians like men gilded and upvotes lol twoxchromoses you waste of space id rather hang out rdonald

SubredditDrama,removed,you mean the decision to be congress to the suffering of millions of sentient and conscious creatures for human selfishness sure what a perfectly acceptable decision

SubredditDrama,removed,fallacy fallacy
SubredditDrama,removed,theres no such thing as rape culture in western countries the leading rape support and poltical advocacy groups specifically said american rape culture is a myth and were lambasted by feminists gun culture yes bad thing thats up for debate and not my area of expertise i will say my understanding is that nearly all violent crime is committed with illegally owned firearms often supplied by the cartels so if that is the case im unsure was stricter licencing would achieve but again im not an expert on gun control so i may not understand the issues in america concerning it
SubredditDrama,removed,just look at the world wars civil war white men wage war on catastrophic scales tribal skirmishes amount to puddles of nigger blood compared to the ocean of white mans suffering

SubredditDrama,removed,you sound like a whiny loser maybe if you didnt hate yourself you wouldnt have to down vote on principle
SubredditDrama,removed,funny how liberals never have to explain anything its should just be self evident how right and intelligent they are are about everything
SubredditDrama,removed,shaming fatties is always good for everyone

SubredditDrama,removed,but say one thing about reddit and they will fuck you up yeah theyll fuck you up about points and three gildings redditeurs lurve the sarcastic upvote
SubredditDrama,removed,i didnt say such a thing i only said religious minorities are not free in many muslim countries thats hard to deny i never said anything about the west at all youre trying to deny that minorities are often mistreated in muslim countries because you want to be pc
SubredditDrama,removed,which seems unrealistic because for that to happen you would need to be outside
SubredditDrama,not_removed,elsewhere in the thread youre wasting a lot of man hours heh man hours
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know if its just reddit ask men or that thread but i had no idea so many people think that if your end goal is a monogamous partnership you cant go on dates with different people while youre looking for the one you like enough to date exclusively am i out to lunch or is this not a completely valid and common dating method
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you sound so confused stop doing everything i expected more bluster and less sass
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id just like to point out what the read the comments its pretty clear theres some double standard going on here though im not quite sure where people are drawing the line
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i found some surplus cucktrump related drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey zachums thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because there is not enough drama to merit an srd submission please wait and see if things develop further or look for a subthread with more drama make sure youre linking with the proper context for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh dear lord they think tinder and want a monogamous relationship are incompatible smdh never go to reddit for dating advice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,women get minutes for every minute man hour
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its that people are seeing dating as always implying theyve already got to the exclusivity part so they think shes leading everyone to think that but then going behind their back because this is all through tinder and theyre all apparently still active i dont think thats whats actually happening its more likely that theyre doing the same thing and noone is assuming exclusivity personally if someone says theyre dating someone i would assume its exclusive unless they say otherwise i wouldnt have picked that word to describe what shes doing but idk a good replacement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,something like a third of am are virgins so theyre not representative of offline populations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,different people have different experiences and social values personally i dont date multiple people at the same time if im going out with someone i wont ask a second person until ive ended things that person and if a second person asks i tell them i already have a date and cant go out until the prior situation clears up anything else just feels morally wrong and im not even particularly wed to the idea of monogamy i just feel guilty if im out with someone else and wondering what the first person would think if they knew i was going out behind their back because i know that if the situation was reverse i wouldnt enjoy being the unsuspecting third wheel either it doesnt feel good to think that you arent someones focus but instead their backup plan what i mean is if someone said hey sorry i gotta cancel our first date but ive met someone and i think it might be a thing id be dissapointed but understandable if someone said hey sorry i gotta cancel our fifth date because this other dude ive been seeing is better than you id be pissed as all hell
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its hilarious because is the top thread on askmen right now men saying its perfectly justifiable to date multiple women at once
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it depends on who you ask it feels like traditionalists dislike this while the modern zeitgeist is entirely cool with it but in this subreddits case it feels less like traditionalism and more like insecurity that said i do think theres an interesting gray area worth talking about re how long is it acceptable to date someone without full disclosure two dates is imo pretty obviously okay while say a year is pretty obviously not though id suspect anyone with an ounce of self respect would have figured out the exclusivity thing explicitly once theyre far enough along
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah that is what normal people do you also dont want to get over invested in a relationship with someone who might not be as interested in you or in a relationship that ligitamately isnt all that great dating around helps both of these things it can be really easy to fall into a relationship too quickly and settle for something less than ideal if as soon as you go on a date with a person once you cut off all other romantic possibilities back when i was still dating i would continue to date other people until we had the exclusivity conversation or until the relationship reached the point where exclusivity would be presumed though i think explicit conversations regarding this are important hell when i met my spouse i was going on dates with multiple people and wasnt even looking for a serious monagomous relationship at the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont mind as long as they dont all show up at the same time on the same dinner date it becomes extremely hard to calculate who pays for what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it depends on the situation i guess i wouldnt expect some one from tinder or a dating website to be exclusively dating me if i ask them out for a coffee or a drink or even some one i talk to every few days and have been on a real date or two but if it was a friend i know well we go on a real date hiking accompanied by dinner for example i would be disappointed if we continued seeing each other and i found out she was also seeing some one else to me i guess it really depends how close you are to the person if youre texting me from the moment you wake up until you go to bed but youre also doing the same with other guys i think thats a little disingenuous dating is a broad term it could be some one youre seeingtalking too every day but arent ready to dive into a serious relationship or it could be some one you talk too once or twice a week while you figure out if you like them or not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no a date is a wedding vow when you hold hands you are engaged
SubredditDrama,not_removed,speaking as a dude ive never done it but i dont really see anything wrong with it either its not like a few dates with someone gets you dibs on them of course after a certain number of dates id probably want the girl to make a decision so it doesnt feel like either of us are wasting our time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a totally normal thing that askmen seems to have a very hard time with for reasons i do not understand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,imo reddit attracts introverts introverts dont get out much and therefore dont have very many dating opportunities so they cant fathom how someone could have so many options that being monogamous from the getgo doesnt make much sense like why on earth would you say no to someone asking you out on a date just because another person asked you out last week dating multiple people is definitely the norm in my experience and if you go into dating expecting people to just drop everyone else just because you asked them out a few times youre going to end up very upset its not just askmen its common to see on askwomen and relationships
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you had begun dating someone you already knew fairly well its reasonable to assume exclusivity though you should really be discussing it if thats important to you if youre dating as in getting to know someone you just met expecting exclusivity right away is pretty silly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously though zachums this is kinda meek
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you must use ok cupid for all monogamy seeking or maybe craigs list as thats how one guy met his wife but definitely not tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,patriarchy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive started to see talking to more and more like theres this guy ive been talking to seems to mean that youre interested in each other but not actually dating yet i used to just say weve been on some dates or something similar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really was there a survey or something that seems crazy high
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i tell them i already have a date and cant go out until the prior situation clears up not knocking your style but isnt this a bit inefficient like what if the girl of your dreams asked you out are you going to say no because youve been seeing someone thats like okay but youre not that sure about them you dont have to be deceitful about it you could say hey i like you and i see this going somewhere but full disclosure im seeing other people unless you dont want me to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its a difference between what people think going on dates vs dating means i know if someone says theyre dating someone my first guess is that theyre exclusive but thats not an objective definition and its dependent on how it was used where you grew up even people who arent actually traditionalists could be defaulting to traditionalish definitions because of that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for me it depends on how much i see that particular dude and then we talk about it where do you see this going are we exclusive now i dont consider myself exclusive with someone unless we actually talk about it ive gotten into so many arguments about this on reddit for not just assuming exclusivity from the getgo which i think is foolish because its a recipe for getting your heart broken
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know the idea that you go on dates and then establish exclusivity asking to go steady giving them your pin whatever other terms people have used has been around since at least the if you object to that then youre a traditionalist from the days when actual courting was the thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and like sometimes you want to get to know a person for a while before you figure out if you even want anything serious with them or not so then theres no reason you wouldnt do that with multiple people at once just like you can befriend several unrelated people at the same time it seems like people who have a problem with it are the sort of people who only ever ask someone out once they are absolutely sure they want an exclusive relationship with them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah or i think if youre going to sleep with someone you should explicitly tell them you are regularly getting tested and always use condoms etc etc but you do have multiple sex partners just because some people get more emotionally invested after sex and also they should know if they are at a higher risk for std transmission so you should be pretty explicitly transparent in that situation imo otherwise if youre just going on or dates i think its assumed youve recently gone on dates with others
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not even a new thing going steady has been around for what years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right these people need to thicken their skin it can grow into monogamy the woman isnt even sleeping with any of these guys its pretty low stakes at this point i dont think it matters if youve hung out with multiple people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe ill make a post on rinsertionsdiscussion about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah i use the phrase seeing i think my friends use talking to presex and seeing postsex seeing is more vague its like maybe we talked maybe we didnt but we saw each other in the same place at the same time wouldnt call it dating each other yet though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like talking to its broad enough that you can use it generally and its not judgey or loaded the closest thing i had was that people i know talk about tinder dates differently than dates but thats too specific to the app and means hookup more often than something that could eventually become more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,median sex partners is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think so thats the number i recall being mentioned by some of the users there i cant remember the age breakdown
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like what if the girl of your dreams asked you out are you going to say no because youve been seeing someone thats like okay but youre not that sure about them id either say no or id break up with the girl i was seeing dating both at the same time with the intention of comparing them and then eliminating the one that doesnt make the cut seems not only immoral but actually cruel and truthfully id probably say no ive always suscribed to both the notion that one of the principles any decent person should follow is dance with the one that brung ya and a bird in the hand is better than in bush
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people dont have the talk for nothin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when they mean sexual partners i assume they mean ever not active if so not that odd but there sure is a heavy tendency towards those who haventdont have much sex and shouldnt the median actually be or do we not count also i dunno this is probably just a regional thing but i feel like with so many being in college that foo fighters and rhcp shouldnt be so high on that list of favorite music but maybe its just cause i went close to nyc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow the music and book tastes of that group are throwing me off who are these white virgin collegeaged males who love kanye and fantasy books not that i think those interests are mutually exclusive just not at all what i expected haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dating both at the same time with the intention of comparing them and then eliminating the one that doesnt make the cut seems not only immoral but actually cruel idk i dont like intentionally compare the two like theres a checklist i just go with who i like the most which to me is feelings based but that takes time and more dates to figure out i cant decide whether i like someone or not based on one date
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sex partner ever is not the norm at all average nationally in america is but thats over a lifetime
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean kanye is popular in general and so are fantasy books lol seems right on par with the white male in college demographics now i wish askwomen asked those things in our
SubredditDrama,not_removed,literally every basic dude in college likes power and golddigger most of them also like eragon and game of thrones
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you do you im just saying that i personally dont think that way i dont care who i like the most as long as i like them enough maybe theres someone better around the corner but the person i got is good and i think theres more value in being loyal to that person than trying to see if someone else is better what i would prefer though is that when people are seeing multiple people they disclose it instead of assuming that everyone is dating around
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean for a place thats majority college aged men its definitely not a lot but its not entirely unexpected especially when you factor in that people who spend a lot of time online or might answer these polls are less likely to be outgoing i mean thats entirely conjecture but i dont think its totally inaccurate either
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is true i just thought their music taste might be a little more alternativerock rhcp and muse are up there too i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i said it earlier but reddit attracts introverts and in my experience its harder to find people to have sex with if you hate social gatherings all of the dudes i know that have slept with women are all party animals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,taylor swift on there tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not working yet still at school but if i was placed in a workplace environment id imagine it wouldnt be hard to avoid women as you would in a schooling environment especially as someone who is pursuing a career in stem besides women wont approach you unless youre a looking guy anyway and since im not very attractive looking myself i think i dont need to worry about women until marriage this is a lot to unpack but i think it does a great job of explaining everything about this guy this is how we get incels
SubredditDrama,not_removed,being nonreligious myself i always find these threads about the permissibility of disregarding certain religious tenants to be really interesting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see muslims on the news sometimes explaining that not touching women is their way of respecting them i dont know if they really believe that or its just the line the give when theyre asked about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well this all feels very timely with the pence thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh the thing is its virtually impossible to not sin these days when i walk to work i will see ads that im sure is pretty unislamic you cant even be sure that your food is ethical to eat because the supply chain stretches to thousands of kilometers worldwide thats why me and most muslims that i know of just make compromises i can avoid eating pork but i cant avoid shaking hands with people at the end of the day im sure there are bigger issues than touching a nonmahram of the opposite sex reminds me of a joke i once read when i grew up my parents hope that i marry a man from the same race religion and culture now theyre just happy that hes a man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why is every single religious subreddit basically a caricature of its religion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the fact that such a thread stays in the positive shines a really bad light on rislam and the islam in general its hard to believe such a discussion taking place in the century at the moment making my comment the thread is at upvotes this doesnt sound like much but apparently most threads there dont make it beyond upvotes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the film four lions had a scene touching on a similar subject omar is at home on his laptop when his wife comes in and tells him they have a guest the other guy wont come into the room because he says he cant be in the same room as omars wife because shes a woman for the record four lions is a film about a group of british muslims planning a terrorist attack its also a comedy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,islam in a nutshell
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love the comments tot head show the great inconsistencies islam has my imam said this so it must be true well not what the quran says pal this goes for all religions know your faith please so i dont have to correct you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you wanna know how isis recruits white guys not talking about bosnians white dudes with zero connection to islam check out rincels i remember browsing in rincels and this guy made a post about how he hates women and wants to enslave them heres a post praising islam for fighting against feminism this guy thinks if he converts to islam then itll be easier to get a girlfriend this guy thinks itll be easier to find a wife if you become muslim
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so many gifts in one post school kid ✓ no women in stemstem master race ✓ women never approach me ✓ wife plz ✓ all rounding up to i fully admit i have no experience in this subject but let me lecture you about it dusted with a little bit of feeeemlaes✓
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im unsure if it would even be possible to follow everything in the biblequran to a t
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just reading that quote without having any other knowledge of islam at all i would have assumed it was forbidding sexual assaultnon consensual groping it seems like they just take it way too far
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive seen a similar line of thinking when it comes to women covering up too something about valuing them for their person and education instead of their body
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a friend of mine is a devout muslims and he definitely sees it as a respect thing the way he explains it is that its basically his way of being chivalrous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think ive specifically heard the not touching women thing being about respecting them its definitely not meant as a disrespect thing thinking theyre dirty or anything like that its not really one of the sexist islamic rules in that this one is completely symmetric in terms of gender there are other islamic rules which arent symmetric and are very sexist but i dont think this one is women are just as forbidden from touching men as men are from touching women who they arent related to married to i think judaism has a similar thing its basically an extension of trying to stop premarital sex and taking it really far men and women who arent related married should not touch each other unless its an emergency should not be alone in a room together unless its an emergency should not be together in a room in general for pleasure leisure ie work school shopping etc are ok to minimise the chance that they decide to start fucking each other basically the rule is basically to stop romantic touching groping etc but is written broadly in such a way that handshakes also fall into it women having to cover up is for the same purpose but is one of the examples where its not symmetric and so is actually sexist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope people dont buy it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what do you mean what happened
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is one of those things i find interesting how do you decide what to compromise like how do you know what your gods priorities are on various commandments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know a couple of muslim and jewish guys who wont shake hands with me because of religious principles but theyll nod and acknowledge me politely and i dont hold it against them however its obviously an extremely hard position to hold and i dont hold it against them for giving it up for business reasons either
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its hard to practice any faith in todays society sin what ever degree you define that is is so prevalent so many different temptations out there to lead us away even as helpful as technology is it too can become a vice people at a dining table looking at their phone and shoving food in their mouth im not comparing that to a son but still our world is changing the thing is we need to be able to put our big boy big girl pants on and learn to say no to stuff for me its so hard not want to run to the store but realize last second its a holy day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cant avoid shaking hands with people yes you can bigger issues than touching a nonmahram of the opposite sex for one of you to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle is better for him than that he should touch a woman who is not permissible for him yes im sure
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because youre only going to get the people who make that group a really firm part of their identity participating in a subreddit like that just like how most reddit users probably lean atheist but only the people who want to make a big point of it will actually use ratheism normal people for whom group membership only forms a part of their identity probably cant be bothered to participate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why is ratheism full of caricatures of atheists because the loudest voices always drown out the others that said rchristianity is pretty good there are quite a few gay and trans christians who participate in the community and it is always quite supportive for example the community helped someone who claimed to be involved with the kkk deradicalise themselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because religion in general us a caricature of religion in general
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well‐adjusted people go on reddit to browse dank memes and partake of popcorn not argue over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i expect its related to what happens to citybased subreddits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because islam in reality is about peace and luuuv right obviously these normal practicing sunni muslims must be wrong about their religion i know this because i read an article on huffpost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now tell us what is your opinion about the subject at hand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because it works as a safe space for muslims so they behave like they would when they are among likeminded muslims when it comes to religion and its importance in their lifes not like how they behave when they interact with nonmuslims or strangers just like every other group online they arent wearing any masks or selfcensoring their speech in the name of coexisting with others it requires a severe case of social awkwardness to behave irl just like they do online or do you think that for instance theredpill users are as openly misogynistic as they are online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rjainism all religions are not equal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is a good point i support peoples right to believe whatever they want and also for other people to criticize their dogma where theres dogma
SubredditDrama,not_removed,name checks out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the edginess is just too much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rredpillortaliban
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup isis and radical rightwingmisogynist groups are tapping hard into the increasingly large group of young men suffering from social isolation cultural alienation and sexual frustration its a huge huge problem thats responsible for a significant portion of our new and upcoming socioculturalpolitical problems that almost nobody seems to be acknowledging let alone trying to solve
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well this is quite possibly the most upsetting thing ive seen all year so far
SubredditDrama,not_removed,holy shit this comment in one of your linked posts muhammad married a year post wall nonvirgin hag islam is a cuck religion that teaches men to break their backs to support selfish female wives who live like queens to emulate their cuck prophet by becoming a beta bux provider to sluts who gave their youth to quraishi chads like abu sufyan abu sufyan the quraishi chad coming to theaters this fall
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i remember browsing in rincels and this guy made a post about how he hates women and wants to enslave them im more impressed that there was only one post for you to remember
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait how many women are in stem sociology and gender studies have more women than stem right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it wouldnt be possible there are tenets of both religions that are mutually contradictory its nighon impossible to get a book to remain entirely consistent with itself in terms of the proscriptions it has when it has multiple authors over a long period of time as is the case with both the bible and the quran here are a few examples leviticus says and in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised galatians on the other hand says behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing people will argue oh well leviticus described the code for the jews to live under and jesus established a new law for those who came after him but that could be argued both ways given that jesus is quoted in matthew as saying do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them faced with that seeming contradiction most christians simply do whatever they feel is right bringing their own morality to the equation likewise with the quran which contains both a passage seemingly condoning the consumption of alcohol and of the fruits of the datepalm and grapes whence ye derive strong drink and also good nourishment lo therein is indeed a portent for people who have sense and one clearly condemning it strong drink and games of chance say in both is great sin the issue with religious morality i think is that it becomes unethical when you ascribe every detail of a religious text to the religions followers when aspects of that text contradict one another it becomes patently absurd to assume that the religions followers adhere to every aspect of the text when that would be impossible furthermore its often forgotten that most members of any given major religion have either never read or only briefly skimmed the contents of their holy book people are born into religious communities and stay in those communities for a variety of cultural nonscriptural reasons criticism of religious texts should always be acceptable but a blanket assumption of the guilt of christians jews muslims based on what their holy book says is very dangerous it was a common antisemitic trope in nazi germany to say look what the jews in the old testament say about nonjews and how superior they are therefore all european jews hate us and want to destroy our society of course the vast majority of jews around at the time hadnt a clue about any of those parts of the holy book just like most christians dont consider the queasy parts of the new testament particularly the endtimes stuff which basically foretells an allout apocalypse to fuck over everyone who isnt christian you see a lot of this stuff happening at the moment where people allege that you cant trust muslims when they condemn religious violence because theyre practicing taqiya which doesnt mean what they think it means and most muslims have never heard of it anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats similar to the comments that the ayatollah made recently he claimed that the objectification of women by men in modern society was a zionist plot not because he believed such objectification degraded women but because he felt like putting them on a pedestal distracted them from their roles in society as cooks caretakers etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if only it was the same for men
SubredditDrama,not_removed,something about valuing them for their person and education instead of their body its just the other part of the coin if westerners value women by how sexual they are muslims value women by how modest and sexually inactive they are but i wouldnt say that they both do it to the same degree i havent heard of western women being killed for not engaging in premarital sex or dressing provocatively by their parents i havent heard of many women being shamed because they dont show their boobs or wear tight clothes you can choose not to sexualize yourself in western countries without facing terrible consequences but in muslim cultures being immodest certainly can make your life a living hell i like to quote from this article when a womans community acceptance respect dignity employability marriagiability physical safety enfranchisement social mobility access to social institutions freedom and autonomy hinge upon her daily unwavering public adherence to the bikini then we can make this comparison when a woman cannot leave her home in anything other than a bikini without being deemed immoral and her human worth and familys honor compromised then we can make this comparison when there are severe legal social and extrajudicial forces holding a womans safety wellbeing and livelihood hostage to her adherence to the bikini then we can make this comparison replace bikini with being sexually provocative and you will have the right picture
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how do you decide what to compromise well for me i just ask my conscience specifically can i live with myself if i do this to me touching someone from the opposite sex although technically forbidden as far as i know is really a minor issue all things considered i honestly dont go out of my way shaking hands with people but if a hand is proffered it is only polite that i do so on the other hand i probably wouldnt be having gay casual sex any time soon
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for me its so hard not want to run to the store but realize last second its a holy day i assume youre jewish i just ordered some groceries online for my mom so i was wondering can you order yours to arrive on the sabbath i mean i suppose just accepting stuff isnt working and is therefore okay right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,let me correct myself you cant avoid shaking hands with people unless if you want to out yourself as some sort of social pariah
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rchristianity is pretty good it is always quite supportive you seem to be generalizing and ignoring a large group of regulars there that post antilgbt comments in every relevant thread the sub is split and can range from pretty good to completely toxic depending on the threads and users involved there is even that supports the government putting gay people to death and the mods do nothing about it because he supports his views with the bible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt rchristianity encourage a gay guy trying to suppress his unnatural urges the subreddit has shown up on srd a number of times and ive never been impressed with it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive been a member of rjudaism for a few years and theyre a pretty good bunch however just like asking a rabbi in real life many questions are answered with more questions as my bubbe said two jews three opinions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont actually know any muslims my age who are this fucking weird their parents sure but the people i went to school with werent really much different than me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or do you think that for instance theredpill users are as openly misogynistic as they are online having had the pleasure of dealing with some in real life yes yes they are its difficult to hide that toxicity for very long shit seeps out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep this religion has a dead subreddit and other religions have active ones
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah youre right while i think those opinions are quite disgusting they do have the right to hold them its not illegal to be a dick and you should have full freedom to think and believe whatever you want
SubredditDrama,not_removed,holy shit thats a real thing two years now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is all true but how do you fix things like social isolation sexual frustration and overall existential angst how do you even start
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i guess its a womans duty to sleep with as many men as possible to alleviate that pressure and save the world surely women wouldnt be demonized for such promiscuous behaviour
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just wait till sexbots and virtual reality waifu simulators come out to solve that shit in no time well unless some feminist and conservative religious groups team up to ban them feminists will do it because they will believe it reduces women into literal sex objects religious groups will do it because well thats just pretty fucking obvious now isnt it in which case isincel will pretty much kill us all but for real tho anybody got some real ideas to solving this problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nono its them who have to get behind you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stem woman here o
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,protip you should get stoned before the sex
SubredditDrama,not_removed,matthew is generally understood to refer to the moral law – the part that really matters – rather than the ritualistic law that is indeed overridden by the new testament
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus didnt write galatians paul did and he was pretty explicit about abandoning the old ritual laws jesus probably wouldnt have agreed but he was dead and didnt have much to say about it i dont like paul very much ive always thought that he ruined christianity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,religion is just a lens for people to shape their worldview through it might influence but it doesnt control many ideologies can fit this definition though obviously im being reductionist id say it holds mostly true
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and of the fruits of the datepalm and grapes whence ye derive strong drink and also good nourishment lo therein is indeed a portent for people who have sense buddy i need verse number for that one i wanna see the preceding succeeding verse also drink can be mean normal drink or khamaralcohol so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they have a rule that hes not allowed to be alone with women so nothing to prohibit wild gay orgies then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to add on this is based off a common evangelical idea known as the billy graham rule heres a good breakdown
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til pence is muslim
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really a minor issue all things considered dont you think its kind of weird that your god would set down a pointless rule though it seems like if theres an allmighty allknowing god who tells you to do something thats pretty serious what if theres some massive cosmic reason for it that isnt readily apparent to nongods
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how do you know your conscience is any more reliable than the consciences of others who reach different conclusions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well of course because gay people are super evil amirite and being gay is totally a choice you could make at any time better make sure you dont wake up tomorrow craving gay sex s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not jewish this is a very debated subject jesus christ in his time was dealing with the very subject because of the wickedness of the children of israel moses was commanded to give them the lesser law a more tedious and exacting commandments for the disobedience and for being quick to worship the false gods of their excaptors after his time these laws in torah were getting to a point of ridiculousness ie you couldnt take an number of steps or your working from what i have read through my religious studies it doesnt make sense for things to so tedious to the exact second i mean if it the final judgements going to be a a while as i brought up earlier this wasnt the case with the lesser law these were added after the fact now in christian or jesus christ theology found in the commonly accepted cannon of the new testament jesus repeatedly said he came not to destroy but to give what was the higher law that moses originally went to give the coi so strict to less strict theology what im getting at is its more of whats in your heart i read a sermon on sabbath day worship and how we act our actions show our love for our heavenly father so if we ordered something and didnt think about it coming in sunday or we at fault for not having had the foresight to look ahead and say gee i better not order that because it would get here on sunday i think the most important point is what are you ordering that gets delivered on a sunday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not true plenty of muslim women and men function just fine in business environments without shaking hands besides a time will come on the people when the patient among them on his religion will be like one who holds live coal in his hand if you really were religious being a social pariah wouldnt bother you so much as disobeying your deen would
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you must be exaggerating oh god was not wrong in having them put to death in israel i do not believe it would be wrong to have homosexuals put to death according to the laws of any nation such as was done in england for hundreds of years and just as they also put people to death for bestiality and murder httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzsjswgpxbmg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you get people with questionable views but thats true of every subreddit most of the time rchristianity stays pretty level headed now rcatholicism on the other hand is actual cancer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most of my muslim friends are pretty much the same as me the only time their being a muslim is relevant is during ramadan when they start feeling guilty about smoking drinking and having sex but i acknowledge that thats because people arent one dimensional there are various forces affecting a persons world view if my friends decided to only focus on islam and made being a muslim their core identity then i wouldnt be friends with them much longer true believers are intolerable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank god no misogynistic muslims exist irl also how do you know people post to trp you ask people irl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nice backpedaling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like sexual frustration can be easily conquered by thorough and proper sexual education i can only speak anecdotally but i had really poor sexed where we were separated up as boys and girls and learnt literally nothing about the other sex and it was all very uninspired biology about the act of mating that was really it aside from youll get hair on your balls we learnt nothing about puberty emotional attachment flirting ideas of consent or confusion jack shit so come high school and these concepts and feelings begin to emerge i at least had no reference on what to do and it left me feeling isolated and bitter about sex thankfully ive come out better on the other side because of having some great friends to help navigate this minefield but if youre typically introverted it can be hard to find people to open up about your sexual confusion and i feel this issue is only going to gestate into something much worse if we dont address it quicker
SubredditDrama,not_removed,virtual reality waifu simulators tthese already exist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,noone is trying to ban sex robots and dolls getting a little creeper out about them isnt the same and if you were going to get one as a permanent companion i dont think you were on the market in the first place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one woman in stem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ehhh thats the majority view for sure but there has been heated debate over it for centuries someone like st augustine completely rejected the notion of a break with the old testament in any regard i actually agree that that is more likely than not what the authors were referring to but a lot of how people have come to that conclusion is through context clues ie jesus dropping lines throughout the gospels that seemingly contradict the mosaic laws ultimately because of the vague nature of matthew itself its a question well never be able to answer with certainty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like paul very much ive always thought that he ruined christianity but seriously youll get no argument from me there jesus obviously didnt write galatians but we have to engage with the text as it is not as we would like it to be otherwise you have to get into the thickets of translation issues as well as the question of the apocrypha that didnt make its way into the major canons
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see ive had the opposite experience almost all christians i know believe revelations is the literal future and the end times are coming very very soon not specific date death cult type beliefs but the jesus doesnt like the moral decay of society types
SubredditDrama,not_removed,preceding verse and indeed for you in grazing livestock is a lesson we give you drink from what is in their bellies between excretion and blood pure milk palatable to drinkers succeeding verse and your lord inspired to the bee take for yourself among the mountains houses and among the trees and that which they construct neither verse provides context for the passage i quoted which is surah verse the surah as a whole is talking about the wonders allah has bestowed upon the earth hence the talk of cows being given to humans to produce milk as for the reference to drink context is worthwhile the passage refers to grapes whence ye derive strong drink the reference to grapes and strong drink seems pretty likely a reference to alcohol although there is a translation issue because a few seem to go with vine instead of grapes also is your flair a reference to this issue or is it a coincidence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think you are allowed to be totally sober at wild gay orgies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i tend to prefer the secular youre a grownass man rule
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow the first statement without your addition made him sound like a terrifying sexual predator thanks for clarifying that its just runofthemill evangelical bullshit because that statement alone was scary and misleading
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or hes a christian and it just turns out american christians have a lot more in common with muslims than theyre willing to admit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til pence is a eunuch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,itll be like this there are sins against god and there are sins against your fellow humans and the latter is much much more troublesome to deal with than the former so you know im not sure that the current interpretation of the rules is really in line with divine favour but since he is allknowing and just i will leave my circumstances and context for him to judge and of course hope that he shows mercy against my failings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is not a conscience dickmeasuring device i am not trying to compare with anyone this is how do i want to live my life principle do you even know what youre asking like holy heck do you think im trying to impose my morals on others
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because gay people are super evil amirite no because im not attracted to men in general and especially to hairy men in particular what flipped off your switch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love it when internet progressives meet muslims for the first time and discover theyre not all socially liberal intersectional feminists like in their dreams
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not sure if youve one of bill mahers movie but there was a part which a jewish guy was dialing the telephone with a carrot on the sabbath because apparently thats a loophole
SubredditDrama,not_removed,plenty of muslim women and men function just fine in business environments where is this social environment that you speak of if you really were religious being a social pariah wouldnt bother you so much as disobeying your deen would i suppose its true but i do not live in a place so privileged that i can ignore all the social conventions that i must follow shaking a womans hands is a reasonably small sacrifice i dont mind doing besides where can you live in such a pure environment since youre on reddit that means youre using the internet do you avert your eyes every time a picture of an uncovered woman pops up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,antilbgt views in general get upvoted all the time there though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rcatholicism is full of the kinds of people who are driving me away from the church
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have had similar experiences a few muslim friends in college that partied harder than the white kids i really dont know how people can say all muslims are fundamentalists and then with a straight face also say not all christians are crazy the double standard is amazing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you might have me confused with someone else i just fail to see how a subreddit that averages comment or less per post is considered to be any kind of conclusive evidence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree and im sure everyone here does too sex education needs more funding to teach boys how to have sex
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this seems entirely unrelated to the problem its not that they dont know what sex is information is freely available anywhere you look its that they arent having it the whole thing is directly connected to social isolation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean like super advanced ones ai that actually talks to you and that will respond to your touch also comes with a fleshlight so you can bone her for real as far as i know nothing like this exists and if it does shoot me a link to where i can it for a friend of course
SubredditDrama,not_removed,todays sexbots yeah definitely not but wait twentyfifty years for advances in ai and robotics and it might be a different story
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpscampaignagainstsexrobotsorgabout
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this sex bots are creepy its an inanimate object design to satisfy sexual needs for men very problematic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh from the time i enrolled to the time i graduated ive seen more and more women in those degrees half my class were women
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i forgot to mention theres a verse that acknowledge alcohol has positive side but should be avoided since it brings more harm than good so its not really contradiction since its addressed in other verse i forgot which verse though i just remember it from haramization process for alcohol first its being addressed it bring more harm than good second your salat wont be recognized if youre intoxicated and the last one is finally being forbidden and my flair is completely coincidence it refers to a deleted comment in a post about pokemon go and gambling drama yes of course its rislam drama you can search the post int this subreddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and your lord inspired to the bee it just blows my mind how fully grown adults can take this shit seriously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a catholic who doesnt drink that does not compute
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pence isnt catholic hes an evangelical its a common misconception because he was raised catholic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it really depends on the denomination there are some denominations where this is defined the case but even catholics arent this conservative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no because im not attracted to men in general and especially to hairy men in particular the principle you gave was not shit i really want to do vs shit i dont care about it was i just ask my conscience specifically can i live with myself if i do this so naturally using not having gay sex as an example of stuff that you dont do implies that you consider it horribly sinful such that you wouldnt be able to live with yourself if you do it while people who do have gay sex obviously dont have such moral scruples i think we need a word like brocialist but for progressive muslims like you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,meh i say the same shit to my mormon relatives religions are all the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,says the guy whose comment history is full of swastikas and telling jews they arent welcome
SubredditDrama,not_removed,canada the uk america no you avert your eyes every time a picture of an uncovered woman pops up no why would i when im not muslim
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eeh theyre all cherry picking i think fundamental islam is worse than fundamental christianity i dont but into this ridiculous idea that all religions are equal s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean technically a religious subreddit cant be a caricature of its religion if it barely even exists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think theres any one panacea but i must disagree that the way we handle sex education is irrelevant there are a lot of unhealthyincorrect ideas about sex out there that can easily be addressed by comprehensive sex education sexual frustration can be informed at least in part by our ideas about sex but obviously you cant cure sexual frustration in general and this is just one component of a much larger whole
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ai that actually talks to you why would you want your waifu to have intelligence because if she did shed leave you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are dildos and vibrators creepy besides whos to say women wouldnt like to have sex bots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to give you a thought on the other side it blows the minds of devout religious people when people say everyone has their own truth or morality is just a social construct i think its the responsibility of both sides to understand the mindset of the other so that productive discourse can happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he does drink he just doesnt drink unless mother is around the temptation thing makes me wonder if he gets too grabby
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh apparently he describes himself as a bornagain evangelical catholic im not sure what that even means
SubredditDrama,not_removed,specifically can i live with myself if i do this well yes i cant live with myself if for some reason i slept with another man not being homosexual i would find it as repulsive as a gay man would if you force him to sleep with a woman by accusing me of thinking that gay people are evil im thinking youre projecting your own insecurities i clearly never made any insinuation to that while people who do have gay sex obviously dont have such moral scruples or and this may be a radical idea from a progressive muslim like me they may be gay therefore they do not have any mental block to do it like how people who has a bbw bent dont mind having sex with larger women that a lot of guys would rather not is there any other innocuous thing you want to get bent out of shape to oh oh ask me about sharia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,religions are all the same not really there are people who kill people because of their religion not really the same thing as your typical devout mormon
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah if they were all the same you wouldnt single islam out for so much misguided thirdparty defense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,canada the uk america yeah im not really buying that why would i when im not muslim in that case what business is it of yours how i conduct myself in my religion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,obviously they arent all equal but the bible says a lot of fucked up shit that most christians ignore so i dont see why they are given a pass on that but dont extend the same courtesy of the benefit of the doubt to moderate muslims
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from a female point of view my life is equally awful under pretty much every major world religion if youre going to be fundamentalist about it theyre all equal in that sense hence im not super fussed about what religion people follow im more concerned about how they treat me in a practical sense this includes atheists too lots of misogyny there as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this literally happens in her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats different sex bots objectify women
SubredditDrama,not_removed,too bad i never said that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now im imagining a slightly drunk pence perhaps after one wine spritzer slurring to some poor woman at a party hey i really like that sweater is that wool i love sheep can i feeeeeeeeeel hehehehe then mother comes storming over calls the woman a gussied up harlot drags pence out by the ear and gives him what for in the parking lot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ooh i got ya
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think he means he has certain catholic sensibilities or that he was born catholic the man is evangelical
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have relatives who were raised catholic but ended up joining evangelicaltype churches sometimes without doing any sort of formal conversion so it could be something like that ive been to a couple of their services and some seemed like mike pence would fit right in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can you give some more examples of sins that you dont commit because you wouldnt be able to live with yourself if you did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah someone who hasnt heard of the mountain meadows massacre or the mormon doctrine of blood atonement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jaladon the ocean darmok and jalad at tanagra the beast at tanagra
SubredditDrama,not_removed,k
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre pretending youre a muslim im just pointing out that you arent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,male sex bots objectify women but how are they different how do sex bots objectify humans in a way that sex toys do not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are we supposed to pretend that males arent attracted to the female form or that its a bad thing totally a dudes right to bone a sex bot if he wants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh i grew up in deep evangelical country and most of those folks thought catholics were evil and nonchristian i never realized catholicevangelical was an option
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i would be against most hudud punishments i know adultery is punished with stoning but unfortunately or maybe fortunately depending on your point of view im averse to pain and suffering i dont even like seeing cows getting slaughtered for meat this of course is harder to justify theologically since the punishment is more clearly defined however im banking on the fact that its pretty much impossible for four good men of impeccable character see the penis enter the vagina its one of those please please please dont happen but if it does ill just have to be a coward and still say no because oh god this is too cruel ditto for amputation it doesnt feel moral to make doctors do the opposite of healing if i am sinning because im going against this particular parts of the teaching well i just hope i can make a lot more good deeds in the future to offset it probably
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay but that happened in the century we are talking about what modern religious people are doing now not what their books say not what they did in the past what they are doing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rip your precious internet points
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre pretending i would like to see your credentials in judging the islamicness of others please
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rbutthurt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im from the midwest and this is in an area where the makeup is a mix of lutherans catholics and these churches which seem to all be formally nondenominational but in a way id call generic evangelical stylewise so idk maybe its a regional difference or the nondenominationalness is designed to rub the edges off so disaffected catholics and lutherans can get drawn in anecdotally it feels like new ones are popping up over the place and that catholicism at least is losing people in two directions now both to nonchurchgoing and to these
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no im asking which sins do you personally not commit because you wouldnt be able to live with yourself if you did similar to having gay sex as opposed to sins that you do commit because your conscience doesnt protest too much like when touching someone from the opposite sex or sinning by not punishing people for adultery if thats what you meant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so the real difference is not that muslims kill people because of their religion and mormons dont its that middle eastern religions are permitted to and western religions arent i say this because the mormons only stopped being shitty due to social pressures for a more recent example their god changed his mind about whether black people could be church leaders right after the civil rights movement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we are i thought we were talking about a heterosexual man who said that he would kill himself if he slept with another dude because it made him feel icky to think about it not because he was muslim
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol i have this user tagged as gatekeeper they also believe that jws arent christians and that lady gaga isnt bi they gatekeep every fucking thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wth did i just read
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i believe you entirely im from the colorado springs area where there is no historical catholic influence but where james dobson focus on the family rules over thousands of square miles of evangelical families if you ask any of them what denomination they are theyd say christian and they dont believe that catholics mormons or jehovahs witnesses are christians its interesting to see how evangelical culture varies in different parts of the country because it never would have occurred to me that someone could consider themselves catholic and evangelical

SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was countering the argument that only the us canada and mexico are the only north american countries because of things like nafta
SubredditDrama,not_removed,euronymous died for this shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for real thoughwhy is there so much nazism in black metal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my favorite metal bands are disturbed and korn what about you guys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre an autistic cunt no youre an autistic cunt prime metalhead argvment skills
SubredditDrama,not_removed,avelucifer is arguably the most obnoxious human on the planet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont hate black metal people just black metal culture
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rshitthefalsesay is that like an antianti elitism sub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,could that guy not think of a single less ridiculous synonym for mollycoddling lmao
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like that guy uses the word literally way too much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to within minutes obvious vote manipulation is obvious an entire votes call the brigading police we have an army of downvoters here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,itt avelucifer being a shithead you could probably feed this sub once a week on avelucifers posts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that thread is the perfect example of why i love black metal but i dont post about it at all metal forums are obnoxious as fuck i can post in rhiphopheads or rindieheads without too much drama but every single metal discussion seems to turn into a debate over whos more kvlt or trve the number of people in that thread who are simultaneously complaining about casuals and elitists at the same time is hilarious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,myonymous did nothing of the sort
SubredditDrama,not_removed,several reasons i guess norse mythology is a common theme in bm so youve got that whole asratuodinist demographic that it appeals to which has a lot of crossover with white power people other than that i guess its a genre which uses extreme iconography so i guess it seems an appropriate genre with which to explore those themes i guess to a degree people might use nazi themes for shock value its a genre which attracts a lot of angry young white guys who want something to blame for stuff ancient european cultures being destroyed by judeochristian religion etc and a lot of them focus more on the judeo part of that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well possibly because it was varg who killed euronymous when they fought euronymous was actually deeply into hardline communism for a significant part of his life and was more a fan of brutalist antiindividualist philosophies varg on the other hand had connections with the farright which only deepened when he went to jail apparently when they arrested him they also found plans hed made to blow up some socialist hq in norway but he held back on because he was afraid the communist meaning euronymous would warn others about it in short a bunch of teens and early year olds with links to biker groups and extreme politics eventually tried to kill each other and the nazi shithead won over the stalinist shithead if that had switched around maybe thered be more of a farleft bent to it pure speculation though anyway the connection between organized national socialism and bm petered out for the most part around gorgoroth lead singer gaahl mentioned that he was part of a ns gang for a bit mainly to avoid getting beaten up by them which he feared in part because hes gay so maybe its typical gang tactics of intimidationacceptance towards a group of young at the time kids who were already on the fringes and didnt know better anyway as black metal has grown up the neonazi associations are not seen as acceptable as they once were
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same reason httpsenwikipediaorgwikiunblackmetal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,black metal is more of the geek whos too cool for dungeons and dragons and plays some weird obscure table top rpg that like six people have heard of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,evanescence is pretty good i like it when the guy says wake me up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,have you heard about this superobscure band called metallica totally changed my life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill pay you shekels to post that there theyll most likely burn your house down though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,decided to go in a different direction with this joke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and one of the greatest dude is a hero to the cause of shutting down tourists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,his approach to music is really really odd the amount he talks about being objective when listening to bm or anything is strange as fuck surely enjoying music or any other art form is massively subjective that kind of talk also makes me think the person saying it knows fuck all about music but knows lots of facts about bands and prides themself on it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im legit jealous of their hair
SubredditDrama,not_removed,leave the hall
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the most important sub on reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think you might be a bit too used to subs where the votes will swing like points in five seconds if theres drama going on because thats quite a large amount of votes in a sub that size especially in just five minutes to put it in perspective the counter on the subreddit dont know how accurate those are tells me theres about people on right now you dont think every use active on the sub at that moment downvoting a comment would be a little bit weird
SubredditDrama,not_removed,many have burned and died by his hand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like somebodys false
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh now its euronymous when we bought it it was ouronymous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,euronymous was actually deeply into hardline communism for a significant part of his life and was more a fan of brutalist antiindividualist philosophies so tankie black metal couldve been a thing i bet tankie black metal is already a thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tbh the influx of nsbm postnorway heyday was heavily influenced by lords of chaos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so it basically boils down to young people being stupid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is perfect for them also its secretly prochristian in that its about learning to forgive people who really dont deserve forgiveness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,burning wheel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,soo pathfinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cant wake up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey my favorite band too httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvgqmnsxqxno
SubredditDrama,not_removed,long hair is a pain the ass though i can only imagine they go through conditioner like varg goes through churches and thats before getting to the extreme ridiculousness that is ross dolan dudes hair practically a cape at this point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not as fun as it looks but if youve ever had it you will miss it forever once you go back to normal haircuts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is absolute mayhem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its called rabm red and anarchist black metal not many of them are actually tankie gulag is the only one off the top of my head that i think is actually tankie like marquisdesmoine said most are green anarchists panopticon is my favorite
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think theres a couple of far left bands but they are pretty sparse and probably more green than tankie but yeah thatd be an interesting turn of events
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also true really really not a fan of that book it was pretty much a mayhemcult circlejerk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of course varg would have his own racist ass version of dd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,come for the racism stay for the uninspiring font choices
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pathfinder isnt even remotely obscure also it is dungeons and dragons
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or fatal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is it the one that goes bhraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa oh shit a chord change bhraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa but seriously i really do love them their grimmrobe demos anniversary show was the closest i ever got to a religious experience still not being facetious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you know what i was on mobile at work and couldnt watch the video this is fucking brilliant haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im balding so yeah
SubredditDrama,not_removed,panopticon is amazing and the dude behind that project runs an absolutely stellar brewery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes also really into larping which i find hilarious he looks so cute in his little viking outfit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what a pleb i bet they havent even played their own custom httpsenwikipediaorgwikinobilis variant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,was waiting for that he seems like exactly the sort of person who would play fatal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh man you ever read the rulebook for fatal its fucking amazing from the rolls for substats to the several chapters on anatomy to the fact that theres a footnote explaining the word butterface
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they are really friggin great i didnt really get them until a friend lent me his vinyl of monoliths and dimensions and told me to just lay down and listen to them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah hammerheart is one of my favorites
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i only read the article on the thing didnt dare go further than that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i did go further and read the rulebook my advice dont go further and read the rulebook
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all gender modifiers are based upon scholarly literature
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and the dude posts frequently to thedonaldbig shocker there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no debate neededyour standard stormfront rthedonald white supremacist fare
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres pride in your country and then there is making nationalism the primary aspect of your political opinions to the point of making it your username and only posting photos of blonde nordic people all extremes are bad if someone put muslim or vegan in their username and only posted extracts from the koran or vegan quotes i would be just as criticising as he is gotta be careful of those darn muslims and grits teeth vegans from spreading their agendas theyre just as bad as white nationalists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,white nationalists tend to be proud of being racist while at the same time performing crazy mental gymnastics to actually avoid admitting it its like the nazi holocaust deniers that dont believe it happened but would be fine with it if it had it must be tough being a racist stooge
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is going around posting the clintonbyrd klan pic but leaps to the defense of white nationalists berniebros do the darnedest things

SubredditDrama,not_removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about my research objectives you little respondent ill have you know i completed my class in research methods in the social sciences with a passed designation and ive been involved in numerous survey designs i am trained in statistical analysis using r and im the top social science researcher on tenure at my community college you are nothing to me but just another respondent and i will survey the fuck out of you with providing you are giving informed consent and are aware of the methods being used to collect store and analyze the data you think you can get away with not revealing an accurate response to a sensitive topic think again fucker as we speak i am asking you to flip a coin and if heads answer question a and if tails answer question b so you better prepare for the sensitive information reveal because im not asking you to tell me which side the coin landed on im going to instead use statistical analysis to derive the accuracy of responses because question a is simply the month your mother was born on meaning a distribution but question b youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can survey you in nearly infinite way that complies with my reb not only am i extensively trained in r but i have access to in mturk credits and i will use it to its full extent to get enough of a sample size you little shit youre fucking analyzed kiddo

SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is a lot of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but we require of back and forth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dammit i was excited for my first srd feature was my ban really for nothing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope you enjoyed the most amount of power youll ever have in your life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now kiss
SubredditDrama,not_removed,genuinely surprised rsquaredcircle isnt on here more often
SubredditDrama,not_removed,full quiet passive bitch men this seems like the title to a gay porn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i never got the appeal of wrestling they do know its all choreographed right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i made subredditdrama squabbling on the internet does get you somewhere
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just wait til cm punk has his first ufc fight it might actually be worse than when reigns won the rumble
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a goldmine jerry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh snapshill you so salty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes just like every single other fictional tv show
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you know the battle of bastards involved fake horse collisions but in a non snark reason wrestling at the heart of it is a workplace drama with loads of layers of storytelling the characters are all looking for their moment of fleeting glory with each ideally choosing what level of pride individualism decency and physical exertion that they are willing to sacrifice along with the trials they face to achieve their goals do they kiss ass to the boss to get an easy path up do they turn on their former friends to raise themselves up do they stay true to their values despite being the shittiest and riskiest path on the second level is the universe where a lot of the stories are weaved into the backstage workings of the characters then theres the stories of the people playing those characters because of the fairly small industry everyone has an opinion on everyone with cornette v the world being the longest and most bitter fued finally you get to see cool flippy shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a show that featured zombies and vampires at one point is fake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it certainly is choreographed and in of matches the end is preplanned but people still get hurt sometimes very badly one in particular just came back from a concussion after messing up a baseball slide to get out of the ring but for the most part it comes down to how well they can perform
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like going to watch an action movie you can still enjoy it even though the gun fights arent real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh no next youre going to tell me got is just a tv show and no one has actually died
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in the words of ron funches
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like to compare it to a pantomime you know its silly and its just a bunch of dudes in costume but you sit back enjoy the story and boo when the bad guy comes out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wrestling is fake no way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it depends i dont think anyone even the most hardcore of punks fan base are under any pretense that punks walking out of that one the winner i think everyone knows at best he wont completely embarrass himself and odds are hes getting his ass kicked the question is how smug punks detractors are about it afterwards cause any drama that kicks off is probably gonna come from that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is so postmodern
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol okay friend sounds like a soap opera
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mean the undertaker didnt actually kill his parents and set his brother on fire like times inconceivable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess people liking wrestling makes as much sense as people like soap operas
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so its basically just people performing cool stunts i can get behind that the overdramatic theatrics kind of turn me off though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,got doesnt pretend to be anything but fantasy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah thats why i said it might be it would be hilarious if theres someone online who sincerely thinks punk is going to win because hes the best in the world though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is its totally banal and pulp but theres catharsis when something good actually happens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a soap opera with some pretty staggering physical stunts thats literally what it is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so not only are you superior to wrestling fans but you are also superior to soap opera fans do tell us more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah its not for everyone it does look cool sometimes for the most part its all about who can act better get two really good wrestlers together and they can make a match seem very real while being perfectly safe if they cant work that well togetherit all falls apart really badly its like what you said elsewhere its basically a soap opera a soap opera with cool stunts sometimes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so theyre not pretending theyre olympicworthy or very real professional sport they planned the outcome but the roster themselves are the stuntmanwoman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive heard people say that punk might win cause lesnar did well in ufc so theres a chance punk could too ignoring that lesnar is a complete genetic freak of a human being a once in a generation type of athlete who if he didnt contract diverticulitis and started in mma at a younger age wouldve probably had a much more dominant career in ufc than he did not that is career was bad all things considered and punk while a good athlete in his own right really is not even in spitting distance of lesnar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not superior to either i just have superior taste d s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i only wish they could act better in terms of when theyre speaking lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats your point i never said wrestling was insulting i just find it silly how it takes itself so seriously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah thats exactly what i think of this whole thing too if punks an ufc ready fighter then so is every person that trains a bit in a mma gym every now and then i was just imagining a complete mark that thinks hes going to hit mickey gall with the go to sleep
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you catch a westler in bed with your mom or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a different style of acting more akin to anime or telenovella where its intentionally over the top and exaggerated or like bad shakespeare
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just like fans take their favorite moviescomiccartoontv showsvideo games seriously remember shipping
SubredditDrama,not_removed,triple x
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no i mean that the wrestling shows take themselves too seriously as they pretend like its the real deal get what im saying im probably wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this would have literally been the best place to say and his name was john cena and you blew it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sorry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vin diesel was never a wrestler
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah they treat it like the real deal because if they dont theres no stakes to the story if characters on game of thrones started calling each other by their actors real names and acknowledging that none of this has any real consequences itd ruin the show
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as they pretend like its the real deal besides injury that can be real fans expect better story so yeah real deal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my meme game is weak af
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its okay it has made me a stronger person
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont see how you guys can compare what is obviously fiction and doesnt pretend to be anything else to wrestling that is like a reality tv show in terms of bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i suppose if they didnt make a bunch of shit up there is only so much you can do with wrestling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats whats really important in life i feel better for talking it out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wrestling doesnt pretend to be real any more than a fictional tv show you know its not the anymore and wrestlers are pretty much always out of character outside of when theyre wrestling right reality tv stars dont go around giving interviews about their characters and storylines they legit act like its all real wrestlers acknowledge that its not real in public all the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so if they didnt make a bunch of shit up most movies would be boring
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you for being there for me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you for being a friend traveled down the road and back again your heart is true youre a pal and a confidant

SubredditDrama,not_removed,what even is a legitimate dialect do people think that certain dialects are objectively correct somehow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id love to hear how some of these people talk in casual conversation im sure they always use the perfect queens english
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpkzvoxkxfqk tldw aave is not just valid in the descriptivist sense of there is no correct way for a language to be but is also as structured and internally consistent as any other language or dialect people just have their own conceptions usually either racist or classist or both about those who speak it and project it onto the dialect as a whole as being unintelligent or bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stuff like this irks me almost as much as when people at my job make fun of people for saying aks instead of ask in casual conversation you know what the person meant youre just trying to disparage their statement because of how they say it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,next youll be telling me afrikaans is just butchered dutch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh ive always just heard it called ebonics which referred to anything from inner city slang to full blown jive a la i didnt realize that it was called aave or that there was even an official term for it til edit i try talk english good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also when people feel the need to copy and paste entry merriamwebstercom entries including the pronunciation and people who have fits over aave tend to be incredibly bland
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is something about people that say calling it aava is racist that rubs me the wrong way it just doesnt seem genuine to me not to say it isnt a discussion to be had it is just it comes off as concern trolling as they say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i grew up in the very south of austria and my dialect is one that i reckon is even less intelligible to speakers of high german than aave is to speakers of standard american english i wonder if they would have any problems with it being my mother tongue edit disclaimer im white
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im baffled by people who views metathesis as somehow invalid and a sign of ignorance do you pronounce iron as eyeorn metathesis prescription as perscriptshon metathesis comfortable as comfertable metathesis ask instead of aks as chaucer did metathesis so everybody needs to shut the hell up about someone who wants to aks a question or who talks about nucular proliferation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why dont southerners get the same amount of flack for their speech as blacks do southern and black dialects are very very similar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,scotch is trash regardless of age merrily skips away from conversation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think choosing to use aave is any indication of intelligence the problem comes when you are unable to communicate in any other way if you cant write or speak in standard english its going to be difficult to be successful in the classroom and many work places
SubredditDrama,not_removed,prestige dialects are just as meaningful as any other signal that demonstrates education wealth or status yet the same people who get their knickers twisted over people ridiculing aave ridicule other peoples fashion choices and cultural preferences all the time if you talk like that it isnt because youre necessarily dumb but it is because youre dumb that you dont understand how other people perceive you for talking like that you cant help your upbringing but if you cant code switch then how smart could you possibly be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why cant these black people speak properly and by properly i mean the way that white people speak
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think we should declare aave the only legitimate dialect just to watch people throw a shit fit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,short answer yes they do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the counter argument ive heard is that aave has a lot of grammar features that occur only in african languages theres a verb tense that most other dialects of english dont have im not sure i buy it it sounds like southern english to me but thats the general idea
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean my first thought when i hear legitimate dialect is is it a dialect or a language or a register which frankly is quite the debate about several varieties of various language but thats probably giving them too much credit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im so proper i use semicolons when i speak
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is no correct way for a language to be tss tss thats just because you dont have an institution founded four hundred years ago by the bad guy from the three musketeers full of mostly old white guys telling everyone how the language has to be like we have for french
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its unfortunate i dont necessarily think there is a a correct way for a language to be but i do think there are more practical considerations to be made and as a result dialects not just aave can be less suitable for use in a situation compared to the standardized form of the language in certain contexts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well since chaucer used aks and since chaucers middle english was the predecessor to modern english id say the aks speakers have a better grasp of their language
SubredditDrama,not_removed,afrikaans is just butchered dutch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh lord butchered dutch is putting it lightly futsek that is one ugly language
SubredditDrama,not_removed,butchered dutch only coloured peoples afrikaans white peoples suiwer afrikaans is a legitimate language
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the change was kinda brought about to take away from the sorta racist connotation of ebony with africanamerican people like how it used to be seen as okay to call asian people oriental back in the day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aave is the academic term most people do still call it ebonics black people included
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people who have fits over aave tend to be incredibly bland citation needed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is unquestionably theyre looking for something that sounds more derogatory
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as an english speaker learning german i can conclusively say that your dialect is wrong and i need you to adapt for my benefit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,edit disclaimer im white whatever you do is correct then as long as it has nothing to do with negroes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nucular im okay with literally any dialect in the world being widespread and proliferated i dont care if everyone starts speaking italianjapanese or northernneverland or fucking zapf dingbats im okay with any of it nucular im not okay with this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they often do actually even if youre white if you talk like a redneck theres people that automatically assume youre stupid because of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well one of the guys i was fruitlessly arguing with brought up the southern dialect as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you know the answer to this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you are dead to me dont listen to him my precious scotch daddy loves you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it tastes like hot dog water
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats like saying all bread is trash theres too much variation in scotch if you like any whiskey at all youll find a scotch you probably enjoy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not the point at all here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good thing that thats not a problem that actually happens then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think not caring if youre perceived as intelligent by random strangers is really an indication of intelligence at all lmfao the way i talk in casual conversation doesnt sound very smart but i dont care because worrying about if people think im intelligent based on my speech alone is at the very bottom of my list of priorities lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if a dialect is spoken by enough people to warrant being called a dialect i think that there is a sizable chunk of people whod disagree with the dialect sounding unintelligent imagine being in the deep rural south and one farmer catches another saying yall and breaks into a tirade how his lack of codeswitching insults his intelligence yet the same people who get their knickers twisted over people ridiculing aave ridicule other peoples fashion choices and cultural preferences all the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that only holds true if you consider business enviromments where youd be required to code switch to succeed to be the only place youd find a smart aave speaker there are livelihoods that wouldnt require it such as community engagementorganizer roles or small businesses in a black community and so on and since thats true it follows that there are both smart people capable of code switching and smart people who wouldnt code switch because they have little use for it and im sure theres also dumb people who fit knto both those catagories further if you hear someone speaking in aave youd have to stalk them for a heck of a long time to determine if they can codeswitch or not the point of all this being that people are complex and live complex lives and you cant make snap judgements or really any meaningful judgements at all about their intelligence or capabilities based on their dialect alone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those who speak the dominant dialect first cant code switch and will never have their intelligence questioned for that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont go to the uk then its full of people speaking butchered english
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey now my irish great uncle was totally incomprehensible to me and he found my accent impenetrable were both native english speakers which one of us was speaking butchered english perhaps a better example im not great spanish speaker but i was taugh by a spaniard and found peruvian spanish extremely difficult are the peruvians butchering the language or is continental spanish weird antiquated and kinda lispy its all down to where you come from and whatwhere you learned no language or dialect is butchered by any objective measure you just dont have enough knowledge of it to make sense of it and thats fine but dont put that on others just because you cant make sense of them its hardly their fault you dont speak their dialect
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill allow your snark to pass if you concede that white people who grow up in certain neighborhoods where aave is predominant should be allowed to use that dialect without being mocked edit i seemed super douchy what i meant to say is im gonna start using that line but i wanna know if you think what i said is a good viewpoint this is strange my post went from like to almost what happened
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or just start referring to the type of english these people call the correct version as white peoples dictionary english or something else that gives a better acronym than wpde which sounds like a kind of plastic to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a sociolinguist in the and among other things argued that black people andor people with low ses narrated life events better than white people andor the bourgeoisie further reading httpwwwlingupenneduwlabovsfshtml havent dug any deeper to see if there was a shitfit but i do know that the linguist labov is famous for his white savior complex
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is kind of the coolest one we might as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,even if that were true it doesnt negate the fact that the vast majority of aave grammar and vocab are english southern californians tend to mix some spanish into their speech that doesnt make them not english
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the idea that aave has any relation to african languages was either debunked or not ever taken seriously its much more closely related to the scotchirish dialects the original southern planters spoke thats who early slaves would have learned english from
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so i speak fluent french and visiting montreal was weird as hell because quebec doesnt have this and english keeps sticking itself into random sentences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no one understands the glory of ultrafrench
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if we did it would probably be completely irrelevant just like the french one is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but thats not actually a problem for people who speak nonstandard dialects like i have plenty of students who based on my conversations with them their native dialect is some form of aave theyre not all highquality writers but the problems they have arent unique to and as best i can tell are in no way linked to their use of aave as a spoken languagetheyre the same problems that my other students have those who are native english speakers at leastthose whose native language is something other than english tend to have different sorts of problems
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no dialects are not better just because theyre more conservative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and dutch is just butchered german tbh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also describes vlaams
SubredditDrama,not_removed,futsek if i may the word you wanna use here is vok voestek means fuck off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im pretty sure the mainstream academic term used in the was black english vernacular by the noweminent sociolinguist bill labov ebonics was coined by a panafricanist social psychologist named robert williams who wanted to emphasize the theorized overlap between aave and west african languages which most linguists now believe doesnt exist edit previously aave had been named things like nonstandard negro english vernacular by white linguists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that makes sense i guess its important to have a name for it linguistically
SubredditDrama,not_removed,obviously only vanilla missionaryposition sex is acceptable to this dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol dont worry though everybody speaks standard german as well just with an accent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly using a southern accent is to go to for being trigger warning stupid everybody wants to white knight blacks but they talk like idiots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,daddy im kinkshaming
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn i need some of your hot dogs then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you mean a dog that was ill and taken to a veterinary hospital which then suffered a terrible fire because the smoky rubble of burning tires and medicinal waste is basically how i would describe laphroaig
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it tastes like a paper mill stinks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,try getting a good job speaking like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those damn english butchering english why cant they speak it properly like the americans i see on tv
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are definitely white people who speak similarly to aave and arent mocked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but does happen a lot actually as long as it sounds natural and not forced or flaunted i dont think most black people have a problem with it also with the range of skin tones for black people it becomes real hard to figure that situation out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cae or crackerass english
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that kinda thinking gets us things like at the turn up function and matt mcgory is wokest bae
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im no dialectician but i would argue the randomrandom english cropping up has more to do with quebec being surrounded by englishspeaking canada and less to do with the lack of an academy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,haha yeah but i think technically people all over the francophonie are supposed to follow what the académie française says which why people fom outside of france can get in like dany laferrière recently they have a lot of weight on how french is written but not so much on how it is spoken
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so i needed to add a s at the end after all dialects are neither better or worse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fucking swamp germans they ruined german
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and english is just butchered dutch with an abusive french uncle so where does that leave us
SubredditDrama,not_removed,german is just butchered flemish
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would argue with you but you are clearly the authority on idiocy here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kinkshaming turns me on kinkshame me some more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol my last two jobs before going back to school were in corporate marketingcommuncations so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,chav is totally a dialect its really hard to get used to though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you dont see the similarities between continental and latin american spanish and your difficult in understanding some black americans hell im not on this but wouldnt a quechua person speaking spanish in peru be hard to understand if someone only spoke spanish as a second language even if spanish was their first language if they come from a quechuan community that would affect their pronunciation im suren youd agree that its hardly the quechua persons fault if i dont understand their accent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you realize that your response is pretty objectively childish right if you want to argue something argue it dont just start throwing around buzzwords if your opinion actually has worth you should be able to back it up with actual counterpoints
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a non american aave just sounds really similar to southern accents to me is that just me or are they actually similar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but theyre white so its not as fun to mock them cause they look like me said by a dumbass redditor somewhere
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eminem for example
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where ill mock them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my nextdoor neighbor growing up who is still one of my best friends is black and he recently pointed out the enormous amount of aaveisms in my speech that were pretty sure i got from him id never noticed before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this gets brought up whenever theres aave drama people hate taking it seriously because they hate talking about race so they insist that the same standards be applied to white people who speak in that dialect so its not reverse racism or whatever and they can think of it in raceneutral terms but its a false equivalency white people who use aave dont get made fun of because its not proper english they get made fun of because more often than not theyre putting on airs and it looks ridiculous like american teenaged girls trying to do british accents that are have brp and half cockney like you said if it sounds natural and not forced i dont think anyone — black or white — has a problem with people talking this way when people do take issue with it its because its forced
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry its just that in addition to the prestige dialect is the only correct one people there are also the people who go around doing things like using long s on reddit because it was older and therefore must be more correct and you never can tell
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when it comes to employment prospects they are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if i wanna be completely fair id say that dutch and german both have the same root language that is actually more similar to dutch than german so in essence german is a bastardized version of dutch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,being conquerors
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah nigga get off ma dick homie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,😠
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is the ultimate kink
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yea and you probably turned it off in the office because my dick this and nigga that would get you fired
SubredditDrama,not_removed,given that most black people either live in the south or have ancestors who did for obvious reasons therell be a lot of similarity in accents at least
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they are super close edit i should elaborate aave and the vulgar southern accent are very similar not aave and aristocratic southern
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the accent is similar but there are some grammatical differences for example the habitual be in aave isnt something ive heard used in other dialects common to the south
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aave kind of branched out of the southern dialect
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ask macklemore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how do you even find a long s typefet alfo by that logic shouldnt we all juft be speaking babylonian or protoendoeuropean or some reconftructionift african language what a bizarre idea
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes but he was just being a pain in the assssss sorry but i did go down that rabbit hole s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre a bastardized version of dutch got eem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont they have different if related root languages lower german and dutch seem to have had their roots in a relatively different germanic language to higher german
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pol is that way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yea and thats what im saying most people are able to do that so saying if you speak that way in casual conversation that means you dont realize that people think you sound dumb and that makes you dumb is stupid lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you didnt get into an argument you cited anecdotes and called people names
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you want an intrastate example of dialect difference causing communications issues the uk is a good example i imagine not many rp speakers could penetrate the language of a yorkshireman with a tendency to sing about the time he was on ilkla moore baht at but you certaintly wouldnt accuse him of lazy english his family has been speaking it like that for centuries the argument that its lazy grammar and slang is an unfortunate and misguided argument its different grammatical structure and different words like any other dialect i cant speak to swearing i probably swear too much myself and i doubt youd have any trouble understanding me but anyway since im sure youll be reading this if you feel like coming back to this in the morning you might enjoy some academic literature on the subject a good primer and short at pages might be language deficits or differences what we know about african american vernacular english in the century which breaks down how aave does follow understandable and studyable form and structures how could it not speakers wouldnt be able to understand each other otherwise but the article also dives into the difficulties of being an aave speaker and why those difficulties exist which i think youd find really interesting though the answer is definitely not aave speakers are dumb i dont want you to think i think youre a crazy racist or anything i think youre misinformed but i understand where youre coming from youve touched the nail on the head rather than hit it directly people do look down on aave speakers is it aave speakers failing to conform to mainstream societal expectations should people change make it easier on the majority or is societal pressure on aave speakers misguided ignorant and hypocritical given how many other dialects dont face the same pressure its not crazy to think the former but i do think its wrong i hope you get where im coming from i feel kind of scummy treating it as such a conceptual academic issue to be honest and i hope you dont think less of me it was just the easiest way i knew to break it down these are peoples live and what theyre allowed to do with them at the end of the day not an abstract concept
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that makes a lot of sense cheers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,glad im not the only one who thinks so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what about preposition dropping i forget if se drop prepositions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh nevermind then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,here you can have it unicode codepoint latin small letter long s ſ also a lady fighting the good fight for long eſses in rlearnjapaneſe of all places
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if youre not speaking protonostratic youre just not trying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,þæt wæs god cyning
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it should be aſs i think
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my parents are married but i am dutch so lets say youre percent right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i why i get that its cool to know about and all but the long s has a completely obfolete function the only reason it endured so long was because it printed eafier iirc like this is legitimately ridiculoufly dumb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in aave where you can contract a preposition in sae hes at the pool you can drop a preposition in aave he at the pool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youll need the long s to differentiate between the german wachstube tl tube of wax and wachſtube tl guard post which are obviously used all the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it definitely wasnt easier to print ever since the invention of movable type long s needs all kinds of special consideration in typography like ligatures eg ſt or ſi and proper kerning in pairs like ſe and ſs while short s looks and works the same everywhere eta oh and thats basically why fhes fo ftuck on it probably because typographers have it too easy httpsenwikipediaorgwikilongs the printers grammar describes the transition away from the use of the long s among typefounders and printers in its list of available sorts the introduction of the round s instead of the long is an improvement in the art of printing equal if not superior to any which has taken place in recent years and for which we are indebted to the ingenious mr bell who introduced them in his edition of the british classics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have heard this in se but less commonly than in aave and only in certain constructions like ive never heard he at the pool from a se speaker but ive heard he lost bad as in he doesnt know where hes going it might actually be a creole thing now that i think about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is is a verb not a preposition so i dont see how your example could be called preposition dropping
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in that phrase at is the preposition and is which is dropped is the verb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh so it really was just a particularly persistent archaicism til thats interesting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i might be using the wrong word description what type of verbs are is am are etc again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those are all conjugations of the verb to be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and they also have the ability to be used in conjunctions unlike regular verbs they have a label because of that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey jokerang thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because there is not enough drama to merit an srd submission please wait and see if things develop further or look for a subthread with more drama make sure youre linking with the proper context events such as x sub was hacked or y sub was made private are not drama in and of themselves do not just link to a subreddit that was taken over if there are dramatic happenings around the takeover please make a self post and include links to drama that users can read for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you took a break from your allday masturbation to post this sad penis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wipes tear from face wewe made itour little sub made it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is the kind of drama i enjoy innocuous subject matter with a clear villain and repeated defiant meltdowns would schadenfreude again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was curious about rholdmycatnip mindless cat cat cat chains are strongly forbidden because we think theyre stupid and will not be tolerated here brutal reprisals andor banning may result added liberty died on the of smarch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was just reading that thread thinking this belongs here not happy is a diplomatic way of putting it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aaaaaand ive exceeded my daily intake of sodium
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why do people get so upset about reposts edit missed this crucial part
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol that loser doesnt even have a designated troll account
SubredditDrama,not_removed,starlightdaww occums razor just admit that its a repost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,schadenfreude who you callin a freude im not a freude feute me irl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lousy smarch weather
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think theyre more annoyed at the op lying by saying that it was their photo rather than just reposting content
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not the repost its that the mod deleted all mentions of it and then locked the thread because hes not mature enough to mention how reposts and fake titles are within the rules of the subreddit and now hes fruitlessly trying to defend himself in the rquityourbullshit thread by claiming everyone calling him out has autism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh idk it seems to me that theyre more upset he titled it as his own
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think occams razor means what i think you think it means
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey lets just leave each others hot dads out of this okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,freude means joy by the way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is calm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just fyi this is the guys alt some people just need to accept when to stop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,omg can you believe that asshole mod actually locked the thread the flag has fallen reeeeeeeeeeeee a cat sub is not conforming to my arbitrary rules so i must spam it with irrelevant shitposts until he locks it i saw that cat years ago and i must never see it again is not the response of a calm catnip mod
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,plenty of people raging about reposting old jokes in addition to the stuff about mod removing comments i get why people are upset about comments being removed and whatever im asking specifically why people care about reposted stuff especially when the last time it was posted was years ago edit missed this crucial part
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ohhhh i missed that i thought the mod was reposting his own content makes more sense then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then proceeded to delete comments saying so on his subreddit ban users who responded in rquityourbullshit and ramble like a loon in the comments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no they said occums razor its a totally different principle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know not sure what i meant with that whole bit honestly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats the mods alt account youre replying to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah thats the mod mocking the other users who are so angry about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i always wanted to see a punch and judy show this is close enough for me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the title of the post is we stayed at a quaint little bed breakfast in vermont and it had the cutest bedbugs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,arent you the mods alt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,other than the fake title he also claimed the original photo was his in this comment seems like a pretty stupid guy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh no i dont want to know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no problem joy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im aware
SubredditDrama,not_removed,angry mocking is still angry and when you get that over the top youre usually pretty mad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it sounds like hes getting worked up even in his sarcastic response also it seems like his mocking impression totally exaggerates the response i dont think anyone felt that strongly about it before the mod started deleting comments and then typed this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you must be new around here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its only implied that it is his photo to be fair he says one of the first not the first i know hes taking too much creative liberty with his title but an implication isnt an outright claim
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre a lot calmer than the other users
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hyperbolic mocking isnt really a good indicator of anger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there was speculation in the linked thread that this was one of the mods alt accounts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can i not repost my own stuff that looks like a claim to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpiimgurcomrgjdwhlgifv
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus christ how many alts do you have
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in what way what other user was any less calm than that who was even close
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this guy must have a lot of alt accounts wait am i an alt account who isnt an alt account
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no u baiting pls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,referring to his post thats what i get from that he was one of the first thought it did well and grabbed that post to repost because karma is clearly the most valuable thing one can aspire to have
SubredditDrama,not_removed,calmer nyou are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont get why people like the big lebowski so much ive seen american stand up routines that were funnier and thats not saying much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,new flair soon attack of the alts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah well thats just like your opinion man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its geared to an american sense of humor just as american stand up routines tend to be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,differing opinions arent always bait sometimes theyre just differing opinions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if by american sense of humour you mean terrible i agree
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the first sentence of your post is an opinion the second
SubredditDrama,not_removed,both of those sentences are opinions i didnt realise that simply disagreeing with people counts as bait nowadays i guess ill stick with the circlejerk next time i feel like commenting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,except youre not simply disagreeing with people youre giving your opinions plus adding an extra helping of fuck you to it each time thats what makes people think its bait youre doing it again here im not surprised that so many people think youre doing this deliberately to get a rise out of others because its pretty rare to find someone who is genuinely so condescending without meaning to be go ahead and pout about it if you want but people arent going to agree with you just because the alternative is you looking down your nose at them have a good day buddy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not adding an extra helping of fuck you im just expressing a negative opinion which people seem to be acting really defensively about im sorry that i didnt find the big lebowski funny i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me

SubredditDrama,not_removed,a communist and trump supporter walk into an askreddit thread the jokes practically write themselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he chooses a dvd for tonight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that guy thinks mandela remained a communist he was in prison for years lots of things changed about him during that period south africa even when mandela was president was generally a firm believer in general free markets he may have privately held different beliefs but his public actions as president of sa were as a free market guy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i bet this cat also really liked martin luther king jr
SubredditDrama,not_removed,names nothing but pork products assumes veganism upon rejection filthy plebeian detected

SubredditDrama,not_removed,they both look full on retarded in that thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh never thought i would be featured on srd considering how much i visit this place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and marriage is for faggot cuckolds who think they get women cause they have to hunker down it doesnt make any sense

SubredditDrama,not_removed,what does it matter if the communist doesnt like bacon if hes making the sandwich for the trumpanzee have some manners and put what the man wants on his sandwich dammit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who the fuck eats ham on thanksgiving what the fuck is wrong with them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cant tell if the guy is being a troll or a fucking retard but judging by his username its a troll
SubredditDrama,not_removed,calling people smug this is why trump was elected s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it strikes me as kind of a look what you made me do thing its slowly setting in that we elected a joke and a lot of his supporters suddenly seem to really want that to be someone elses fault
SubredditDrama,not_removed,srd doesnt get to call anyone smug ever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,srd users complaining about smugness people come here to point and laugh at other redditors
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean it might be true that people who didnt like being called racist voted trump in its also probably true that plenty people voted in racist politicians in the south and even president nixon because they were afraid of what the civil rights movement meant does that discredit the civil rights movement or mean we should have stopped pursuing it fuck no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tolerant left
SubredditDrama,not_removed,methinks youre only bothered by the smugness because your guy didnt win i voted for hillary but since i didnt see it as the omg life and death good and evil battle that half of the internet did i dont really mind it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well maybe you all shouldnt have been so smug during the election the golden rule baby
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see it from sanders supporters as well its like anyone centerleft has to put up with being called a shill or corrupt or dated or told theyre stupid for playing identity politics for defending marginalized groupsbut as soon as they have something to say back its all like see your attitude is what caused this like we just watched a man insult his way to the top but we have to watch our language get fucking real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup and we are going to keep being smug about it for quite sometime and theres nothing you can do about it crying about it just makes me enjoy the collective trump supporter smugness even more you guys had months of mocking and being smug all of those biased media shills and experts were wrong despite their best efforts to push the election in their favor our turn now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is why trump was elected desu
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly the main thing running my head while reading the drama was nelson mandela is alive had a wtf moment for a few minutes there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,another country
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bleach
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bacon sammich
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but its useless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it makes sense to someone who has never even kissed a girl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nooooooooooo mod aboose
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my family does turkey and ham both fite me irl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like turkey so my wife cooks ham for me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see id probably eta accuse anyone who did eat ham on thanksgiving of being a communist unamerican and probably someone who would talk at the theater
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actually we did lol my aunt was called to her hospital at the last minute so my uncle had to bring in the turkey late by that time all our guests had chowed down on the ham and i was too stuffed for turkey
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look at his post history
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i saw this on bpt earlier and its my new favorite reddit image
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean its not wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,calling people smug this is why trump was elected you are the real smug s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like if you dont tolerate fascism youre the intolerant one or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,downvoted under the filter in less than minutes for pointing out the irony of this sub not liking smugness suggesting the election wasnt an epic battle between good and evil w e w e w l a d a d
SubredditDrama,not_removed,methinks you shouldnt be doing too much of that might pull a muscle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well nelson mandela will never die not on the internet at least
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes alive lol i was arguing the entire time thinking he died a couple decades ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,buahahahahahahahahahaha hey at least you got a good amount of karma from it p
SubredditDrama,not_removed,after school out back ill kick ur ass
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ham gravy amazing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like turkey either but my grandmother makes it and we cant say that we dont like it luckily she is a good enough cook that it isnt unbearable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like turkey either it aint got shit on the ottoman empire
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wish i can leave this site but its too addicting xd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no smug no smug youre the smug
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sorry but is this ironic because i cant tell
SubredditDrama,not_removed,landslide nice bait
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im taking the bait the dude got million votes less
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not how that word works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i take the bait because i am a shark dude is going to lose the popular vote by a hell of a lot and well see after the recounts but as it stands he won the ec by about votes spread across states if we would go by vote distribution per state that is the percent who voted democrat get that percent of the states electoral vote dude got less ec votes than hillary proof i made the spreadsheet myself but you can easily validate all the data by googling it for yourself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wrong wrong wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that was literally the meme i saw come out after the election several people parroting a definition of bigot which said it was a prejudice against people based on their opinions so youre the real bigots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of course thats wrong most people do laugh at sjws but a huge chunk of those people still voted for clinton but i just found it funny that suddenly srd has an issue with smugness now suddenly its problem lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,apparently trump won because sjws are calling innocent white men racists and xenophobic so we decided to stick it to them and vote for trump i dont know that many trump supporters but anecdotally this is completely true for the half dozen or so on my facebook these are college graduates young men in their midtolate with well paying white collar jobs in business medicine or technology and they are infuriated by the rhetoric they see from the left online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can you elaborate on that or do i even want to know ive seen that said many times but dont understand how that makes sense and would like to know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its really a load of bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hardcore vibe in that move yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a patriotic crisis is this post a joke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wouldnt be having a patriotic crisis im accepting us secrets other than youre fat fucks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,patriotic crisis you mean you didnt have a patriotic crisis over the fact that were the only major country without universal health care america sucks ass and has for a while so im glad this election opened your eyes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah freak out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol did you just try to insult me because i pointed out how funny it is that srd is whining about smugness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wouldve said isnt over yet but he actually died in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fight fight fight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hang on i need to eat some leftover turkey and ham to beef up get it beef up like meat we dont serve beef at thanksgiving tho were not heathens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gravy basically any thanksgiving food amazing tbqh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im so jealous of people with grandmas that can cook everyone has all these stories of their grandmas cookies and pies and my entire family just overcooks shit and never seasons anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,after a cursory glance at posting history im thinking its not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is pretty handy though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now account for the million illegal immigrants that voted and tell me who won and its irrelevant trump won pa by votes there is no recount in the world that is going to make up for that you could find maybe votes tops and thats being generous if its even that many ill be shocked without pa she cant win and shes not getting pa as far as distribution goes thats irrelevant because voters arent distributed theyre kept in their voting districts those districts percent trump if youre going to import illegals to flub elections try to put them in more places than major cities next time michigan is paper ballot only and has already been counted twice and still declared for trump seriously dude this is pathetic give it up you lost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no wrong no wrong youre the wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what dont you understand i have a few trump supporters on my fb ama or
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see the thing is i dont think thats true most people voted for him because he was the republican candidate and vaguely made the right noises about social wedge issues others voted for him because of his burn it all down antigovernment populism and some disenfranchised working class white voters voted for him because he promised them the moon on a stick i dont think a reactionary antipc attitude was a driving force more of a fringe concern of people who probably would have voted trump anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no i was telling a joke see because i was being smug in an argument about smugness ill be here all night ladies and gentlemen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh a decade off still im a bit jarred that he died so recently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but landslide is what like popular margin right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now account for the million illegal immigrants that voted just as soon as you have a nonbullshit source on that we can account for it i cant help but notice it doubled its all the way to six million now its amazing what numbers can do when you just make them up isnt it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as it stands he won the ec by about votes spread across states
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lean forward deep breath this is your moment donny show them what youre made of wrong got em lean back smugly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to qoute another user id like immigrants to participate in the us by immigrating legally fuck off racist this is what people are talking about when they say this is why trump was elected thats not to say that there arent racist trump supporters there are many people like you seem unable to differentiate another thing everyone in the ghetto is a waste of space crackhead racist white trash living in trailers are waste of space methheads sensible view thats the attitude of a lot of democrats its not just why trump got elected its an important grievance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you know any trump voters have you asked them why they voted the way they did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the missing of the voter turnout stepping in after the fight is over and spitting in the losers face yeah sjws did this children
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so like tons of people in loads of different countries at any one time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,agreed im still waiting for those aerial photographs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the number seems to go up every time the claim is made theres only around million illegals in the country so an argument that over half of them voted is something else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ok community college dropout lets do some math there are roughly voting districts in america trump won of them was that score congratulations but unfortunately for you youre going to need more than los angeles new york and broward county
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all hail president donny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the best part is that number somehow doubled in two weeks like not only are we just making shit up now as a culture but were finding ourselves dissatisfied with the lie and augmenting it almost immediately also what the hell kind of number is to million its either a number or double that number somewhere in that range draw your own conclusions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and those districts have of the economic power in this country not to mention a huge amount of the population land doesnt elect presidents its not counties its people but youre so obsessed with being stupid not even god can help you at this point there are million in new york city and only in the whole of wyoming and you want to tell me that winning wyomings counties should be worth more than winning just the one county of new york city try again when youre less of a fool and more educated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sniff
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which values accepting illegal immigration blaming cops over criminal violence silencing voices you dont like on campus putting regulations on our industry which means we cant compete internationally im curious as to which values have been shown false and which ones you just claim are ive asked many antitrumpers who have strong opinions like this to cite where he said whatever horrible thing you think he did so far none have been able to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,faggot what a shock coming from a lowenergy loweffort republican you havent left high school yet have you do those people not matter now see youre extraordinarily stupid are you advocating that one persons voice should matter more than anothers of course the farmers of this country matter but so do the factory workers and the bankers the tech companies and the artists those who live in cities and those who live in the countryside but i dont think youre intelligent enough to comprehend that so perhaps we should end this discussion before you give yourself an aneurysm only the people who blindly agree with me should be allowed to vote wow you managed to misinterpret absolutely everything i said because amazingly you really are that unintelligent i thought you were in high school before but this level of stupidity can only come from middleschoolers every single last citizen should vote in fact it should be mandatory to vote and everyones vote should count the same unless you know youd prefer some people like urbandwelling liberals to count as of everyone else would that be your utopia a place where nobody has a voice except for you sounds a lot like conservative freedom to me where dissenting ideas are oppressed as long as theyre presented from one not of the white male variety real people dont want to sit at the same table as you triggered little whiny ass stress doll needing temper tantrum throwing fucking nobodies oh yikes i really triggered you didnt i keep crying as america goes to shit ill sit on the sidelines and watch it burn trump is going to hurt the working class and the poor the most the very ones who elected him youre right the government is entirely republican everything from here on out is your fault and your problem you cant blame this on the democrats anymore toodles you adorable triggered little snowflake youre cute you know youre like an angry little kitten and i can keep poking you until you fall over and burst into tears i bet you were gritting your teeth as you wrote that last comment i could feel your prepubescent rage through the screen i cant wait until trump betrays you and you feel like nobody cares about you because youd be right nobody does
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you attract more flies with honey than vinegar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,go back to tumblr
SubredditDrama,not_removed,la la la i cant hear you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now whos triggered im not reading that

SubredditDrama,not_removed,its called actively seeking challenge if i dont want challenge whats the point of playing i wanna be the very best
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this popcorn has been ground up good thing snapshillbot caught it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey lastpingstanding thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because there is not enough drama to merit an srd submission please wait and see if things develop further or look for a subthread with more drama make sure youre linking with the proper context for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,poor title good find
SubredditDrama,not_removed,randroid is a goldmine for this kind of shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wish people would just be honest with their shitty opinions and say trans people are icky and they gross me out rather than try all that fake concern crap that no one falls for
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and yet people think letting these people change their gender is a better option than therapy what kind of therapy is he talking about does he think that licensed professionals are going to counsel people to not be transgender because thats not what we do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didthat guy just equate a sex change op with a depressed person committing suicide
SubredditDrama,not_removed,drewiepoodle fighting the good fight i see you brah youre killer on the same note isnt really too shocking especially for a trans woman on color and yes race is important here twoc deal with a lot of shit and are more likely to be poor have stds engage in risky illegal work face violence you name it theyre more likely to deal with it than other trans people if this pisses you off make a donation to your local lgbt health center in lalas name itll help the rest of the women out there survive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah yes the old trans people just need therapy claim honestly trans drama is always the same and never has any kindness or respect the past three posts weve had this week or so all have the same dynamic someone mentions a trans person someone else says that their identity is a psychological problem and should be addressed as such every time edit i truthfully wouldnt mind if trans drama was declared surplus this past week has shown us that reddit doesnt discuss the issue well and its pretty much always the same discussion in general im not a fan of surplus drama bring back trump drama but in view of the fact that reddit and rsrd dont discuss it well we could let it go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its always weird to see antitrans redpillers do they not realize their delusional philosophy was inspired by the writings of two trans women
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look at all these people comfortable with their assigned gender tell people who arent comfortable with their assigned gender how they should just automatically be comfortable with their assigned gender
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the metal heads from my high school can confirm never went to college though for more reasons than my music taste it blows my mind that theyre people who are so opinionated on topics they know nothing about transphobes especially think theyre educated on how we work when in reality being trans is fucking rough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuck the kind of people that would say that shit on a post about someone dying i dont have anything constructive to say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well of course transgender people need therapy anyone that has to talk to people in that post will need therapy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and yet people think letting these people change their gender is a better option than therapy from what my understanding of transitioning is that changing your gender is a serious thing to do but its not really life threatening if anything i mean did you even research this shit dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had absolutely no idea wiz had a sister very sad to find out like this my prayers go out to wiz and his family
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the drama could have been much worse in that thread to be honest she died with her mother by her side and the cause of death has not been revealed that leaves a lot of room for speculation if she died of a heart attack or of injuries sustained in a car accident that information probably would have been revealed so why the secrecy several members of alexis arquettes family were present when alexis died and there too no cause of death was revealed it was speculated that transitioning ultimately wasnt the answer for her depression she was unable to find love in life some said she already had hiv so she decided life wasnt worth living anymore this quote from vocativ is interesting according to surveys percent of the overall us population has selfreported a suicide attempt with that number climbing to between and percent for lesbian gay or bisexual respondents by comparison percent of trans or gender nonconforming people surveyed have attempted suicide i think when a trans person chooses to die its okay to discuss that because it brings attention to the epidemic of transgender suicidality the dialogue in the thread isnt really that bad with the exception of the guy who said this when asked how she died probably has something to do with her sex change you have to pop some serious drugs and do some complicated surgeries to make it happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,transgender people can just pop hormones like its candy i fucking wish takes a solid three days for my clinic to refill my testosterone because its a controlled substance every fuckin time i gotta put in a request for that never refills bucks a bottle too insurance wont cover it until i go to a years worth of therapy i dont even need sigh im gettin so sick of the trans discourse on reddit everyones a fucking psychologist when it comes to it well we should find a treatment ok done well we should find a different treatment bc blah blah fucking blah what do you propose doctor youve apparently studied this very thoroughly to just know that thousands of experts exploring decades of different treatments are just wrong smdh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,imagine if we could give depressed people a much higher quality of life merely by giving them cheap natural hormones i dont think theres a psychiatrist in the world who wouldnt celebrate that as one of the biggest mental health advances in a generation imagine if we could ameliorate schizophrenia with one safe simple surgery just snip snip youre not schizophrenic anymore pretty sure that would win all of the nobel prizes imagine that we could make a serious dent in bipolar disorder just by calling people different pronouns im pretty sure the entire mental health field would join together in bludgeoning anybody who refused to do that we would bludgeon them over the head with big books about the side effects of lithium really are you sure you want your opposition to accepting transgender people to be i think its a mental disorder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at least its just a minority better than that shitty post in rthedonald about the american college of pediatrics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its worth at least mentioning many trans people suffer from depression
SubredditDrama,not_removed,was it suicide transgender people have very high rates of suicide much higher than nornal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like the person who talks about trans people as having mental illness he does a great job of explaining that its a mental illness but people in society view mental illness as a negative and thats bad idk they explain it better than i can but i like that they explain that just because its a mental illness doesnt mean that people who have issues with the gender are wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,insightful reply and i appreciate you taking the time to write it i knew id get flack for the comment but this reply was worth it people need to grow the fuck up with regards to having a superior attitude towards those with mental illness i am not sure if this was a blanket statement or towards me i am not looking down on these people my outlook which can be misinformed is that mental illnesses are mainly hereditary genetics with some environmental influences if thats the case how can i fault them for that i am just calling it how i see it theres no hate or bigotry involved i hate when people say just calling it like i see it but that was honestly a pretty mature response
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt matter if she is trans either way he lost his sister that is not easy to deal with prayers for wiz family rip
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah the other khalifa i was thinking of mia not related to the topic at hand at all i hate porn movies that involve hijabis im not religiously offended rather it is so remarkably tacky i cringed rather than turned on imagine if the girl keeps screaming oh yeah fuck me hard daddy even before the dick is in at some point you will have to ask what is going on here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have nothing against but new studies have shown
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like when they are against gay marriage and try to say its becasue of religion or something like no if you care about religion youd really be fighting the extremely high divorce rate just admit you think homosexuality is icky and youre afraid of your son catching it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly this is true of all bigotry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was thinking this recently when i saw possibly the dumbest conspiracy ever about how half of the entertainment industry is actually trans people being controlled by the government for some reason it was one hell of a wall of text and all i could think was that just admitting you dont like trans people would be so much easier for everyone involved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hang on is this what people mean when they write about concern trolling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whenever someone comes across as bigoted i always try and draw out the real reason because once you can get them to admit that its way easier to get them to be empathetic and understanding of differences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but if they accept their bigotry for what it is they are proving the opposition right thats why they make excuses like im not racist but or im not homophobic but fuckem at the end of the day its only their opinion and everyone has one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the american special im not interested in ending segregation federal pushback is infringing on states rights guys but to be fair to america i think bigots need to keep their marketing positive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think they know any actual trans people so often if you ask them why they are squicked out they will end up describing a drag queen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there was a comic who made that joke about gays and marriage it basically boiled down to that and that people would have more respect for that argument than whatever else bullshit they went with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not sure if i was late to look at the thread but unless it was brigaded there seems to have been a decent number of people calling out the most ridiculous comments obviously i could have missed a bit but when i looked at the thread i found it slightly heartening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trans people are icky and they gross me out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also change their gender this guy has no fucking clue what hes talking about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people think letting these people change their gender is a better option than therapy because it literally is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre a therapist eve
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my licences professional therapist supported my decision its kinda part of the process its recommended by the dsm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes talking about hooking a car battery up to their fingers and turning it off when they say im no longer trans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that seems to be what they believe they think that theres some kind of therapy you can get that will make you no longer trans so it seems confusing and irresponsible to them that trans people would instead take hormonesget surgery they do not understand at all that its a permanent brain structure thing that you cant just be talked out of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the argument i see brought up a ton from people against accepting trans people is that they dont feel we should be promoting body modification as a means to fixing their internal struggle so i think most of the time therapy is a stand in for other treatment that doesnt change the physical biology of the person but that completely ignores that many trans people dont get reassignment surgery and find ways to change their outward look while retaining what makes themthemselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep and the worst part is there are so many people who still dont understand how stupid of this correlation is depression is simply more than just feeling bad it stays with you like a fucking parasite and it can mess with your shit on a daily basis sex changing or transitioning is something majorly different all together ugh i know people dont know this shit but its not that hard to learn about shit like this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i honestly can see the comparison and i dont think its that bad both can be seen as a tough condition that takes a lot to overcome that commenters bias is showing because he believes that being trans negatively impacts everyone around them and harmful to the person them self now there is usually a lot of stress surrounding sex changing that does effect everyone around a trans person but this is due to social stigmas there is no drug on the market that can change someones mind when they have an issue with their body even if wanting a sex change is a disorder people need to understand that getting a sex change operationhormone taking etc etc is an effective treatment with helping these people become happy it is not as negative as wanting to cutoff your hand because it doesnt feel like yours because wanting a sex change doesnt effect your ability to preform tasks they can still easily be a benefit to society also gunna ping you too ukingofsnipers i would appreciate your thoughts on what i said too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,more likely to be poor have stds engage in risky illegal work face violence i would think being related to wiz khalifa would greatly reduce some of these risks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes drewiepoodle is the real mvp im saving that list of professional groups that endorse transitioning for later because its amazing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,drewiepoodle is the best one of my all time favorite redditors
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why would you make a donation in porn star mia khalifas name his sisters name was lala
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you forgot apache attack helicopter lulz posts that always get gilded yes thank you for completely dismissing everything about these issues with the laziest repost jobs ever kids and adults just need to suck it up stop getting utis because they refuse to use government mandated bathrooms and realize that their precious helicopter identities are nonexistent because reddit has decided that they are really helicopters and should get over it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i honestly wouldnt mind if trans drama was declared surplus yeaaaah im with you here every time i see a post about it i feel tempted to read it and it always brings me down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trans people do need therapy in order to help deal with these assholes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as though the doctors involved were saying well there are two options therapy which will completely cure you and fix your feeling of being in the wrong body or surgery which is dangerous and complicated so weve opted for surgery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its obviously a common source of intolerance but the lack of any and all meaningful interaction with trans people is much more of a problem for their community to gain acceptance and rights than say gay people who are far more numerous and widespread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it works so well for all sorts of people just ask mike pence fire up the electrodes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think that antitrans or transphobic people whatever youd want to call them have narrowed in on two or three arguments that are both somewhat inoffensive and somewhat difficult to contradict directly this is a classic pattern with bigots racists in the were very upfront about being racists and against blacks by the theyd learned instead to couch everything as a cultural issue its about black on black crime and the inner city and all that shit the key thing ot remember here is that the bigots arent targeting people who know their bigots their targeting people who are either on the fence or have no real prior exposure to the issue i bet a lot of young kids get taken in by the they need therapy argument because they simply dont know better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope at least that some people are learning each time the topic comes up and gets rehashed its a new area for a lot of people and hopefully much of the current conflict is just ignorance which will be overcome with time in the linked thread there were far more people who were informed and on the side of trans people than not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someone else says that their identity is a psychological problem and should be addressed as such well it is isnt it i mean if you experience notable gender dysphoria you should treat it like a mental illness and get treatment for it which often is transitioning edit unless by psychological problem you should be treated by anything but body modification in which case youre right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,redpillers have yet to realize anything about anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the matrix is actually a film about being trans coming out and transitioning
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they believe it is something to be cured rather than something to be addressed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my ex is trans and it absolutely breaks my heart watching the shit he goes through i got like of it just from dating a trans person and i find that rough to deal with anyone in that position can understand the suicide rate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also therapy is a part of it not therapy to make them no longer trans but therapy to help the transition and the depression that comes along with gender dysphoria
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in my province it can take almost a year of gender therapy before you get the okay to start hrt its not a decision that is made lightly by any means some places have informed consent clinics which are a lot less strict but its still not easy you have to fight to transition a bit more than what i think its necessary after watching someone go through it however i actually think it should be a bit easier to transition than it currently is where i live at least ninjaedit also no its not dangerous the surgeries have the dangers that surgeries naturally do but thats literally it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it so thoroughly pisses me off to read a headline about how someone who happens to be lgbt died because i know i just know some douchebag is trying to politicize it and trying to push his trans people are actually mentally ill agenda makes me want to puke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah that was some bland drama tbh one guy doesnt think transgender people should go through with the physical sex change therapy and one guy arguing semantics about what a mental illness is i rate this drama because it was some light arguing but i didnt go away feeling mad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i saw the age i assumed it was suicide but it feels like a crass direction of thought right now only slightly less than assuming it was related to sexual reassignment surgery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant handle rthedonald hypocrisy in other hate subs they are upfront about their hate i hate them back but thanks for the honesty for rthedonald they were all like how trump is most progressive prolgbt candidate there is just because held a rainbow flag as soon as trump pulled back obamas policies on protecting trans students they were all like when did we say that trans people are mentally retarded and rapists fucking hell man how can they even live with themselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for anyone who doesnt already know the american college of pediatricians is a conservative antilgbt org that was created in reaction to the legitimate american academy of pediatrics supporting gay adoption as perfectly fine for kids the former is a political group with members the latter is an actual medical association with members
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i post there sometimes so i might be biased but hiphopheads tends to have a pretty low tolerance for homo and trans phobia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,constantly being subject to bigotry and violence will do that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but its not a mental illness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats just a trivial point which adds nothing to the discussion physically handicapped persons sometimes go through extremely invasive surgeries where metal rods are inserted inside their bones because thats the best treatment available yet nobody complains about how they should just only do physical therapy and how surgeries are dangerous and its really not walking if you use titaniumreinforced bones
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tfw you start grandstanding about porn in a thread about someone that died
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im way out of the loop for whatever is going on here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what is going on here exactly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look man if you watch porn and theres never a point where you ask wtf is going on you arent watching the right porn and do you not know about foreplay its not all about the dick
SubredditDrama,not_removed,links to voat post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i swear to god i had an annoying argument with a guy on an rcreepy post about serial killers and porn he basically said well there are a lot serial killers involved with porn cue people saying porn doesnt make people serial killers which he responds with i never said porn makes people serial but a bunch of reasons why porn is bad and that it may cause people to have serial killer or rape fetishes it is possibly the worst thing ive seen people do promote a casual link between two things then jump to i didnt explicitly say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im all for gays gettin married but why cant they just do it in secret and not influence normal people does it matter if the government labels their relationship im not being offensive im just saying i never want to have to interact with or think about gay relationships
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yea gay dudes are fucking disgustingtheir chiseled features and sweat glistening off of their perfect muscles and that fucking gross chest hair you just wanna bury yourself in because it makes you feel safetotally fucking gross
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you say that but ive encountered multiple people who are trying to fight the divorce rate and theyre terrifying the most common proposed solution is that a woman would require her husbands approval to get a divorce
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the catholic church says that homosexual acts are wrong the catholic church also says that contraception divorce and fornication are wrong guess which of these four is the one that catholics are spending more time preaching against
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also when they vote for candidates who are known to cheat on their wives
SubredditDrama,not_removed,first they came for the frogs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how do you get them to admit the real reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,opinions are like assholes everyone has one and they all stink
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a pretty liberal person but even i dont understand the difference between body dysmorphia and transgenderism it doesnt gross me out ive watched my fair share of shemale porn but i just dont see how it isnt different from other mental maladies concerning the body
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats fine that if you believe that just keep that shit to yourself since other people being trans doesnt affect you in any way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you are icky and you gross me out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yknow ive been a man this past winter but im thinking about changing to a woman im ready for a change and maybe when fall rolls around again ill go back to being a man so i can have facial hair to keep my face warm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am worked at the masters level for years and then went back for my doctorate im abd hoping to become licensed as a psychologist in the next year i currently do trauma therapy with children and teens who have been abused however my primary area of interest is addictive behaviors specifically eating disorders
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly its part of the apas httpswwwapaorgpracticeguidelinestransgenderpdf
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they think that theres some kind of therapy you can get that will make you no longer trans when in fact its that therapy thats often required to get hormonessurgery so im really lost though im guessing theyre talking more conversion therapy which uhh has kind of easily been proven to be garbage and massively detrimental to mental health
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the problem is that its really just something they use to justify their bigotry they dont want to learn about it because then theyd lose their excuse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i respectfully disagree on the basis point that the commenter is simply feigning ignorance there are so many people who actually go through the tranistion and actually really have a better life they are obviously more outgoing its not a negative but obviously he could had taken a look more into the situation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,true i was speaking generally
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ayfkm i thought the article said mia thanks for the correction
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is so deep into the meta that i honestly cant even follow what youre trying to say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the demographics of reddit should be the generation most comfortableeducatedtolerant of trans people too just goes to show how much ignorance is out there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im here to bring you back up have a great day friend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no kidding its like cancer treatments all pretty far from ideal but its not like weve got anything better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the lack of any and all meaningful interaction with trans people is much more of a problem for their community to gain acceptance and rights yeah rorty used to argue that narratives change peoples hearts far more than legislation hearing that your beliefs cause other people to suffer is vital empathy corrupts abstract persecution or cruel conceptions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exposure is just so so important to fighting bigotry theres a reason the major cities tend to lean liberal i grew up on a religious rural community and i wasnt so transfriendly like i was never the angry violent type of transphobic but i was very dismissive and mocking when you never meet a certain type of person all you have to go on are stories that pass through the conservative filter youre acting on warped perspectives through the wackiness of life i end up moving to the city dated a trans girl for a while and through her i hang out with more trans people and well ive been pretty militantly protrans since its easy to hate fear or judge someone you dont know someone you dont understand once you start forming real human connections thats hard to keep up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you saying that pence is trans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i want to be a dragon well good thing dragons arent real then truthfully i dont care about what these people do but to ingrain this fucked up culture into our society and promote it into young minds of children and make them think that its a legitimate choice in life is fucking ridiculous this sounds awfully familiar to the gays are pushing their ideology down our kids throats fuck off bigot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in all seriousness this is the type of shit that pisses me off about the typical gay culture if you really dissect this fuck hes a typical bullshit artist that pretends to be an intellectual and level headed journalist when really he is just a fake ass pussy who cant get anyone to fuck him in the ass its a disgrace that this scum bag is allowed to be on tv i am quoting euro lmfao nice concern trolling mate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just remember that being trans isnt the same as having gender dysphoria gender dysphoria is a disorder about distress not gender identity and not all trans people experience dysphoria being trans isnt considered a psychological problem that requires treatment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no there is a pretty big distinction between dysphoria being a legitimate issue that they have to deal withthrough transitioning whatever that may mean for an individual and saying their identity itself is a psychological problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shit dude the matrix is living life the way your gender was assigned the red pill is realizing youre trans it totally is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to add to this remember the character from the first film originally switch was supposed to be female in the matrix and male in the real world or vice versa remember morpheus says how they appear in the matrix the awakened people who plug back in was how they viewed themselves or something like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats sad i have a friend who was taking his currently his preferred nomenclature i always ask to be respectful hrt for mtf and said he never felt better in his life then he had to quit as he could afford it anymore and hasnt been able to take it in a long time and last time we talked he mention he would be happy again if he could just get back on his path of getting transitioned from mtf then you have people like my sister who i love but refuses to acknowledge our own cousin as a male and still refers to him as her even when his own momma refers to him the way he his his life is hard enough making the change as a teenager he doesnt need his cousins judging him especially when weve literally been there his whole life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kind of like homosexuality use to be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep im trans and dealing with my own demons daily i want to kill myself but cant bring myself to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly it sucks i just really hope none of them end up with trans kids or even gay kids for that matter theyre never gonna be comfortable with anything outside the norm i especially dislike the ones who think their anecdotes about playing with dolls when they were little and still growing up to be a healthy happily married white male one of them actually said suddenly mean that trans kids dont exist or that their story is even relevant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not convinced they know what the t in lgbt stands for to be honest
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fun fact internet spaceship games have stricter regulations on impersonating persons or groups than the us
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wonder if being so intentionally misleading ever gives them pause
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah was gonna mention that but hey the american college of pediatrics sounds very official so the transphobes are all over it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,generally serious issues and stuff casual homophobia and transphobia is still thrown around a bit but it is still very decent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mental illness is not a good term anyway dysphoria is antonym for euphoria i think it better reflects the nature of the condition because it does not have same connotations of irrationality as mental illness does
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pretty good actually selfrighteousness is way overrated having that big stick up your ass is actually very uncomfortable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reminded me to check what voats google results are no more vniggers or vfatpeoplehate but the pedo boards are still front and center funnily enough its their pizzagate board and youngladies board soooo one board to trying to find pedos right above their board for pedos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,links to image hosted on slimg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,links to trump tweet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,th worst thing is that porn is full of endemic sexual and physical abuse manipulation drug use manipulating people to get addicted laborwage problems and bad treatment against actresses but all of that is completely ignored because they dont give a shit about the real problems in porn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tell him that video games create mass murderers and watch that logic train turn right around
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that shit is so goddamn lazy its the kind of thing a smartass thirteen year old would think was good arguing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hate to be that person but i think you meant causal link not casual link only pointing it out because it kind of makes a big difference in your last sentence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hm rcreepy looks slightly better than i remember did their mods start doing their jobs since i left
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you my mom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but the gays cant raise kids which is what marriage is for also they shouldnt be able to adopt children because theyre not married and im offended at the idea that sterile couples shouldnt be allowed to marry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah real uggos like zachary quinto matt bomer and alan cumming grosssss s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they probably also have strong feelings about the plight of women in the arab world if theyre anything like the ones i know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the most common proposed solution is that a woman would require her husbands approval to get a divorce but not viseversa
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in the us probably contraception right now tbh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is this a trick question contraception duh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actually the pope has come out and said being gay is ok obviously he said he doesnt believe they should get married but he came out and said its perfectly normal to be gay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wedgie them until they admit theyre gay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not a psychologist so i cant talk about root causes but transitioning to female or male doesnt affect your ability to live a healthy and productive life other dysmorphic stuff like being insanely underweight or wanting to remove limbs does
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know enough beyond gender disphoria though even some quick wikipediing should suffice but ill give a quick rundown it presents rather differently to body dysmorphic disorder is highly persistent and is usually greatly eased with transition almost always actually its a ridiculously successful treatment with bdd attempts to change the perceived flaw directly like that are usually not enough so they will often resort to increasingly severe measures to try to fix it which when we get into plastic surgery after a certain point it ends up doing more harm than good it does respond to therapy though perhaps combined with meds when its linked with anxiety or depression some trans individuals can also have bdd probably more commonly than general population but its still fairly unusual body integrity identity disorder where people feel the need to amputate otherwise healthy body parts might have some linkages though little study has been done compared to gender dysphoria which had been studied for many decades now current theories for both suggest at least partial causes in the part of the brain that maps the body for trans people the idea would be that their brain map is that of the opposite sex for biid that theyre lacking mapping for say the right arm or whatever again though this is super speculative at this point and even if they do turn out to be similar the ethical guidelines might not necessarily be the same genital reconstructive surgery is fairly major amputating healthy limbs is a whole other level still anyway do some searching on all and you should be able to get a better understanding of the differences than im able to provide or if you want to ask more about gender dysphoria specifically im willing to answer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on that train of thought how vastly different would society be if humans could naturally transition back and forth between sexes like certain species of fish or reptile it would just be normal to have an alpha fratboy dudebro settle down to be a wife and mother or a teenage girl grow up to be a nfl linebacker
SubredditDrama,not_removed,up until recently i was dating a trans guy when asked what he was looking forward to most when he finished transitioning his answer was beard
SubredditDrama,not_removed,orlando
SubredditDrama,not_removed,addictive behaviors specifically eating disorders doc i dunno how to get myself under control just yesterday i had like ten grilled cheeses in one binge i put everything on those guys cheddar ham like a cup of ketchup on the side thats a melt ssorry you put ham in it its a melt you ate ten melts also replace your ketchup with this eve scribbles on her prescription pad what the fuck is ajvar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we know that all youre really doing is brainwashing people people to serve you and your sick mod friends we know what you mods are like do i need the s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn thats impressive kudos to you dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,basically the apache attack helicopter meme is used any time someone dares question gendersex issues on reddit especially if they dont fit the neat male female manwoman sexgender identity roles reddit is getting better but it still gets reposted anytime theres the slightest whiff of university sjw tumblr aspects to it unfortunately its gotten better because the new administration has basically proven the point that issues that transgendered people face safe spaces identity politics etc were valid issues the whole time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its really sad i mean all you have to do is be mildly curious about a subject and you can google it and youd learn a little sometimes it just boils down to someone having a little panic that they might be friends withattracted to a trans person and it seems so foreign and scary to them its a real bummer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the demographics of reddit is brogressive they want free weed but fuck minorities
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the transphobic posts are widely downvoted they always are posts like these always remind me of the goodness in reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the question becomes how we can highlight trans narratives pop culture can help eg laverne cox but unless its highly personal like a trans family member or friend its easy to dismiss particularly if youre already ignoring libtard propaganda hard enough coming out as gay or trans in conservative communities but actually transitioning sheeeit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,transhuman like cruz
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not saying he is im just saying we should probably have someone check his genitals before he enters any public bathroom just to be safe also op was alluding to his support of electroshock therapy to cure being gay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to expand on that the point is that once you are happy with your gendersexual identity you are no longer disordered saying trans people are just mentally ill implies that a person is mentally ill on a fundamental level in a way which is inherent and untreatable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i remember reading a really fascinating article analyzing the matrix as a transgender coming out film and every bit of it made sense even little details like agent smith always referring to neo as mr anderson as an analogue to intentional misgendering and the way neo had a to live a dual life pretending to be someone hes really not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry to be nosy is your trans friend on reddit i have a shitload of references and charities and shit to kickstart a mtf transition for low income and im always willing to share
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mean still is our vice president endorses electroshock therapy to cure homosexuality
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey im just some dude on the internet with a very very very basic idea of what youre going through but for what its worth just cause the bigots are loud right now doesnt mean theyre right theyre certainly not and theres nothing wrong with you apart from some absolutely terrible luck when you were being formed ive seen the emotional changes that a trans person can go through while transitioning so this is the only thing that i can say with absolute confidence it can and will get better trust me take care of yourself and do whatever it takes to be happy be it cutting off bigots leaving toxic relationships friends or romantic or finding a new endocrinologist if theyre putting off your transitioning at the end of the day youre the only permanent person in your life no matter what happens everyone else is transient so do whatever it takes for you to be happy and fuck what people who are against it say this started out small and i kinda obsessed over it until it turned into this mess of a wall of text sorry about that i just hope you have a nice life and a good day and someone you love gives you a hug cause you deserve it also please dont kill yourself random internet person would be sad and i guarantee others would too if youre having a hard time finding another reason not to i know that can happen sometimes theres a free one that you can use
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre implying theyre not soulless cretins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess but gender dysphoria is a mental illness its just that being trans isnt gender dysphoria
SubredditDrama,not_removed,remember its only epepephibiphila when we do it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the pizza is coming from inside the server
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i got pizzagate and youngladies jesus christ when i googled voat what a nice group of people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what is that site ive seen it quite a bit lately
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont disagree with any of that porn and sex workers deserve a strong defense of their labor rights which includes being treated like decent human beings above all else however i will say that for some people pornsex addiction is a very real thing which has serious negative impacts on their daily lives i dont think the unrealistic nature of most modern porn and the ease of access really helps those people im not arguing for banning porn or anything silly like that but i feel like it is constructive to acknowledge that some people have serious issues with their porn habitsaddictions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean you just describe problems with acting in general
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the exact same thing trump used to get elected so its clearly not a bad strategy in certain cases
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not sure what you mean im pretty sure i meant casual as in they point it let in a way to suggest two things are only a little related but still related nonetheless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a married lady who cant carry a kid to term and i love saying so my marriage with my husband is invalid to you when they bring up the gayscantbreedmarriageisforbreeding argument especially in person so i can see their faces fall
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we better start monitoring those straight couples to make sure theyre all fertile and actively trying to reproduce and not just cheating the government out of tax money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,matt bomer is too handsome he creeps me out its like hes in the uncanny valley of attractiveness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mmm cumming indeed i mean disgusting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,alan cumming really i mean whatever floats your boat but really
SubredditDrama,not_removed,western feminism is wrong because arab women have it worse i guess the only progressive solution is knock western women down a peg or two s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a split between people who think that would only apply one way and people who think it should be both but both groups think that women should stay in the home so its still quite patriarchal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the catholic church has always been fine with people having a gay orientation but not with them having sex with someone of the same sex and he didnt actually say that is okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know you are but what am i gets em every time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this would be beyond cool id like to be a foot tall dude sometime and then a foot girl then a muscley rock climbing dude and a female gymnast definitely staying away from being a female when it comes time to have kids though so much pain
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that thought is explored somewhat in some of the culture novels by ian banks if you happen to be interested
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im prescribing you a steak welldone and a confit byaldi which is not the same as ratatouille
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ajvar is nicer than ketchup
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do i need the s nah besides brainwashing isnt exactly my strong suitalthough i guess since i do cbt cognitive behavioral therapy it can be seen as changing the way people think spooky
SubredditDrama,not_removed,issues transgendered people face are valid issues but i think people exaggerate how many transgender people there are in america or even in the world and turn it into a problem here on reddit in the us they make up of the population around million people the way people consider trans issues on here youd be led into thinking that they make up a good example of this is the bathroom issue where people couldnt agree on which restroom trans people were allowed into however this only truly became an issue when it was waved in everyones faces without an argument surrounding it trans people would just go into whatever bathroom they pleased and most people wouldnt bat an eye its just not something worth concerning ourselves over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,still im confident it can change faster than youd think here in the netherlands when gay marriage was legalized fifteen years ago it wasnt completely uncontroversial today barely of the population has any issues with homosexuality at all as long as the education is there the next generation will have an entirely different outlook
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sure but at this point the site is big enough that the american segment of users should be a reasonable representation of the yo male population that means theyre largely brogressive too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly in my experience trans folks in general care more about being perceived as the gender they identify as than going through any sort of intensive surgeries sure there are tons who want bottom surgeries but most are completely fine with whatever parts they were born with as long as other people dont hold it against them many are completely fine with hormone treatment and nothing more with exception with top surgeries for trans men with noticeable breast size binders can be a pain in the ass the needing therapy to deal with other assholes part is way more accurate and if assholes didnt give so much credence to having the right genitals or giving so much importance to passing i feel like tons more trans people would forgo bottom surgeries im sure it would still happen but just less frequently source im trans and nearly everyone im close with is trans and i nary hear a peep about genital surgeries especially in younger generations everyones mostly cool about their junk as long as everyone else is and no one gives them shit for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,relevant username
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you look at actual neighborhood breakdowns the areas of the city that actually generate money vote r ah yes which is exactly why in the new york republican primaries there were about the same number of votes in manhattan and staten island in each despite manhattan having approximately four times the population and before you try to claim that the rich areas of manhattan must have made up all of those votes let me just stop you from looking even dumber than you already do and link to the neighborhood by neighborhood breakdowns vs please point out all those rich areas that had more republican votes ill wait all those rich people fleeing manhattan to live on staten island
SubredditDrama,not_removed,k
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i always have to prove which party im registered to vote for in order to get my sweet sweet medicaid maybe just maybe a lot of poor people vote democrat because the party offers or seems to offer to better serve their needs than republicans because thats how elected officials are meant to do things promote policies that benefit their constituents could a lot more reform be done absolutely and there are groups and politicians working to change that i really doubt you and i would agree on the best solutions to those institutional problems but itd be really nice if we could have a reasonable discussion about these issues without all this blackandwhite yoursidemyside bullshit nonsense unless youre in a cult living on a compound youre probably a part of at least one type of community full of people with beliefs different from yours your neighborhood maybe your family your church your place of work youve likely worked toward and succeeded at common goals with people who think differently from you and are different from you i dont think politics should really be any different tldr at the end of the day we both just want whats best for ourselves our families and our communities we can and definitely do disagree about what that means but its still a common goal that unites us
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the burden of proof is generally on the one making the claim so prove yourself right

SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah not sure how thats supposed to work on us lesbians but i dont really want to think about it either
SubredditDrama,not_removed,finding a new endocrinologist if theyre putting off your transitioning ive yet to transition a lot due to weight i was pretty overweight last i weighed myself i dont want to start hormones until ive reached a weight im comfortable at and can be healthy at and then because im living at home and deep in the closet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats wrong in calling it just dysphoria mental illness is not a good umbrella term being trans is not dysphoria as i think anyone here agrees
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it still boggles my mind that they try that defense as if everyone is just totally like oh yeah no fucking year olds is totally fine and cool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some people think that imgur censors posts especially those supporting trump so they made their own imgur
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from what i can gather its the voat of imgur
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pornography actresses face far far far worse issues than nonporn actresses do this isnt dismissing the problems with either but porn actresses face way more predatory behavior and situations directly stemming from the job itself there have been many accounts of women being pressured into scenes or situations they didnt want to do using various manipulative tactics porn actresses are some of the most vulnerable workers out there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think it really mattered what trump said as long as he said it confidently he didnt get elected based on his ideas he got elected because scared people love a strongman but i take your point it surely can be an effective practice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well you said that he made comments about porn causing serial killer or rape fetishes when explaining his first comments about the connection between porn and serial killers saying that thing a causes or helps cause thing b is a causal link im not saying what you said was wrong casual can work too i just thought causal made more sense given the rest of what you said
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gay people should be able to get married but they shouldnt receive special attention from the government but if they didnt get the special attention then they would never have been able to get married yeah but uh its turning people gay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,looking at matt bomer is like looking into the sun if the sun had a perfect nose
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i honestly didnt know how to describe it but youve hit the nail on the head ive been trying to get back into white collar and i just couldnt do it because of matt bomer for some reason lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just by looking at those eyes i can tell that he sold his soul to look like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have had a crush on anderson cooper for so long his eyes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpimgurcomavlnpp eta
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people who dismiss western feminism because middle east probably never heard of marjane satrapi and malala yousafzai
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it would be an interesting to see if things like gender stereotypes and roles would be more or less entrenched due to being able to go back and forth between sexes would professional sports just be male only competitions since many of the athletes could have started as women anyways and just shifted to being men perform at higher levels
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah excession has this as a huge plot point because two character get each other pregnant at the same time also thats just a really good book in general
SubredditDrama,not_removed,welldone im starting to question your credentials
SubredditDrama,not_removed,steak welldone what is this monster hunter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess since i do cbt um just so you know theres a different meaning for cbt so maybe you should expand that acronym just to avoid the confusion that i had
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt matter how many or how few people there are they need help and support as much as anyone else does waved in everyones faces is missing the point it is a public issue especially for kids and teenagers who are too young to recognize that bullying is bullshit and too vulnerable to know how to protect themselves kids have very few choices in how they present themselves and going outside of that makes them easy targets they also lack the ability to move change schools or easily create identities until theyre adults chances are most kids know the same kids they met in kindergarten as theyll meet their senior year changing a gender in school often means changing very openly around people that youve known maybe most of your life and these people arent all that mature themselves changing bathrooms alone in that environment would be a huge deal because classmates would easily see that change
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while i agree that the bathroom issue should absolutely be a complete non issue the level of discrimination million americans face that leads to extremely high suicide rates is a fucking tragedy that shouldnt be trivialized certainly not because they only make up of the population that seems like a total non sequitur
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as for the whole bathroom thingits just a cultural tradition that we even have gendered restrooms we could easily just have unisex ones some people seem to have a real complex about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we hyperventilate over issues that affect far smaller portions of the population from ceo pay to lifetime caps on health insurance and who exactly is waving this issue in peoples faces im reminded of those perennial stories about how political correctness gets christmas scenes on public property shut down its always because a jewish atheist sikh etc group wants to put in their own display town legislators shuts them down but leaves the christian scene a lawsuit is filed and legislators shut it all down cue headline and conservative talking point yes trans people have mostly used the bathroom they felt comfortable in was the issue waved in peoples faces or was existing bigotry put into law conservatives decry any discussion of racism or inequality as politically correct overreaction when talking about the problem is claimed to the the problem you know youve found people who are deeply uninterested in finding real solutions it all comes back to the political expedience of bigotry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i find it surprising that people even use public bathrooms just piss piss everywhere
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not going to take a side but to be fair he is responding to someone else making a different claim about why cities lean liberal the big difference is that he chose a controversial opinion for this sub and one that kind of derails the conversation in the thread but so it goes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh come on hes bad enough to not have to make stuff up about him here clearly half rodent half human
SubredditDrama,not_removed,doragonamerican
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt see this thank you ill speak to him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont mind at all in fact please do if i could continue being nosy what country is he in just will help getting relevant info dont worry if you dont wanna answer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everyone knows lesbians are immune to electricity so you should be fine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where there is a will there is a way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i definitely see the problem ftm hormones not educated on mtf can cause weight gain and inhibit weight loss the best i can suggest is picking up a personal trainer if you can afford it if not i use the nike training app and it definitely helps you dont need equipment or anything either if nothing else its a great place to start the being closeted part hurts i know how terrible it feels to be in that position im far from a gender therapist but from my limited experience i suggest coming out to close friends if you havent already and just slowly expanding who knows until youre more comfortable with your position in life and correct people when they use the wrong pronouns i know its hard at first but its your right as a human being to feel good in your body enforce correct pronouns make sure other do too it helps dysphoria immensely i promise being a young trans person is very difficult youre already going through a really difficult phase of life and then you have all of that thrown on top of it youre not alone in your struggle though look for free or inexpensive gender therapy find some support groups there are so many resources that you can access and i promise that theyll help you feel better edit i should say i have no idea your age or gender so a lot of this is basically just guessing but i hope it helps as im just addressing what i know from my relationship to an year old ftm trans person who is living at home
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im just suggesting that dysphoria might not be a good term to use as its already used as a category of mental disorder we could try to get the dsm to change their terminology and reclaim the word but that seems unlikely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just gonna leave this here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsmyoutubecomwatchvnzskuvagyjq whoopi literally said this on national television and there was no backlash
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wasnt it that they remove the fph type posts i thought that was the genesis of slimgur and it just kinda caught on with the shit subs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,omfg the victim complex is so strong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,made by or on behalf of fatpeoplehate so thats the best description of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one interesting thing ive read is that reputable nonpredatory companies do before and after hardercore scenes is interviews with the performers exploring what the performers are comfortable with safe words etc and then afterwards how they felt about the experience im not sure how true that is but it makes sense that a company trying to do things the right way would do that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and much of that is because of the type of person that gets involved with porn in the first place many many of the actresses come from trauma filled upbringings whether it be a deadbeat alcoholic dad or a touchy uncle or a verbally abusive mom thats been married seven times as much as many of the girls want to claim to be strong independent women theyre hiding a dark past of trauma those situations wire the brain and change it and they are drawn to the industry then they get there and encounter the same types of emotional problems that they grew up with ie being forced to do a scene they dont want to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i really dont want to be the but what about men guy but why do you keep talking specifically about actresses
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i mean i dont want to start a politics discussion its just a really clear recent example of it im not saying x but y everyone knows this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if it was causal he would have been more direct he wasnt direct which is everything im complaining about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes in the nice guys and hes pretty good in it definitely worth a watch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,silver fox
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i want to paint my bedroom anderson cooper eyes blue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fascinating but maybe in that case gender wouldnt be as big of a deal maybe itd be like a police officer or emt putting on a uniform to go to work a scuba diver wearing oxygen to breathe underwater just switching out your parts for parts that work better in that situation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we should argue about it please dont hurt me i actually like medium rare for most cuts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh jeez i didnt know thats how people shortened cock and ball torture thats what you mean right ahem i mean cognitive behavioral therapy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive seen actual unisex bathrooms before the earth didnt stop spinning hell didnt freeze over they were just bathrooms like every other bathroom in the world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,question when you say unisex do you mean a third bathroom in addition to male and female or just one bathroom for everyone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont have any answers lol but ill admit i wonder about this as well my sibling is transitioning and from experience with medical and such i wonder if cost is a factor at least in the us the medical system is a nightmare here even for simple things and i always got the impression surgery is on the todo list but is just waiting until a lot of money is saved up to be able to make it happen there were definitely billing issues over therapy and hormone treatments and even by comparison i have a lot of pretty routine medical costs that have me doing paperwork so confusing i can only take it in small doses i cant imagine having to deal with the paperworkbilling situation while also fighting off the actively obstructionist bureaucracy at times
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think your right i dont want bottom surgery but i believe im the outlier in the community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,complains about biased news links to breitbart
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes actually a rat werehuman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,edit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that explains why my cell phone keeps resetting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so far ive started properly dieting and im walking miles everyday just takes time to properly lose all this weight i need to hit the gym i suggest coming out to close friends if you havent already got no friends had some but then after high school family moved to bumfuck nowhere texas so im more or less alone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but thats my point at least to me illness is much more negative term than dysphoria disorder is more neutral than mental illness as many disorders cant be cured in the way most people would cure an illness i think its more accurate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,save yourselves yeesh i feel like i need a hot shower bleach and steel wool to feel clean again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow this is really telling and somewhat unsurprising given the pedophile obsession
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao is voat currently in a fight between conspiracy theorists and pedophiles that site is like a parody of itself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i actually do recall there being backlash though perhaps not the amount it deserved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they doxed some imgur emloyees and so of course imgur took their shit down so fph made slimgr so they could be shitty without consequence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what do you mean reddit censors posts with no shame imgur is tandem to reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right but thats come a long long way than in the past used to be theyd just harass andor drug up andor slippery slope well well do some easier scenes first some chick until she went along with it it can be all but impossible for some people to say no when theyre already in that situation in a room full of dudes on a budget and zero support right then and there from anyone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you really dont but you really just did my original point is that these conversations about problems in porn often erase women from the topic and then people get squicked about humanizing these women my points about women in porn was because male porn stars do face similar issues but its not even close to what women face there are other issues like gay vs straight men in porn as well as race issuessomething im not as familiar with along with aids spreading through the industry back in the day and still sometimes has flare ups but women have been preyed upon by predators in this industry for decades and its something that doesnt affect men as much even things like the industryproduction side have huge issues for women where they get locked out of those positions and higher wage earnings than their male counterparts i also know the issues concerning women in the porn industry more than i do for men its an industry that chews up men and women but women way way way more than men do you are more than welcome to talk about the issues that men face in the industry i highly suggest rmenslib if you want to discuss it in a real sub and not just in srd but me specifically talking about women exclusively does not mean i am erasing men from the topic by default
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not necessarily the way you say something doesnt always change what youre saying he was implying and beating around the bush because he had nothing to support his ideas instead of being direct and explicit with his opinion but his words at least in the way you presented them still meant thing a causes thing b
SubredditDrama,not_removed,odd enough my parents like gay marriage but hates marijuana because they feel like it affects them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the foxiest
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like arguing with therapists what with their mindfuckery and all you and your profession are saints and i wouldnt be here without you guys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,medium rare hah why dont you just eat coal i cook my steak the way its meant to be done five minutes on my radiator salt pepper serve
SubredditDrama,not_removed,both cbts are effective at changing the way you see things so they have that in common at least
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep thats exactly what i meant the wonderful world of acronyms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i find they tend to be cleaner than sexsegregated bathrooms for whatever reason too this is not a downside at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reported to the mods for personal attacks prove me wrong i just linked an article explaining why dems win in cities it supports my thesis about welfare babies and entitlements all you did was send fake news that isnt even loading on my screen looks like you need to take another debate class
SubredditDrama,not_removed,does this count as elder scrolls fan fiction
SubredditDrama,not_removed,werehuman technically were already means man so this term is redundant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so does he never morph back out of his were form or what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey i know its not quite as far as doxxing but you may want to take these posts off a public sub and just pm them over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,calories in vs calories out lots of shit goes on in life so work on the things that you can control is the gym i suggest according to my second google search they have them in texas mostly just because they include access to a personal trainer with your subscription that brings me back to my finding support groups thing i have general anxiety and severe ocd i know how difficult and terrifying it is to meet people and find friends going somewhere where you are guaranteed to have at least one thing in common with everyone is so great for meeting people and making friends and the best part is that you dont even have to come out to anyone cause they already know then you hang out with people through them and so on and so forth and then you have all the friends you want i know its terrifying and seems impossible but future you will thank you for taking that first step
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i really dont want to check out that sub because i know that i would need to bleach out my eyes afterwards
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no it just currently has a bunch of conspiracy theorists and pedophiles that were banned from reddit they arent fighting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,other way around imgur was taking down their posts so they started slimgur and posted pictures of the overweight members of the imgur staff on their sub these were public pictures and names but they were still inciting harassment and got banned for it also noteworthy is that on imgur you could choose whether an image could appear on their front page or not when you posted it they only removed fph posts that got to the front page so if fphers had really wanted to avoid this they could have just ticked the box
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,does it tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not censorship if a private company does it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what happens when reddit doesnt censor anything and let everything run their course the episode with violentacrez fatpeoplehate stormfront actively recruiting via european and td breaking sitewide rules to shove their saggy tired old shit on the rest of us and yet youre here to argue why nothing should be censored please no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why do people always rush to assume when you advocate for one group you advocate for them at the expense of any other its the same with the alllivesmatter shit though of course thats paraded by people completely missing the point of blm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was pointing that because i find hard to believe that working conditions are much better for men than are for women in the industry is the position of a porn actor that much different from an actress that one is going to be an object of predatory behavior while the other one is just a respectable job i just thought that the issue could be framed easily as working conditions in the porn industry but that would just be a minor differentiation i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man this is weird cause youre saying kinda what im saying but were not on the same page word for word he said many serial killers have been involved with porn its such a dumb statement to breakdown involved with could mean anything but in this context it couldnt mean anything other than porn leads to serial killers so he describes the link in what i call a casual way i wondering if this phrase is unique to my part of the country but yes it couldnt mean anything other than porn leads to serial killers thats why its irritating that he comes back at me and other people with i never said porn makes people serial killers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,get them gay marijuana
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just rub my hands together real fast and give it a quick spank anything more and youre just eating a hockey puck sad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,election results hosted by nyt fake news opinion piece by breitbart reputable article yeah your debate skills are phenomenal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all you did was send fake news that isnt even loading on my screen everything that doesnt suit my narratives to the t is fake news i just linked an article explaining why dems win in cities it supports my thesis about welfare babies and entitlements links to breitbart looks like you need to take another debate class says the guy who deleted their posts because hes too lowenergy to admit hes not making any sense outside of his safe space sad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the lusty wererat politician
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ys bby
SubredditDrama,not_removed,manman then there are you happy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,calories in vs calories out exactly im eating right and making sure to stay under a certain amount while also not just having junk food
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i did i regret it one is a shot of this guys niece who is like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the funny thing is it asks if youre before it lets you in gave me a good laugh i highly advise against checking it out though reyebleach may be necessary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh the way she said it and because she was talking about polanski probably not which is kinda fucked i dont know why polanski is supposed to get a free pass but there it is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oops my mistake that drama feels like ancient history at this point however luckily the main point stands that fph were shitheads thank you for correcting me though i feel as though we need to become more concerned about archiving drama i want the drama equivalent of the library of congress
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes remember spez editing posts remember the chat log where they admitted vote suppression
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there comes a time when you break the law or otherwise pose a clear and present danger but the donald does not meet that standard they shitpost alot i will admit but it is nowhere near a censorable factor
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because people think its a sumplus game where one group being specifically discussed automatically means another group is being denied its existence and issues its also become an issue tool to deflect and undermine the topic by redirecting a topic to something unrelated which i honestly dont think op was doing here its no longer the original topic to discuss and debate but becomes a topic to defend and wheel spin if one is constantly having to defend even the point of that point being made then the discussion goes nowhere and the what about debater wins by derailment the best defense here is to go that is a legitimate topic point but we are discussing this point specifically you are more than willing to discuss that point in another post or thread or location that is more relevant to that point most of the time those posters will never ever go have that independent discussion elsewhere because they dont give a fuck about that point theyre merely weaponizing the problems of one group to fuck over and undermine another group again i dont think op was pulling that maneuver but ive dealt with it enough times on reddit to know how to keep on topic as well as undermine the but what about argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i find hard to believe that working conditions are much better for men than are for women in the industry when men get called names nobody gives a shit theyre already used to being called all sorts of insults rocco saying fuck you man to the russian for walking into his video shoot unannounced and proceeding to fuck foxy di was all as trump said locker room talk when women get called names all hell breaks loose because its not only the insults themselves that matter they come frontloaded with gender issues to boot stoya and others took issue with porns pretty boy next door for what amounts to sexual abuse on the job the glass ceiling unlike japan which does have companies whose porn directors are women the staggering majority of directors at americas smut valley are men
SubredditDrama,not_removed,haha yeah its just semantics we have the same point were just using different words to describe it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt you hear injecting marijuanas makes you gay i had a friend who had a friend who had a cousin that injected a marijuana one time and now hes ru paul
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one of ulfrics personal favourites
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on a full moon he turns into a man when the moon fades he also turns into a man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont wanna be on the list so no way im clicking that link
SubredditDrama,not_removed,prolly for the best
SubredditDrama,not_removed,holy crap they wrote essays back and forth about the hypothetical lack of seeing a girls nipples shell lose fans if we dont see her tits nah just creeps no real fans for hundreds of words
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus christ step outside fellas
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill remind you i have no position on the topic i couldnt care less if she submits anything because im not a follower of her subreddit nor her patreon anyway heres my rambling screed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that was painful to read
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your gf example is just so so so so so so flawed since its been shown that girls and guys will the promise of sex as control mechanism to get what they want i get the feeling everyone involved in that thread only has gf examples
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus fucking christ theyre just tits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a woman on the internet i hope i never become internet famous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt she gavin frees girlfriend thats honesty all i know about her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its honestly not hard to imagine that not only will the creeps leave but so will a decent portion of her regular fans because they will see it as a breach of trust and just say she was stringing people along so she could get more money yeah thats totally normal and not creepy no one would ever understand why a woman might later change her mind about posting nude images on the internet but its beyond dumb to think that will just be a happy ending and wouldnt have backlash from the creeps from noncreeps but still boob wanting from her fans and from her diehard fans tfw youre a noncreep but still boob wanting fan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so if i am understanding this correctly alll this over some pics where you can see the faint outline of her nipples weird man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,subreddits like this are always such creepfests i really dont understand the need for a sub dedicated to a single pretty lady when there is so much porn on the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she even issue i never couldve foreseen in my life subreddits dedicated to appreciating for my work filled with people who despise me as a person girls who are popular because theyre hot like streamers and cosplayers almost always have this attitude when their fans are rude and demanding of them which is that its surprising that so many of their fans value their work but disrespect them on another personal level its a doubled edged sword can you realistically expect your fans to treat you like a human being knowing theyve formed a community that acts like youre like a goddess if she ever read their comments she should know theyre not normal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe they should get a new hobby
SubredditDrama,not_removed,with all this salt no wonder everyones thirsty as fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow he went full rjustneckbeardthings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its amazing that these people care so much about seeing this womans tits that theyll write half a page of text dedicated to the subject like do these folks not realize that pornhub exists you can see a womans tits all over the web its not like its some rare thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can you imagine these people actually having these kinds of conversations with each other in person like a couple of them sitting in a coffee shop discussing this topic its so surreal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,meg turney said she was gonna nude up huh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats really scary man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh the drama was entirely different from what i expected
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shes a liar and a hypocrite if she doesnt release them so what if you think shes stringing you along for fame and fortune just leave already if you feel like shes being manipulative stop following her or watching her content threatening a fan revolt to make her do it is also a manipulative tactic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aw fuck i was hoping you were talking about jessica ni wait i mean what a bunch of creeps seriously guys get your shit together
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i always do people are intimidated by anyone with an advanced diction never mind the nudes i just got a boner when i read that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought this sounded familiar then i remembered im on that subreddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is it a good time to plug rcynicism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i knew there were guys really into her but this is taking it to a whole nother level holy shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rcringeanarchy rjustneckbeardthings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im in an awkward position of disliking both the users of these subs and the subjects of them whenever jessica nigri ends up being the face of gaming culture all i can do is shake my head yeah good job guys way to convince the world were not just a bunch of year old boys i gained a lot of respect for pa when they decided to tone down the booth babe culture at pax
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she seems pretty hot id like to see her naked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why are these people trying to give extensive serious overwrought justifications on why they should see one womans tits why do they hide behind a bunch of ridiculous righteous reasons like theyre owed a viewing of these breasts just admit youre a horny fucker who wants to see a pair of tits no one is going to judge you because that kind of thing is expected on the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shits gone down hill since she left roosterteeth haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,her nips would launch a thousand ships if we were in ancient greece
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i want to imagine these people as if they never knew boobs were on the internet like they are the guys who answered honestly when were you born and today they are turning and just cant wait
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good thread she has been stressing that so hard that she will do it and fans will get nips because she isnt a liar its honestly not hard to imagine that not only will the creeps leave but so will a decent portion of her regular fans because they will see it as a breach of trust
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i checked out the photos and theyre all just tits and ass anyway theyre all creeps
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so yes it would make her a hypocrite and a liar if after this she did say actually no im not doing it because she herself out herself on that platform that she isnt a liar and when she says they will be release they will be and its in those comments she has made that has made it clear they would be through patreon since she has straight out said she is trying to figure out the best way to do it without passing everyone off and being fair to her patreon i would like to take this sentence outside preferably out back behind the woodshed where i can put it out of its misery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all things considered it was fairly civil gotta give em that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and admit defeat never
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have boobs and i dont even care enough about them to write that much about boobs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have but that was for a human biology class when i was a sophmore in college
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i occasionally type long paragraphs about politics on reddit what theyre doing might actually be more normal and its certainly more productive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i came all over your popcorn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til screed ty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think he is a fan of her youtube channel and felt it was relevant i dont think he wanted to see her nude as such just like if you love charlize theron as an actress but still feel the need to add to discussions about her modeling career
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you read it i could barely skim those huge essays about whether or not some girl should show her tits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the whole thing reeks of rincels edit spelling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are thousands of them online hell ive seen or in person more if you count the guys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just tits just tits they arent just tits they are tits i havent seen yet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,even if she does release them theyre just going to masturbate for a few minutes then lose interest and go back to overwatch or something this drama is so pointless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if youve never seen httppornhubcommentsonstockphotostumblrcom before enjoy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt work that way meg youre not that kind of girl the irony of his condescending advice is completely lost on him like yeah good looking out sir basement dweller i owe you my career
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there was a girl who was in redlettermedias videos fans got real weird and now she isnt in videos anymore it sucks because she was actually pretty funny i hate how people treat people they like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,saying youre a woman is enough to be famous in some corners of the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id like to announce the new subreddit rlefthandedlunatic dedicated to hounding ulefthandedlunitic till she shows them nips aww yeah finally gonna see some boobies on the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in general i dont want to be internet famous regardless of sex looks terrible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know did you see the patreon earning post according to that shes making like grand a month i think i could put up with a lot of online creepers for that kind of money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she also posts youtube videos and cosplays
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep thats the one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly she should just release tasteful nude photos of gavin would certainly get my attention
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought they broke up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tfw youre a noncreep but still boob wanting fan i dont know if youre being sarcastic or not but seriously would i like to see her tits yes but im not about to sit there and write something like that im not about to pester her about it i feel like this is one of the cases where the poster should have just rubbed one out before they actually posted and maybe taken the time that they need to focus on calming their own tits rather than on seeing her tits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,any day is a good day to see boobs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude half these guys could fall in love with a thumbnail of a girl what i dont understand is if they are so obsessed with a single pair of tits why dont they just go to a strip club theyd see plenty of them all without losing their dignity typing out paragraph after paragraph about seeing one girls boobs on the internet and looking like some thirsty nerd who are these fucking people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ahhh this happened with jessica nigri a while back it was seriously messed up when they got sick of her shit in her sub and moved to another sub dedicated to her to wank over her full on insulted her got into arguments and everything and still wanted to go make a sub about her this site gets really fucking weird
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can you realistically expect your fans to treat you like a human being knowing theyve formed a community that acts like youre like a goddess they dont see her as a goddess it is like shes a real life blowup doll who dresses to please them so they are entitled to a nude titty expansion pack because they are paying customers who support her product i mean they talk about her nips like some easter egg surprise that game developers will eventually release as a fanservice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude i legit do not know how this chick sleeps at night knowing these fuckin loonies are out there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude the people acting like arseholes are the ones who are acting like areholes not her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,her career is based on her sexual symbol status these guys lust over her then she promises nude photos they go wild then theres no nude pics they feel upset lead on as though she only said it to build her fan base it isnt a shocker
SubredditDrama,not_removed,appreciating for my work but when your work is just you showing off your tits what else do you expect but people talking about your tits i dont understand these internet famous women do they seriously not understand why they are popular
SubredditDrama,not_removed,build career around being a sex object complain when treated like sex object welcome to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in reply to that tweet i say welcome to the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup you objectify yourself and then wonder why your fans are treating you like an object
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or speaking to her in person
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i heard nothing about this is there a source on it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do not u summon users from linked threads
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she needs to go back on the know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but only to the virgin islands
SubredditDrama,not_removed,could work out just dont be the guy you wanna be like number or just famous enough to not be some faceless pin cushion but not so famous as to be seen as a challenger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,her nips shall blot out the sun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,explain for a stupid like me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you just come off like hushhush here aka an up himself douche i read all of his comments twice because i had to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,could somebody please translate this please i dont speak neckbeard jokes aside i have no clue what it is that the user is trying to say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someone needs to take that statement out behind the gym
SubredditDrama,not_removed,never go full fanboy kek
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well yeah you already got some
SubredditDrama,not_removed,u gon sho us
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man boobs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am gurl btw
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man i know a few year olds who would murder a guy if it means they could write an essay about honkers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,depending who youre arguing with it most likely is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reminds of the probably apocryphal anecdote about a biology class where the teacher mentions that semen has a lot of sugars in it only for one of the girls in class to ask why it tastes salty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cum isnt salty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,doesnt get used as much as it should especially with all the lengthy shit posted on the internet day in and out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats some advanced diction
SubredditDrama,not_removed,word of the month
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reeks tho they are wreaking the place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reek reek it rhymes withfucking tragic and weird
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mean or pairs right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,especially since like in the case of the girl from juno and that one half of garfunkle and oats everyone gets excited for about a day before moving on to the next woman like the grand unveiling of the titties doesnt actually change anything game of thrones wheel keeps turning etc etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seen one wanna see em all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,blocked by my isp as pornography i shouldnt have been surprised but i was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this blog was literally the only thing that kept me on tumblr before everything else about its shitty did you just assume my coffee flavour culture led me to abandoning it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like the serious wifiu shit in the otaku culture but with real women it makes my skin crawl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hate how people normalise it too like youre a woman on the internet you should expect that like how about no there was that youtuber who was murdered by a creepy fan a few months back and that was because people try so hard to accept fan obsession as something thats totally ok when it should never be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wasnt she mikes so or something i wondered what happened to her she did seem really funny and had a good dynamic with the guys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hate how people treat people they like thats the thing they dont like these women on a personal level or admire them they view them as a means of sexual gratification and objectification they dont really care about them as a person and still see them as the object of their sexual fantasy i might think about how a pornstar is a good whore for sucking a dick when im jacking off but once thats over i dont see her as a whore anymore i see her as a person a person with a life and dreams that is what everyone who acts like the commenters in the thread dont do they fail to move pass the tits and ass and the sad thing is i doubt this behaviour is limited to online personalities and pornstars they probably view the majority of the women in their lives the same way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a woman show us your tits what no youre a dirty whore rinse and repeat the internet has brought great things to humanity but it also causes shit like this people need to grow the fuck up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i already created that subreddit a while ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my tinder profile went viral its been pretty good times for me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cosplaying for women nowadays seems to be making skimpy versions of comic bookvideo game character costumes that show off my boobs then walking around conventions am i wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she left rooster teeth the company and people took that to mean she and gavin broke up but apparently that is not the case and she just went on to do cosplay for moneywho knew thatd make more money than having an actual job
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikimegturney lol i dont know how accurate that is but knowing rt fans theyd probably straighten it out right away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was just a funny and weird way to word a demographic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you say that but if you walk in on your parents fucking you might change your mind
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but strip clubs cost money while complaining on the internet is mostly free
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my gut feeling most of these people would be terrified of going to the strip club i mean its where all the sad pathetic deviants and weirdos go its no place for a well adjusted internet denizen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,teenagers most likely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know you meant a thumbnail image but im having fun imagining one of these guys finding a womans thumbnail and falling in love with it why am i awake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its because these are a special set of tits theyre this girls tits not just any tits but hers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah that was pretty sad too i remember now that you mention it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just what who are these ppl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its funny the mods decided it would be a good idea to make her a mod of the subreddit wtf would they do that in the first place so then she starts announcing that shes doing more exclusive patreon content and anything that gets leaked to the subreddit she will take down immediately so the fans blow up and start their own rebooted jessica nigri subreddit god i love fanboys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what about a side boob dlc is that more acceptable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean they talk about her nips like some easter egg surprise that game developers will eventually release as a fanservice lol im sure its a part of the appeal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean they talk about her nips like some easter egg surprise that game developers will eventually release as a fanservice lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shes a real life blowup doll who dresses to please them i mean this is essentially what female cosplaying is nowadays doesnt entitle them to nude pics though certainly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sure she recognizes that these guys are pathetic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know i read some of the essays
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i kinda feel like a person has the right to change their mind about whether they want to take nude photos for a bunch of strangers but thats just me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its almost like shes trying to make off these people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah and this is so tendentious for some people still
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont understand these internet famous women do they seriously not understand why they are popular my guess is that these women dont have anything to gain by saying they know that theyre popular because theyre hot on the other hand they might just be hopeful or not know the value that most people see in them but when your work is just you showing off your tits what else do you expect but people talking about your tits yeah not sure why this is so odd to some people another user said she might have other talents or skills that she might want them to appreciate but this isnt really relevant to the fans who follow her because shes hot and it shouldnt be a surprise that they want to see more of her body if youre a man like me you probably understand the appeal of these types of women and the feelings of the men who have these types of expectations and like me you probably wouldnt join a subreddit about her and post essays demanding something from her my guess is that a lot of users who disagreed with me and to an extent you are women who arent that familiar with how many guys think and feel about these types of women anyway i just thought id share my opinion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be honest these people were taking this way too seriously why get fixated on this one girl who youve never even met just look up some porn online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair i dont think anyone can fully expect how awful people can get when you start to do more risqué modelling she also does things like youtube videos and stuff which doesnt involve her being half naked so i understand why she would hope shed have a large fan base that values her as a human too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think there should be a balance though you can view someone as an object but still be respectful to them for example i always tell siri thank you when she fulfills a request
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you arent afraid of your sexually and its intimidating to me so i have to insult you to make myself feel better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wouldnt say its that simple but if you base your fame or work around being sexy it shouldnt be that surprising that fans want to see more of you being sexy regardless of the fact that fans shouldnt be insensitive it works both ways women who do want to stream games or make online content because they actually enjoy it and arent intending to be sexy will often have to deal with people who assume theyre just another girl trying to cash in on her looks of course there are women who dress provocatively act sexy on camera and base their appeal on how hot they are and it shouldnt be a surprise to them when theyre only valued for their looks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know right i wish anyone wanted to see my dick half as bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a lot more than i expected
SubredditDrama,not_removed,disgusting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,please god no i can finally watch the know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kinda funny how the first sex scandal in american politics involved alexander hamilton a guy who grew up in the virgin islands
SubredditDrama,not_removed,than i shall fap in the shade wait
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a saying about helen of troy she was the queen of sparta and was kidnappedran away to troy so the spartans waged a war against troy to get her back resulting in the trojan horse incident it is said she was so beautiful her face launched a thousand ships because of this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you say that you have nude pics and then get scared and dont release them to your fans youre a hypocrite
SubredditDrama,not_removed,between all the words typos and nonsense i think theyre just saying she will be a liar if she doesnt do this because she said she would took four or five reads to figure that out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,prepares essay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that story is ancient i heard it at two different schools
SubredditDrama,not_removed,more bitter really
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that happened in my high school sort of the questions were put in anonymously but because of the sniggering from one corner of the room as soon as she started reading the question we were pretty sure it was one of the classclownjock trio all guys the teacher soldiered on admirably anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,surprisingly for something approx of the world has immediate access to its taste remains one of the great mysteries of our time for the majority of the population
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someone whos tasted cum before reporting in yes it is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the assassins creed shouldnt have women protagonists drama was appropriately named assscreed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he used to date the chick from total recall
SubredditDrama,not_removed,never seen a single boob flash maybe its because i spent a few years in new orleans but an odd number of tits didnt phase me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lots of people seem very confused by the fact you could see one of someones tits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean exactly what i said
SubredditDrama,not_removed,never seen someone pop out just one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can finally see kate micuccis tits score now i sound creepy because i assumed he meant riki lindholm who has been topless a couple times
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your isp dafuq
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it depends on who you follow i still use it and its mostly art and bad memes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you should check out the worst cat tumblr
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and yet i somehow stay on reddit despite comments like yours
SubredditDrama,not_removed,waifu
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there was that youtuber who was murdered by a creepy fan a few months back im sorry who
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it does come with the territory being famous grants you attention not just good attention but bad attention it has nothing to do with being female on the internet both men and women get this attention both male and female youtube stars get harassed but its easier to talk about female harassment because it gets dropped into the popular theme of sexism on the internet im not saying i endorse it but most of the time it is just a normal guy trying to get a reaction out of somebody or a group of people and all youve gotta say is titsgtfo and you have a wave of angry people raging about sexism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and if she shows her tits it goes either show us your pussy or you showed your tits youre a dirty whore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well shit i guess were going to rtruelefthandedlunatic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,with the best wang ever i dont doubt it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your first mistake was assuming that comic book character costumes werent already skimpy pretty much every form of popular media has skimpy women in it even fucking pokemon had skimpy outfits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who knew thatd make more money than having an actual job boobs creepy following of internet virgins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the bar is getting really low these days for a wikipedia page
SubredditDrama,not_removed,her twitter has pictures of the two of them together recently so i think theyre still together they have a cute cat too that apparently gave her a nasty bite the other day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is its part of the reason why i wasnt sure if there was any sarcasm or not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your dad really does need to lose weight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,free for them their parents pay the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah its even better they get paid in gbp
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its been nuked but this was the general gist of how it went cause she didnt want her patreon pictures put up there and they all threw a hissy fit directly at her guy made it pretty clear he was still going to sub on the new sub and follow her pics though myserymanwom that is edit oh not all of its nuked that entire thread anywhere she talks was just cancer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the mods decided it would be a good idea to make her a mod of the subreddit wtf would they do that in the first place you mean why would someone want to interact with their fanbase not everyones as toxic as people on the internet if i ran a sub about drake and he asked to be a mod id be more than happy to bolige so then she starts announcing that shes doing more exclusive patreon content and anything that gets leaked to the subreddit she will take down immediately it was always exclusive she just cracked down on her ip being stolen like really i can excuse hating her and turning your back on her bu hating her and going to start a new sub about her what the fuck man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,apparently she did a shoot for playboy according to it showed plenty of under boob yet they were still complaining because they had not seen the nips
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i remember seeing a lets play where her boyfriend said she wanted to get a gun but he vetoed that i think he might want to reconsider that now if they could just teach the dog how to use a gun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so was eliot rodgers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,certainly has the right to change her mind over it but dumb as shit that she ever promised this stuff in the first place and this entire situation could be seen coming for miles away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes not saying she doesnt have a right to but hes rightfully implying that she did this on purpose to get views and
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in many countries verbal contracts are legally binding not expressing a position either way just saying if this was someone contracted to paint your house or install cable and half way through after getting paid on the basis of delivering x they didnt deliver x then it would be grounds for a legal challenge the fact this is boobs rather than a painted fence or extra channels of tv is irrelevant dont commit to something encourage people to pay for something and then dont deliver
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow new word
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh yeah no question the fans are weirdos but thats the kind of crowd you attract with a job like this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ya know i knew she did nude and risqué photo shoots and stuff but ive never seen any of it and i dont care to odd as a healthy heterosexual maybe all i know and like about her is the great work she did at rooster teeth she was wonderful and smart and funny i have no idea what so ever why she left and im not really interested im just sad its come to this however its happned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats true but the nsfw stuff she posts is always at the top so reflects what kind of her work they are after and how they might perceive her i doubt this is the same audience who enjoy her make up tutorials whats the story with these promised nudes i havent heard about them before but promising nudes sounds a bit weird
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair i dont think anyone can fully expect how awful people can get when you start to do more risqué modelling i dont know about this its as if a person never really thought about the value of what she was doing she has to know that men just want to look at her and she will unfortunately attract pretty creepy men im not saying that these followers should be disrespectful or callous towards her i just find that these women who are valued because theyre sexy are very different from others who have some sort of merit based on hard work or talent and people will treat them differently for this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when she fulfills a request misogyny fuming
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whyd you think its her fault
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ew money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we all grow up in the virgin islands edit unless were very unfortunate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it actually comes from they play dr faustus by christopher marlowe the titular character makes a deal with the devil and uses his power to summon the shade of helen supposedly the most beautiful woman of all time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,by the way remember beauty standards were way different back then we hadnt figured out stuff like toothpaste and shaving cream helen would be super gross by our standards
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pepares better essay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also the one where the class takes cheek swabs and looks at them under a microscope and one girl asks why the cells have tails
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id say that the tongue taste is somewhat sweet the swallowaftertaste is whats bitter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it depends on your diet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we are on reddit a place where there are numerous subreddits dedicated to not getting any
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you think there should be people like wine tasters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can only imagine it tastes like popcorn flavored jelly bellies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my girlfriend says it tastes and smell like coconut i disagree
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait how the fuck did i miss that it sounds fucking hilarious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude when was this and can you provide a link
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the chicken from total recall i dont remember that part
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or he got only to base with a girl who only showed him one boobone boob and nothing more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this post is accurate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or the one boobed woman from kung pow enter the fist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you figured out the puzzle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not to be that douche but you might want to know that it is faze not phase i understood the intent of your sentence so no biggie but still
SubredditDrama,not_removed,does it count as a separate tit if they have a third nipple
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well maybe wightjilt meant their cat and janet jacksons super bowl nip slip
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mustnt have been on rall a few weeks ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the netflix original show easy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i meanhttpwwwtruevinenet sorta but most likely he means dns filtering for work
SubredditDrama,not_removed,webcomics apocalypse cosplay thingsmydickdoes some lgbt experience blogs and my friends tumblr is far easier to moderate than reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like reddit in a way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah my tumblr experience mostly consists of memes cats shitposts and nightmarish surrealism ive been able to almost completely divorce myself from the more irritating segments of the userbase
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and porn lots of porn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httttttt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what if your waifu is your wifi modem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikichristinagrimmie ubloomepu police did not offer a motive but said loibl had shown an unrealistic infatuation with the singer and tried to make himself more physically attractive through weight loss and hair and eye surgery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think her name was cristina grimmie or something like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i thought i remember him having his arm around her when they were watching movies and stuff thats why i was wondering
SubredditDrama,not_removed,swear to god if you start giving me a fanbase i will end you p
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also curvier women like meg just seem skimpier in clothing that isnt that revealing because its pretty hard to hide breasts and hips
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i saw that nigri girl for example will take male characters and make them femaleskimpy or make skimpy outfits out of nonhumanoid characters like the pokémon themselves when she does a character like mad moxxi from borderlands okay fine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol i suppose thats true but then on topic i guess she shouldnt act surprised when a situation like this pops up when shes courting the kind of people in question
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiikeaman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh im not actually part of the demographic if thats what you mean i dont care to see her boobies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is a sub with subs to a woman who does cosplay it is indeed a wonderous world we live in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah he was messed up how does he relate here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i really dont think they have the right to be upset
SubredditDrama,not_removed,weve done it reddit weve reached full entitlement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah for you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think anonymity and internet porn combine to create this particular brand of weirdness why cant they be chill about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i think shes a funny and cool person too i liked the videos she was in for rt and always saw her modelling as just one of her hobbies not her career yeah she has a nice body and its good that shes comfortable in her own skin but thats not why im a fan of hers and if she decided to stop modelling i really would not care whatever makes her happy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats the story with these promised nudes i havent heard about them before but promising nudes sounds a bit weird i dont know the exact story but it sounds like people are twisting her words because she has shown some interest in doing nude shoots for when she is ready and has said that she isnt a person who tends to lie which probably happened at separate two occurrences rather than one combined statement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like you are saying that the followers should be disrespectful and callous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just find that these women who are valued because theyre sexy are very different from others who have some sort of merit based on hard work or talent and people will treat them differently for this there are plenty of fans who enjoy her for more than just her modelling which is why i would imagine why shes upset just because she has posted in lingerie and has a nice body doesnt mean she has no other interests or skills
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tbf i tried the male voice once and it just wasnt working out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,steve buscemis face launched a thousand firetrucks on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,with his penis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but who was the damn fool that shotim
SubredditDrama,not_removed,took me a minute
SubredditDrama,not_removed,prepares counter essay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to me it just tastes like snot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ladies ladies please we can all settle this like adults just put your keys in this bowl have i mentioned that eyes wide shut is a great movie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah its pretty obvious why its not known by so many i just think its hilarious whenever i see this topic and probably the easiest way to find out is to taste your own
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thatll just make the whole spitorswallow issue even more socially complicated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsgamerantcomubisoftexcusesfornofemalesinassassinscreedunity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was about years ago between when unity was released and when liberation was released and sadly i have no link i dont know if there was single codified thread but it was popping up all over the interweb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think hes thinking of rashomon
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that was literally the best part of the movie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mean you dont totally recall it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the original
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe he meant exactly what he wrote ive heard seeing an odd number of boobs risks casting you into the ethereal plane
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you know chandler irl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see no reason why not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mandatory joke about the only pussy ive seen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre correct what did i miss
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wireless internet was a mistake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rlefthandedlunatic subscribers ohhhh someones got a secret admirer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,woohooo internet fight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actually the pokemon character i was talking about was skyla gym leader in bw and shes in a two piece outfit that bares her midriff and thighs which is not something i personally expected out of pokemon not to say its bad or anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup i agree but these gals always have to pretend that they arent just employed because of their looks its not like this is a viable career path if you arent attractive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now the bar cant go any lower
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh no i just wasnt sure if i was responding to one of those cranks that thinks that seeing someone in a sexual way automatically means that youve reduced them to a sex object like its impossible to see somebody sexually and also as a person you dont seem to be saying that its nothing personal ive just run into that type of thing more often than i liked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and theres a sub of people who hate her but dont want to stop looking at her pictures
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this chick makes thousands of dollars a month being pretty on the internet capitalism truly is a machine that takes money from the dumb and gives it to the smart
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are that support him having a say in it assuming they live together if owning a gun makes households statistically less safe then i think its reasonable for half of the household to have a say in it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they live together and hes also not american so i think his feelings on guns are a little different
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair im giving an abridged version of an already abridged story i imagine there was more of an actual discussion rather than dictation im pretty sure they live together too in that case id say the other person can have a say in it if only because its their house or apartment too and i say this as somebody who doesnt have an aversion to firearms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just because he was a pathetic loser doesnt mean he wasnt dangerous just a few months ago christina grimmie was murdered by one of those pathetic guys as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in every other business transaction you pay money for a service and you get that service why is this any different sure she can choose to not put up her pics just like her fans can choose not to donate to get patreon i dont see how its entitlement at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i learn new things every day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my goodness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why you gotta be a dick
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the chill died the day the internet was created
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as an occasional photographer i have found that one models definition of nude might not be the same as anothers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe you misread i very clearly said that they shouldnt be theres obviously a difference between what people should do and what they actually do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not going to say much more after this comment because im not trying to offend anyone and i dont think i was very clear with my message as someone responded else and mocked me anyway my message was intended to be descriptive and my point was not that she is without talent charm or another appealing feature
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im unreasonably angry at you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,metaphorically

SubredditDrama,not_removed,prepares dictations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not how i remember that movie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean maybe it is the next step in geneticallyengineered poultry production but im not getting the excitement over a threebreasted chicken pst he edited the typo after i replied
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kate micucci got er tatties out for netflix and noshed off wosserface from watchmen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,best girl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well she was on the pre rec stream for a while after she stopped being in videos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stop slutshaming gym leaders bruh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,correction she makes httpsgraphtreoncomcreatorjessicanigri from her patreon plus whatever she makes for all of her appearances and other contracted gigs what a living
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am not even being judgmental here but the thought of people throwing money at people who get nude on the internet boggles the mind i mean you literally have millions of hours of free porn of anykind satisfying any fetish available to you at the click of a button
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but individuals like eliot rodgers have very unique and extreme issues i dont think its fair to demonize a community of creeps who we know very little about by comparing to a man who was clearly very evil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how about objectifying people and thinking someone owes you their nudity is entitlement and normally not in every other business transaction thinking that getting your rocks off is just as important if not more important than a persons individual professional decisions simply because they give you some form of media isnt entitlement i would be very interested in your definition of entitlement if that doesnt fit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my reply was to an insult that has since been edited and removed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you got baited my reply was to a ruder comment that is now edited and gone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these guys are probably expecting to be able to see every detail while the picture might end up technically nude while everythings covered up with strategic posing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you said that you arent saying that they shouldnt be disrespectful got bit by the double negative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay thats fair the way it was worded made it seem like you were arguing the opposite but we can leave the convo as is mistakes happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,believe me the anger you feel is entirely reasonable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,got milk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aaron burr sir
SubredditDrama,not_removed,studies the blade
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not getting the excitement over a threebreasted chicken speak for yourself friend thats an extra breast for everyone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh shit good for her ruins my joke though haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont bandwidth shame all bandwidth ranges are beautiful
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jeez dude im just showing you the other side of the argument ownership is just a more complicated issue when you live with someone because you share basically everything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while he couldnt stop her straight up people in a healthy relationship will discuss things with each other and listen to each others opinions especially of its a decision that impacts both of them its not being controlling its being adults
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i imagine having a gun in the house is something everybody be in the house should feel comfortable with im pretty sure when he said no it wasnt in a im denying your right no but more of a i really really dont want this so i might move outbreak up kind of no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you have to think about the situations that cultivate this kind of behaviour its not like they got up one morning and decided to shoot up some girl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,her business model is literally the objectification of herself for money of course people are going to objectify her i dont really think its entitlement when you pay for a product and expect to get that product again she is free to not post those pics just as those people are free to not pay money then again knowing the kinds of people that donate to her they probably will still follow her anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah gotcha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i just didnt proofread very well thanks i changed it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while you studied the blade i wrote a countercounter essay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre just salty because you like dialupkun the worst character his voice is fucking unbearable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre not very clear but ill try to respond im not going to attribute that a community like rmegturney is a sort of force that compels men to kill women most individuals like eliot rodgers have many extreme problems with themselves and their familes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ha but i reveal my trapessay and summon three counterpoints in one turn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,again a lot of people know those statistics and object to gun ownership on those grounds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not my partner has a say over what i buy its my partner has an opinion on what i buy and i respect that opinion and take it into consideration before making a choice youre making it sound like he forcibly stopped her from buying a gun when in reality they probably had a discussion about it and he changed her mind at least thats how relationships are supposed to work you talk about big choices and make them together and buying a gun is not a small choice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres a gaping hole in the first line of his story and the only person pointing it out is sitting at points assuming the anirondack mountains are actually the adirondack mountains there arent any wolves in the adirondacks or maybe he hit on the only pack back in that even rangers havent witnessed yet there are coyotes ive heard those out there but that doesnt make nearly as good of a story though does it edit rereading his story more carefully he never saw a wolf only heard them guarantee this guy heard a couple coyotes howling back and forth and thought teh wolves r comin curious where he parked to get a hour hike though did he climb marcy from blue mountain lake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope he keeps defending himself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he broke the rule of you can tell totally bullshit thing in a story and people will buy it for example he could claim he survived a snowstorm by making an igloo or he could claim he fended off wild animals with camp fires but claiming both at once disaster
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what gets me is how specific he was about timber wolves and when hes told theyre not in ny its just oh well it was some wild animals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,knowledge weighs nothing his might weigh slightly less
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at day break i start my hour hike back to my car the first day i had a buddy of mine bring me into the woods on his quad and he hauled ass day i disassemble my camp and head back i left at am i get to my car at i mean he could have driven some of the way met up with a buddy and have them quad him in it is poor story telling though because i am wondering where the hell the car came from i am also wondering why he continued to hike for another and a half hours after getting to his car
SubredditDrama,not_removed,any guy who focuses on tinder while alone in a snowstorm is good in my book
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someones been reading a lot of jack london
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all you brought was a homemade knife a bushcrafter without an axe maybe his homemade knife was a multi tool yet no issues with keeping a fire burning day and night sorry actually multiple fires burning day and night hmmmmmm see above all you brought was a homemade knife not even a fishing line yet no issues catching and eating nothing but fish for days straight im surprised you had time to catch so many fish without a line while also collecting enough wood without an axe or saw to burn multiple fires all day and night look the homemade knife was bad ass ok whys that so hard to believe i once widdled a very fine knife from wood that could chop wood and start fires and im not even outdoorsy also any true bushman knows you can fish with your shoestring or if in duress make an intricate net made of your sturdy body hair that catch multiple fish for days experts believe pubes are best for such a net
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this guy seems to think the proper use of a semicolon is when i dont know if im supposed to use a comma or a colon
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this guy really wants some hollywood exec browsing reddit to swoop in and offer him texas for exclusive rights to his totally not fake story
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like a great experience but i was under the impression that wolves stay away from humans typically but i was only one person and they can be unpredictable its easy to fight off imaginary wolves too i imagine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so op is the main character from the the long dark
SubredditDrama,not_removed,p i p e d r e a m
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that username tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,obvious troll is obvious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats up clowns
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ha reminds me of when i was new to camping i pitched a tent by a lake in maine and fell asleep only to be woken by eerie howls that had me freaking out in my bag for the rest of the night it sounded like a whole pack of coyotes was out there and everything is creepier at night so my poor brain was sure they were coming for me fast forward to the next morning when im on the lake in a canoe which i promptly fill with shit as i hear the exact same howls coming from a little ways away right on the water it was the damn loons i had been huddled in my tent terrified of harmless waterfowl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the hour hike back is what sealed it for me even if you assume an offtrail ultrapedestrian rate of mph thats still a mile walk which will get you across most wilderness areas outside of the bob or death valley with ease fifteen hours is also about the average time most ultrarunners take to cross the grand canyon and back maybe he was roughing it in frozen head though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude has a bunch of rireland posts as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there have been wolf sightings in massachusetts so its not totally out of the realm of possibility but yeah probably coyotes edit just read this was back in yeah dude that probably wasnt wolves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,with his home made knife
SubredditDrama,not_removed,even just the igloo part is enough to set off the bullshit detector you can only really create an igloo from deeply compacted snow so if youre starting out with just a leanto then no snowstorm will give you enough to make a full igloo from
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no timber wolves probably tundra wolves then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,swipe right no matter what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he never even attempts to explain how he caught the fish so frustrating i just wanna read more of his bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the silliest thing about the whole thread was ops insistence that he only brought with him a homemade knife in the north woods a hatchet is more important by far you need to cut branches to build a shelter so you dont freeze to death you need to cut firewood so you also dont freeze to death amongst the many other benefits of having a fire and you can even butcher and skin game with a hatchet what the hell is a homemade knife anyway was he trying to talk about flint knapping i dont think he knows what that is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know its not the point but its bothering me whittle you whittled a knife
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he says that his homemade knife was a solid piece of metal that was like a machete with saw teeth on one side
SubredditDrama,not_removed,semicolons are implicit in javascript
SubredditDrama,not_removed,texas using php perl powershell
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont always pipe but when i do its to the most interesting grep in the world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh shit its you tell us more about your incredible adventures
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what wildernesswild forest area were you in to get a hour hike back to your parking area legitimately curious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this might be weird to hear but i loved the sound of coyotes howling the sound gives me frisson every time if i could hear them in my bed it typically meant that the weather was very clear with a bright moon it definitely evokes a one with nature feeling in me i loved to sit back on the porch and imagine what they were trying to communicate to each other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,harmless birds will steal your bread plus they have corkscrew penises
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe he dropped acid in someones backyard and saw a weird sheep
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and perimeter of campfires
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why would you bring anything but a homemade knife out into the woods totally defeats the spirit of bushcraft otherwise
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he built a garbage compactor and used that to make snow bricks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,down the thread he says the igloo was really a sort of teepee with snow packed on the outside
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah if he had said he made a snow cave or snow trench or something it would have been a lot more believable but an whole freaking igloo out of fresh snowfall in upstate new york riiiight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or direwolves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rbladesmith making knivesblacksmithing is a popular hobby
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would assume he meant one that he forged himself it really isnt that difficult even though his story is entirely bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,according to op the knife has saw teeth on one side so i could buy op being able to use it to cut wood
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a wittle little whittled knife
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you dont need to end a statement with sadface in javascript your misery is implicit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol its an old snl joke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have been on many adventures what do you want to hear bushcrafting world travel sexual exploits i think there is one experience that is all three let me know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was near lake george i dropped my car off there stocked with some food and water and had my buddy drive me to the opposite side of the trail the plan was he got me to one side and i made my way to the other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey that dude on the porch isnt paying attention well never have a better chance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey hey hey hey daryl daryl hey daryl i found a dead thing carl carl carl hey carl wanna fuck this has been coyote masterpiece theater
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only the ducks and thats only because female ducks dont want to get raped
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and copious amounts of tactical urine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because people hear about how true survivors get their shit lost in an unparraell events also i know of white fang that a character tried to do this towards wolves it did not work well for him because fires eventually die out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what is this minecraft
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no shit there i was just me my homemade knife and a jaguar daishi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and there are some knives that also have axelike properties ive seen a few thickbladed khopesh that would work really well for most axerelated smalltimber needs also since i never get to use this word and doubt ill get a chance to use it again axeshaped items can be described as dolabriform hooray stupid vocabulary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,threeve dollars
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like toonces era
SubredditDrama,not_removed,were going to need another post just for this post how are you not seeing that your admittedly well researched lie is not sliding by nearly anyones bullshit detector its so painfully obvious that this is a desperate attempt for attention and praise
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sexual exploits please dr cool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,note to self dont reincarnate as a duck neither male nor female
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jarate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am convinced that he has tacticool everything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont forget your anti searhino underpants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry if i wasnt clear i was copying what op said in the thread i linked as a joke im not a big gear person either that defeats what bushcrafting is all about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well now i know that word for the rest of my life ill just tuck that in next to avuncular and quiescent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think i accidentally angered a few key people in that sub i also realise people want to hear more about techniques so i will focus on that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill have to get back to you on this i have to go food shopping i did post another bushcrafting experience called arctic fire
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ladies have corkscrews going the other way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he has crafter about fires in a freaking snowstorm too arrive build a fire make a lean to build a fire hear wolf build multiple fires craft a teepee build a fire
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah so full blown delusion it is then ill pass i hear about that enough these days
SubredditDrama,not_removed,please explain how you caught fish using only a homemade knife thats what im most interested in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we are waiting with baited breadth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,with cut guys the head scrapes me more and i get sore really fast is she fucking barnacled old sailers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what is it foreskin friday lets make this a thing srd in fact lets take this shit to srdd i dont care if guys get circumcised lets go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i honestly think people just get dumber when they talk about circumcision
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think someone need to create rbadickanatomy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this nigga clever af using memes to defend mlady nd shit so alpha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,more foreskin drama what the hell is up with today and foreskin drama you make it sound like i meant scraping as in like a damn butterknife scraping as in skin to skin friction did i fucking say i get cut this comment wins the internet for me today incidentally butter knives are not sharp at all dont know what the hell shes talking about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not cut this woman makes me feel good inside
SubredditDrama,not_removed,collection of books in their language i think thats more of a german stereotype than other eu people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao she because she didnt see i edited a little while after i posted and thought i edited to avoid a message popping up in her inbox
SubredditDrama,not_removed,second lady seconding your points i have absolutely no preferences for penises anything thats in the general neighborhood of average size is clean and doesnt appear to be grossly deformed is gonna work just fine im much more about who its attached to than about the penis itself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,doesnt smell like ass is really the only quality i look for in a penis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i spent enough money on upgrades that there damn well better be a difference
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most vaginas arent sensitive past a certain point why make childbirth even more painful than necessary i can tell the difference inside of me between cut and uncut but i cant really chalk it up to a particular sensation neither is better or worse it just feels a little different
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you need to actually have sex in order to feel dicks inside you tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only thing i can think of is that maybe she doesnt get very wet during sex and since an uncut guys foreskin will produce a bit of lubrication itself that makes sex with her less dry just use some spit or lube though jesus also my vagina wants to shrivel up and die at the imagery of barnaclecrusted sailor dicks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol she did clarify later that she meant friction which i understand from experience but damn her original remark was a hilariously bad choice of words
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hah you pathetic losers dont grow dick barnacles
SubredditDrama,not_removed,use lube for christsake that will work better than the crushed walnutbased product she excretes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably because its something generally decided for you early in life and you dont really have any control over it its like race or height it becomes difficult to distance yourself from the topic so it becomes personal and emotional for people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably because they lost the brightest part of their dingus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and its always the uncircumcised that bring it up the most
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that because whether they prefer cut penises or uncut penises is their opinion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it would be an eternal engine of strife between the cut and the uncut sides i myself am on the starbellied foreskin side further marginalizing myself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is having a very organized fridge a german stereotype or just that it looks like all healthy food
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre also the one who hated on her because she doesnt like cut penises
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i decided to get ahead of the curve with the whole foreskin thing i got mine enhanced looks something like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ass smelling dick its gross on so many levels
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well stop sticking them in there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you a sex robot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no wonder davy joness crew was so bitter and angry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i specially said sailer which is a boat and was not actually a typo for sailor who would be foolish enough to make that mistake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i told her that its possibly because she doesnt get that wet but she claims to get soooo lubricated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have dick anemones smooth gentle keep predators away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe try barnacled old sailors and see if that helps flipthescript
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpyoungmenshealthsiteorgguidespearlypenilepapules
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mean the woman in this thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not sure which side you mean uncut but more importantly im imagining a tiny tattooed star right under the head of a penis we can go with temporary tattooed if we dont want to think about needles but its the happiest little image in my head and i wanted to share
SubredditDrama,not_removed,have you ever seen american sex ed shit most american males see an uncircumcised penis for the first time in like gym showers and really you never see it in action unless you watch porn with uncircumcised actors which is also demonized and even then that doesnt give you a great idea of how the thing works it is porn after all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,first of off im female not an uncircumcised guy you clearly didnt even read the entire conversation if you didnt gather that much so im not sure why youre even giving your opinion secondly im basing this all off of my experiences with uncut and cut cock the first comment in this thread agrees with me women cannot feel nuances like that when it comes to cock are you saying that the foreskin doesnt get pulled back when a guy is hard what part of what i said is wrong please inform me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus christ it doesnt go all the way down to the ballpark does it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt hate i told her nothing she said made any sense and explained exactly why nothing wrong with preferring uncut cock but its absolutely bonkers to say that cut cock scrapes her and she denied it being a lubrication issue on her end because apparently she gets sooo wet so everything she said made zero sense also her rage paragraph had nothing to do with the original conversation at hand she raged about an edit and me saying something about adderall edit gotta love white knights lmao
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this was a risky click but its sfw
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yo dude howd you fit an entire lady down your pants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the foreskin docks with the pelvis forming an airtight seal around the vagaina if seal is unable to be maintained inspect rim of foreskin for chips cracks or other forms of damage remove and replace foreskin if suspected damage on rim of foreskin is observed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lets just say that two days is the max a junk should go unwashed beyond that lies madness and cock waft a week is where you reach chemical weapons
SubredditDrama,not_removed,alas no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know you are joking but youd be surprised how often it would work
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can they do the wave
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why would i lie about being a woman lmao im basing my comments off of facts ive seen being with both uncircumcised and circumcised men what point is there to lie rnothingeverhappens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,american sex ed varies widely from school to school so i dont know how you can make an overarching statement like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes they can you just cant dont speak as if youre an expert on all women do you usually have sex with a condom on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gotta love people who respect womens preference and life experiences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,speaking of adderall you should probably invest in some chill pills
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my cock gets washed every morning during my shower part of my morning wake the fuck up routine if in the unlikely event that someone else has interest in interacting withy cock the first thing i do is calculate my level of physical activity for the day the number of times ive pissed or wanked and the length of time from said morning shower this will directly influence my desire to clean up before fun times happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh god never have sex with someone who was just wearing sports pads
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we are all horny on this blessed day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i was younger and single i used to think guys had it so rough and girls could just get laid any time they wanted because there were horny guys like me out there willing to fuck anything and i didnt understand why a girl might ever have trouble ever getting laid even someone unattractive or overweight but now that im older and maybe because im married i dont think i would ever just accept any invitation to have sex with a random stranger who walked up and said lets fuck i think the most important reason for me feeling like this is any person that would do that is probably a nasty ass person and nobody should want any nasty ass
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if i had no standards i could do the same but i do so okay not any rando someone with low enough selfesteem or just plain kinky enough to have sex with literally the first person that shows up and asks and im not sure i want that okay maybe the latter but even then its usually not worth it its just sex after all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,heh i think i was just playing to the crowd feel free to downvote if you want apologies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ur sexy wanna fuk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had gotten the reference but didnt know if you meant something specific by it like uncut or literally meant the star mostly i am just amused at the mental image i had
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its generally pretty shit on the whole though they definitely dont talk about cut and uncut dicks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this isnt a me thing so dont make it out to seem like its something thats exclusive to me scroll up in this thread and youll see a few women saying they cant feel differences in cock like that on top of that ive had this very conversation with my other female friends and the ones ive talked to agreed with my experience too and no i dont use condoms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am pretty sure i have already said i have nothing against her preference literally the comment before this one and why would i have something against her life experience what does this have to do with respect i just made sure she understood that nothing she said made any sense look at how she approached the issue go reread her narrative she is an attention whore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hurrdurr good one i didnt realize people still referenced chill pills best thing is that she couldnt stop replying because of her adderall no acknowledgement that she has free will
SubredditDrama,not_removed,speak for yourself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also not sleeping with a murderapist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would say no too but out of my close friends i know several who would without a doubt say yes and some who would think it over and say yes too i think its because guys are never hit on when was the last time a girl with the intention to have sex with you complimented you asked you out or invited to buy you drinksdinner etc we are simply not used to it i would say my group of friends is evenly divided in girls and guys and i can tell in a normal night out that the hottest guys have to work hard to hook up with one chick while the ugliest girls in our group are swatting away guys all night of course those guys are usually not ones you would hook up with but they still get hit on a normal looking guy is to my knowledge never hit on you might get a compliment after you take the first step to get to know the girl but thats about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah many guys would say no i still think the percentage of guys who would say yes however small would surprise her saying yes is not that high and i would be hard pressed to find a room where girls would say yes to a guy asking outright you wanna have sex with me right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ok lets say it work on guys which in my opinion is a low estimate do you think if guys wen up with that phrase to a girl a single one would get laid i am not saying it always works just saying the math works out better for women in the case of being extremely direct
SubredditDrama,not_removed,depends what color are your fish it will also go a long if you can help me find out who is playing in the very beginning of this set
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as long as the life lesson you take away is that penises without stars on their bellies are bad then im putting this in the win column
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah i see therefore your sample of under women is clearly truth yeah sounds legit thats totally how that works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you were criticizing her because of her experiences with cut penises and them not being comfortable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah you sound super defensive the whole time like youre either a dude going full asawoman or a very confused woman its not that youre wrong its that youre just not right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean youre using slurs against mental disorders and white knighting unironically so im not sure you have much of a leg to stand on tbh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh yeah id also think it was actually some setup by her nogood boyfriend to rob me or jump me or something this was actually always in the back of my mind anytime i was meeting a girl for the first time lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i saw a video on tumblr of a girl walking down the street getting catcalled by many men and she would respond in kind they immediately made excuses and removed themselves from her presence i doubt that many men would really respond favorably to that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you honestly think women dont get rejected am i some magical snowflake because i get rejected all the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh yeah i know people who would definitely say yes too and yeah i get what youre saying about getting hit on as a guy i think a lot of that is that is not understanding a woman for the most part isnt going to just come up and say whatever we imagine in our heads if someones into you theyre going to let you know in more subtle ways like looking at you repeatedly or smiling at you things like that it sucks for us but its just our culture that kinda makes us be the ones to make the first move but not always
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the main factor making the difference in that quota in my opinion is the setting you ask in there are a lot of alternative lifestylessubcultures swingers bdsm some polygroups etc on which being more upfront or even quite direct with such thingsconversationsquestions is more acceptable than in the mainstream of course the reason for those being alternative lifestyles is that most mainstream people dont feel comfortable with that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,red fish blue fish are the options i can offer i am useless otherwise
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i will forever be disappointed at the lack of starbellied dicks that im sure remain in my future maybe i need to buy some temporary star tattoos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol this isnt a scientific study like i said im basing this off of my own experiences never seen a woman say they felt a difference also that isnt even what my original argument was about in the rstarterpacks thread so im not sure why youre changing the topic as if that was what i was focusing on the best part is that you think i cant feel a difference because i potentially use condoms what a stupid implication like i said many women agree that they cant feel a difference between cut and uncut cock not sure why you had to assume its because of condoms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you read my replies at all her experience doesnt make any sense and when i offered an explanation and she said tehe thats not it i get so wet she used loose terminology and couldnt even get her story straight she is just a medical mystery i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have absolutely nothing to be defensive about but thanks for your insight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what the actual fuck are you talking about what slur how could i use slurs when i have been treated for mental health issues for ten years now lmao you seem like someone overly sensitive about someone calling out others for bullshit and yeah whenever a woman mentions sex desperate white knights flock to her defense how is this not white knighting look at her bogus comments that got upvoted and people like you standing up for her when she is nothing but a female using her gender for attention
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at being catcalled maybe not but if some girl normal looking not a not really ugly and asked a guy outright hey wanna have sex the number of guys who would say yes would be insanely high compared to the number of girls who would say yes even to a comparatively much hotter guy asking
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess i was not clear enough of course girls get rejected but if you ran the test of having a guy go to a hundred women and only say do you wanna have sex with me and a girl did the same she would have way more guys saying yes than the guy would have girls but you are a magical snowflake have a happy new year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to me the biggest problem is girls know exactly what they want but many times are scared to say it so they are always nice to some people because they are polite and now how to treat people and be nice and others because they genuinely like them the problem is from the outside both feel pretty similar so while she is getting frustrated about the guy not making a move he is thinking she is just nice to everyone and he doesnt want to make an ass of himself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the setting doesnt matter two everyday examples clubs and coffee shops i can assure you if a normal looking guy went in and outright said hey wanna bang right now he would be rejected by every girl on both scenarios if a girl did the same she would find more than she expected men completly willing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know where you are from or how many male friends you have but honestly that estimate is insanely low at least around people my age in europe and the parts of america i know about and if you agree all girls would say know it still means the number of guys who would say yes is way way higher
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this was literally done on one of those social experiment type videos on youtube the guy doing it got i think the girl while obviously still getting rejected got more than i think the channel is called whatever if i remember right i have no reason to think its fake because there really isnt any extra entertainmentclicks to be gained from faking it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like they said in high school if you aint got the star you aint gettin far but everybody who said that ended up living in a trailer park so ymmv
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because condoms reduce sensation if you used condoms you wouldnt be able to tell im beginning to suspect that you arent what you claim either youre not a woman or youre a virgin because this level of sexual ignorance is astounding edit nope youre a chick alright damn well im sorry seems you need a little more sex ed i thought everyone knew condoms reduce sensation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i read your replies and you disregard the fact that people can feel differently than you she said that cut penises bother her and you care too much about something you cant control you act like youre going to have sex with her and you need to convince her that cut penises feel fine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,naw dude theres no guarantee someone who has been through psychiatricpsychological treatment cant be dismissive or rude towards others with mental issues and hey for someone so upset about people not reading your comments i just want to point out its somewhat hypocritical considering ive never defended her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you really just dont care to know anything about this person youre prepared to get naked with and present your genitals to seems like asking for trouble
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i totally get you but you miss every shot you dont take right so the guy in the situation you gave if he isnt making his move because he doesnt want to make an ass of himself then hes always going to be in limbo its embarrasing for sure to get rejected but nobody cares in reality we build that up inside of ourselves and were harder on ourselves than anyone else is going to be if we get rejected
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes setting was probably not quite the right word i meant it in connection with the part about alternative lifestyles coffee shop vs swingerclub will probably yield different results for what anecdotal evidence is worth that fritzl guy was known to frequently be at the largest austrian swingerclub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao that wasnt my point my point is why would i fucking make a giant generalization if i used condoms do you seriously think someone is that stupid to say that they dont feel a difference in cut or uncut cock while using condoms you are pretty dumb if you think someone would do that its fucking obvious condoms reduce sensation which is why nobody would ever make a claim like that if they used condoms religiously its funny you think other people are ignorant while being the truly ignorant one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you clearly didnt read my replies if you havent gathered im a female why would you assume that im trying to convince her that cut penises are fine if i dont even have a penis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you need to learn what so upset means i dont think people should be making judgements about the conversation when they didnt even read it in its entirety thats all im not even sure what that has to do with me saying youre defending her but whatever floats your boat happy new year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would say no sorry if that was not clear i do however have several friends who i am certain they would say yes to be honest the scenario is so impossible for most guys that who knows how they would answer it simply doesnt happen that a girl comes up and is honest about what she is looking for so guys are used to going up and getting rejected over and over which makes some guys jaded and susceptible to say yes to the first girl who is remotely on target
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i know i actually dont give a crap if i am rejected but i do know of people who have been in the type of relationship i mentioned above where both want and neither makes it clear in my case i am only scared of making an ass of myself if i have to see the girl regularly like i would never try to hookup with a work partner just because if i read the situation wrong and she says no i have to see her everyday and that would be incredibly embarrassing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actually out of my group of friends one of the guys who would say yes is tall handsome and currently applying to be a firefighter so in great shape he simply has a really high sex drive and has never been too picky regarding women as long as they call him hot and have a resemblance of a personality people come in all shapes and sizes and sure some horribly unappealing guys would say yes to anything that moves others like to have more than physical attraction to hookup with someone other just want looks sex and never see that person again none of those are bad as long as everyone is honest all is consensual and no one gets hurt physically or emotionally
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the consensus around here seems to say you are in fact the ignorant one but ill just let you keep making a fool of yourself in peace
SubredditDrama,not_removed,none of your comments said anything about you being a girl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and yeah whenever a woman mentions sex desperate white knights flock to her defense how is this not white knighting look at her bogus comments that got upvoted and people like you standing up for her when she is nothing but a female using her gender for attention so yeah take a step away from reddit and enjoy the rest of the night or sth lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats kind of what i mean its easy to say youd say yes when you know youll never be put in that situation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well many people know what they would do if they won the lotto i know i would say no some things you kinda know even if they dont happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i really dont think men have any experience being a position like this or any idea what it would be like because if they did they wouldnt say things like that women are so lucky that everyone is always asking them for sex have any of you ever wondered why women say no we could be having all this free sex
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i personally have been in that position luckily for me it was not in club and again luckily for me sexual assault was never something that scared me because i had pounds on the girl but saying no sucks specially when they keep insisting and they continue to pester you in social media and shit also most of my friends are girls so i have pretended to be the boyfriend of them night after night for years so i have some idea of what girls have to deal with i was not trying to imply women are lucky for some reason i am getting all defensive i was just trying to say that women think people joke about how men would say yes but its not completely a joke not every guy would say yes but the percentage would be surprising
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sorry for making assumptions i just have trouble believing that if the situation flipped over night and women were in a position to demand sex from men regularly that those men who think they would say yes would really say yes maybe some of them but it seems like you are assuming things about your friends that they may not know about themselves anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont worry we all make them i tried to make it a one case scenario because i know if it became an everyday kind of deal men would start saying no really quickly but with the current society if a women did that i think some men would say yes for sure i could be wrong about my friends but i doubt it they have really high sex drives and have never been picky about women thats a combination that ends up in saying yes to pretty much anything a girl says haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah maybe to be honest it is just a little hard for me to imagine youre a good guy for pretending to be someones boyfriend in that situation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this webpage has changed me now when i hear good guy i think of the rniceguys and thought you were insulting me there i get what you mean about the situation being hard to imagine i might be completely wrong but my experiences and the people i hang out with make me believe that would be the case
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good guy definitely doesnt mean nice guy but i can see how you would think someone on reddit would insult you for doing that its good to take breaks from reddit every once in a while if only to restore your faith in humanity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man if thats what theyd call fat and ugly im not sure i want to see who meets their standards
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont see how a stomach like that can be seen as fat by anyone who isnt a devout anorexic

SubredditDrama,not_removed,conspiracy knows what it is politics likes to pretend like its news
SubredditDrama,not_removed,more like firing a missile into it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,every couple hours thats being generous

SubredditDrama,not_removed,who is more credible a us general or you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rpolitics or rconspiracy feeds you the line
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not a paid shill
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shill
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i called it first help help mods im being repressed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,check your privilege
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i dont really see what holding a twothousandyearold corpse in prison would accomplish exactly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,considering he was dumb enough to run silk road inside the us in san francisco of all places i dont think his criminal career is anything to be concerned about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well sure if you wanna be soft on crime go ahead ya bleeding heart
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what are the odds of you being a repeat offender if your cell mate is a year old corpse though that shit stays with you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,would the corpse get the top bunk since hes been their longer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just the typical libertarian twisted logic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,doesnt beat this oldie but goodie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the funny thing is the closest thing to a civil rights organization that dealt drugs as a fuck you to the government was the original black panther party and whether or not it was lies spread by j edgars meddling its what caused support for them to dwindle after even among the black community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well in order to be in the civil rights movement you had to open a darknet marketplace and place at least one order to have someone killed everyone knows that s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what happened with his trial i remember reading about him getting arrested but i thought he just kinda caved and pled guilty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you cant just put whatever names you want in a list and say they are analogous plato aristotle and kimbo slice are all rolling in their graves right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til putting out a hit is a victimless crime edit i havent followed this case since like two years ago so if something new has happened could someone let me know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oy vey
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your mind your heart and your balls gotta be in one accord — plato aristotle kimbo slice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,putting out multiple hits but since one of them involved rogue dea agents and other hitmen might have been swindlers scamming ross out of money this shouldnt count against his character even if he casually wrote about paying for murders and receiving reports of murders carried out in his personal log if youve already heard about corrupt cops then youre pretty much up to date if not you should google carl mark force iv and shaun bridges that was one thrilling story i mean just look at those names appeal is somewhere in the works now and is heavily based around said corruption since the case against those agents began before dprs trial potentially tainted evidence was likely excluded from the trial and most painful bits were obtained independently of them anyways so the appeal is basically his lawyer doing what a lawyer should and throwing everything at the wall though chances something will stick seem pretty low
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh just skimmed a quick article about the appeal that entire investigation looks like it was a shitshow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gotta stay tough on crime amirite i dont know facilitating the indiscriminate trafficking of large amounts of drugs and other wholesome things like forged documents and paying to have people killed sounds like the kind of crime we should be tough on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im somewhat surprised by the sdny judges rulings she is pretty well respected from what i recallhuh well well see what the circuit says
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you should read up on this case i have and i think entertaining conspiracy theories about the whole thing is irrational the states case against him was so overwhelming that the jury reached a decision in a couple hours meanwhile evidence of any conspiracy basically amounts to it feels weird man and seeing as the two fbi agents on the case plead guilty to committing a lot of this stuff that he was being charged with no two agents who werent even fbi involved in a part of the investigation were charged with money laundering and wire fraud what ulbricht was eventually convicted of basically came from a whole different team in a different law enforcement agency altogether wired did an you should check it out not to put away a criminal mastermind oh he was no criminal mastermind thats for sure his story is of someone so completely out of their depth its almost comical what he did was really serious though i think life is a little harsh but he definitely deserves to be in prison imo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but at the most it shouldve been like years because i dont think he was involved at all with the murder for hire stuff murder for hire aside essentially running a criminal empire no matter how poorly or how out of your depth you are is in fact grounds for landing someone in jail for life if he was a small time or even a mid level dealer hes get years or whatever but he since he was at the center of a wide reaching network either rico or the kingpin statute would apply here and neither are forgiving
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think he was involved at all with the murder for hire stuff that trial is coming soon i think and itll be interesting to see because thats when all the dirty agent stuff really becomes relevant the chat logs they found on his computer are really really damning though it looks like the hits were really just a scam on ulbricht but he still ordered them even on people with kids and stuff really chilling its an interesting psychological case too from eagle scout to drug kingpin i watched the deep web it was good especially the parts that werent just about the silk road i am totally outoftheloop on that dark internet stuff so it was really interesting and ya that wired article is a great read on the whole case
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cant lie watching you feverishly reply to all of these posts calling you out for being a degenerate fuckwit is kinda impeding with me getting any work done one of us one of us
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you must be fun at parties is that when you people shake to noises while talking loudly about stupid bullshit and getting intoxicated i dont do those well that answers it i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont agree with their aggression but i think they have a good point the reason for guidelines for sentencing is so that the law can be applied fairly and evenly not only to provide legal certainty to citizens but to try and avoid bias in court now the obvious bias here is whether an adult has a cute kid or not but i have to wonder what if the guy was black black people and latinx people tend to get harsher punishments for the same crimes compared to white people possibly also east asian people but im not sure on that one its not imposible to imagine that happening in this situation a little unconscious bias here or there heck people get harsher penalties if theyre sentenced just before lunch compared to immediately after or early morning we dont want to introduce further potential for bias im not heartless or anything there are often mitigating circumstances for fines driving bans not having money needing the car for your job you were speeding while rushing to the hospital or parked illegally because youd heard a family member had been injured there but having a cute kid isnt one boy you must be fun at parties but thats why the judicial system isnt invited to parties you cant have friends as a judicial you have to follow the legal code as closely as possible thats the whole point edit just realised how long this is im not just humourless im a law student and going against best legal practice scrapes on my nerves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,school is very important its the entire difference between worthful and worthless remember that topkek must member that only peeple who goes to skule are worthy of respek
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now theres a redditor i havent seen in a while glad to see hes being his usual self
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im just going to go ahead and say daww and feel nice that this is in my city that is all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wheres the comment about jazz
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someones really salty that they had to pay a parking ticket sounds like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some people are really against just enjoying something that should give you the warm fuzzies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,such a blatant troll
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what an angry little man wonder what happened to him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait so you have to appear in court for a parking ticket in the us that seems excessive and like a drain on ressources
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my god what a justwhat a fucking inept retard i genuinely think this person might have autism his inability to measure a situation and tailor a response is telling and the fact that he continually responds to the abuse he is getting with tons of riamverysmart material is hilarious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you sound poor weird how you literally talk poor how does one talk poor i weesh i hud bewks as a keed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you should have your testicles removed to protect humanity youre more animal than human holy shit some people are full of hate and rage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one of us that doesnt quite know how to use the word impede or possibly with but impede seems more likely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that just reminds me of this one csi episode where someone with downs syndrome was murdered and at the very very end grissom tells the killer retard means to hinder to hold back and then he does that slight head tilt and then goes it looks like your life just got retarded
SubredditDrama,not_removed,heavy is the head not buoyied by the gentle winds of biological existence tis not enough to be a slightly more complicated animal nay the upright man strives to sharpen his vision to pierce the gauzy veil of fun to behold true purpose that sharpness of vision is indeed honed on the whetstone which is reddit also big party at my place march im baking a big weed cake and theres gonna be a lotta loosegenitaled people milling around and also lots of rock n rollfunk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why do you keep referring to this as sentencing its not and its therefore much less serious with much more room for discretion without as many restrictions on what the judge can or should do etc youre a law student you should know better see joel feinbergs penaltypunishment distinction in the expressive function of punishment pollock and maitlands distinction between true afflictive punishments and fines in history of english law ed ii lasswell and donnellys distinction between condemnation sanctions and other deprivations the continuing debate over responsibility isolating the condemnation sanction the traditional common law distinction between infamous and noninfamous punishments etc the upshot of this is that penalties like parking fines really just dont matter that much in terms of justice and punishment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think theres room for leeway in situations like this the effect that this will have on the child and other people in the courtroom is i would argue a far greater positive than
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a law student and going against best legal practice scrapes on my nerves i have a buddy who is a lawyer i call him he calls the assistant da and boom my parking tickets just get dropped thats bias and happens everyday probably all over the world i doubt the judicial system will collapse because a judge forgave a most fine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,amazing how much speculation you packed in there for a law student
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from my understanding the law was never intended to be applied to the letter which is why we have judges in the first place for cut and dry cases like this economic circumstance is a huge factor in severity of punishment when it comes to fines like a man working in a pizza shop struggling to feed his year old kid who he cant even afford to hire a babysitter for while he goes to work is going to be hit a lot harder by a fine than your average middle class white collar worker in that case even just the threat of such a fine would seem to be enough to scare him straight if you think parking in the wrong spot for too long is such a grave offense the judge shouldnt be waiving the fine as a law student i would think youd be more aware of the nuance involved in its application do you really believe the judge solely based his decision on the presence of the mans son lmfao
SubredditDrama,not_removed,u got anymore of their drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,loosegenitaled people im not certain if this is a positive description or not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now that we have conclusive proof that judges will act favorable for cute children i have a business idea not everyone has children and the people that do often have ugly children i should start a business where i rent cute children to people who are defending parking tickets as special character witnesses
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly because im being a bit lazy but also my degree doesnt focus on this aspect of law its in the philosophy of law jurisprudence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would disagree with you the original thread says the judge does this often which mitigates it slightly for me as long as theres exorbitant that he does so in a non discriminatory way at the same time justice is already a game of luck and this only makes it more so please dont think im against leniency im not at all i think america is far too harsh in its sentencing but legal certainty is vital for faith in government and its enforcement this is only a small example of it but it all adds up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats really shit though im not saying that the legal system will collapse but surely you see how this kind of behaviour reproduces inequalities and unfairness it undermines the principle of justice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i doubt the judicial system will collapse because a judge forgave a most fine uh actually it kind of does in my state not paying any kind of ticket is a big deal if you get enough of them and are delinquent for long enough they tack on fines once those fines sit there long enough or go over a certain amount they suspend your license so then you have some poor slob who cant afford to pay tickets driving on an expired license they get caught once or twice and then theyre arrested literally hundreds of people in my state are in jail because of delinquent fines that make it inevitable that poor people are going to get nailed with a felony usually in combination with other misdemeanors because enough of them makes judges and jurors less lenient and more likely to give you jail time now who knows lawyers richer people who doesnt the very same guy whos probably the kind of dude who cant go to traffic school without getting fired cant pay the fine and cant not drive even if its illegal in a system that already puts poor people at a huge disadvantage any additional corruption or favor for richer people only exacerbates the problem for instance consider what happens if too many parking tickets go unpaid because theyre dropped the city loses revenue so they have to raise the ticket amount or impose harsher penalties the burden of the increase again falls on the people who already got the short end of the stick with the previous regime and does nothing to deter people who still have the means to make tickets disappear and thats just what happens with something as simple and cheap as parking tickets we all saw what happens when you have a big ass company like bp doing shit like dumping oil and killing workers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol parket ticket corruption
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol right the upvotes hes getting are depressing i think its more a case of this sub generally enjoying someone finding a rational way to agree with the bad guy in drama or make sense of their vitriolic rants in reality though the dude in the thread was a pretty blatant troll lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im copying my reply to someone else that seems relevant here like i said and sort of noted in my reply to darkwing i think there are absolutely circumstances that can and should be considered economic situation is definitely one of them but thats part of why i think irrelevant details such as a cute kid shouldnt be considered whether one can actually afford to pay seems a lot more important to me as it is i think we have similar concerns but different approaches as to their resolution mine is to follow the law as evenly as possible with allowances made for circumstances that would make a penalty more onerous or unfair lack of money requiring car for work mitigating circumstances around the offence except for those categories i support a very even approach that way injustice inherent to the law is more likely to be noticed and addressed your approach seems to be to give more discretion to judges since theyre on the spot and have access to details in that particular case if i had confidence in the impartiality of judges then id probably agree with you as it is i am wary that this approach would actually entrench preexisting inequalities through unconscious bias which would also make it harder to legislative problems the people most able to bring it to the attention of lawmakers or campaign groups would probably be those most likely to benefit from uneven application
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sure just click on his inciteful comments or just randomly stroll through his comment history any time in the last couple of weeks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im picturing an adam sandler movie where he makes a living schmoozing judges and getting called as a character witness if the judge like kids he brings kids if the judge likes golf he plays golf but then big evil businessman hires him and the judge is the woman in every adam sandler movie so he has to learn that love is whatever it will have a on rotten tomatoes and will quintuple its budget which will be eleven dollars
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if we had our own stable of kids we would only have to pay basic maintenance on them no overhead i call dibs on being the guy that goes out to find cute kids the child hunter if you will
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we would have to agree to disagree as although i respect what you think about the law i just believe that the law should not always be put to the letter and that would instill a large dislike of the justice system for both the child and parent as although it may be nothing to the state it could potentially be a lot for the family and that by being lenient the judge is being more human more understanding especially if this is his first offence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it undermines the principle of justice in what i would consider an inconsequential way think of this way most people that speed are never caught and never ticketed for the infraction so if a small percentage of those that are ticketed do not have to pay their fine either its an immaterial number in the grand scheme of things
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah that guy was either a troll or just a colossal cunt probably a good mix of the two
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im having an awful day and that made me laugh thank you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you know who likes pizza everyone we should make our base of operations a pizza shop gonna need a huge underground area to store all our pizza toppings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like i said and sort of noted in my reply to darkwing i think there are absolutely circumstances that can and should be considered economic situation is definitely one of them but thats part of why i think irrelevant details such as a cute kid shouldnt be considered whether one can actually afford to pay seems a lot more important to me as it is i think we have similar concerns but different approaches as to their resolution mine is to follow the law as evenly as possible with allowances made for circumstances that would make a penalty more onerous or unfair lack of money requiring car for work mitigating circumstances around the offence except for those categories i support a very even approach that way injustice inherent to the law is more likely to be noticed and addressed your approach seems to be to give more discretion to judges since theyre on the spot and have access to details in that particular case if i had confidence in the impartiality of judges then id probably agree with you as it is i am wary that this approach would actually entrench preexisting inequalities through unconscious bias which would also make it harder to legislative problems the people most able to bring it to the attention of lawmakers or campaign groups would probably be those most likely to benefit from uneven application again im putting way too much thought into this sorry i just want to say that i think we agree on a lot but differ on implementation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but this is an employed member of the legal system deliberately prioritising their friend might not mean much to you but if you think about which people are less likely to know lawyers who know people you get those who live in typically uneducated communities those who are economically disadvantaged and those from a background typically underrepresented in the judiciary legal profession such as people of colour to low income people could be the difference between food and no food i know that you not being ticketed wont mean one of them will get ticketed still the fact that access to middle class high earning groups will increase your chances of evading a fine compared to someone who is more likely to be unable to pay it well thats just very distasteful
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he is also a traditional genderneutral pronoun in most english speaking circles where do you study law
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope your day gets better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,send me an email about it although make sure you use the codewords
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i completely agree with you we need to rely on strong institutions rather than hoping for strong people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats just very distasteful sure and that may say more about society as a whole than well undermining the judicial system
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not in england where im based im not being rude just informing you of my pronouns
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope your adam sandler movie gets made
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah want to make sure our boners are hidden of course part of our code should be oldtimey slang because were goofy like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes it is lol where in england are you based and if you want to inform someone of your pronouns why not just explicitly state so instead of a curt corrective ambiguous phrase it comes off far less standoffish if youre actually trying not to sound rude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you tape yours up or down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because it was just a minor correction imagined parentheses and im based in oxford
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but besides that what a stupid bitch everyone saying it was the guys fault for dropping the thing you retards he didnt make her run out in front of the high speed running men this bitch needs to get hit by a car next time hopefully she never has any kids but we all know with her intelligence level that is highly unlikely what the hell is this guys problem thats some high level edge right there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the title sounds like a lemony snicket line
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people taking that way too seriously from bobble to impact was what two seconds barely enough time to make a rational decision and start acting on it it was a mistake that probably hurt but later on everyone involved will laugh about it and remember that one time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the entire thread is a dumpster fire shes probably a volunteer without much training who just thought oh shit the tape is sailing on me better catch it oh shit why did i go on the running track when the runners are right around the cocrash its called panic not stupid that said i cant see why they had to set up that close to the end of the race unless they were running late which makes her mistake even more forgivable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes saying it in advanced riamverysmartese but hes correct in terms of things like osha risk assessment and insurance every big fuckup is the result of a chain of smaller fuckups
SubredditDrama,not_removed,am i the only one who finds that style of writing really aggravating and smug it really kept me from even getting into series of unfortunate events
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while that sentiment is true hes using that to back up his original claim of laying all the fault entirely on the guy in charge so hes really just using unrelated experience to be a jackass and sound smarter than he is to make up for his complete lack of ability to read a room
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its very tongue in cheek
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you should give the netflix series a watch even if you dont like the books i loved it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh still put a bad taste in my mouth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im planning on it actually
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the netflix series is a total improvement over the book series characters are more fleshed out and plotlines are actually finished
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also it has neil patrick harris
SubredditDrama,not_removed,true is always a good stop for drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if thats true its pretty interesting no its really not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in what sad myopic mind is this subreddit drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well it actually kind of is the games are decades apart and it would be a fun little connection
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am interested to know why there is such a visceral hatred towards pedophilia the kid fucking thing its definitely the kid fucking thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this barbaric and primitive bronze age morality is whats holding society back all this time said the man as he advocated for fucking children and animals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can it vote no then you cant fuck it simple right plot twist nobody in malaysia can vote
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its always interesting to me that pedos just want to have a conversation as tho their points havent been made and refuted time and again i think they mostly like the attention on reddit i should say and get off on talking about having consenting relationships with minors honestly i think the best course of action is to just not engage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love how such a big part of the argument he posits lies on tying opposition to child molestation to notions of conservatism or antiquity its true that your conservative christian mother probably told you satanists are out to kidnap you she probably also said video games cause you to become murderous and that masturbation makes you blind thats all bullshit but that doesnt mean she was wrong when she warned you against the dangers of adults who touch you in the wrong places and it doesnt mean she was wrong even if that advice was given out of irrational fear and not out of being well educated on the deletrious effects of child molestation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,forgetting the pedophilia for a moment what exactly would be the counter argument to him saying that sticking his dick into an animal is just as bad as us eating the animal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,happystarlightnothin wrong with a good fantasy the only problem is trying to make it a reality and trying to fuck something that cannot give consent also comparing being gay to having a fetish made me laugh one is something that gets you off the other is more of a relationship thing than a fetish thing not saying that the two cant overlap it was just a shitty comparison
SubredditDrama,not_removed,op i just want you to know i watched law order svu to feel better after reading this drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these types confuse love with what how being aroused makes them feel somehow someway they spiraled down so far into what turns their crank that the only thing left that scratches the itch is some naked time with timmy saying you wish they would just kill these degenerates usually incurs the rath of reddit so ill just concede the we must study them nonsense and quietly pray for raining asteroids
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that article is gross why did i read it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why does everybody write in english on that sub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,old thread got removed for biased title so im reposting it with a proper one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao obvious troll
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like thing weve been seeing a lot of lately why is everyone one attacking me just because im a nazi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this isnt a fair characterization later on he says if their bodies arent ready for anal or vaginal sex oral should be fine right or just simply touching so you see its really a very reasonable position
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this barbaric and primitive bronze age morality is whats holding society back all this time said the man as he advocated for fucking children and animals i would like this to be on my tomb stone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,porn is illegal in malaysia and i was searching if i could go to jail or get fined if i was streaming it because i had read some articles of it happening turns out everybody still watch it and dont care about the restrictions i stumbled upon this dark thread while searching and im not gonna lie it was pretty disturbing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,explains ancient greece though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think they are just really frustrated with themselves and want desperately that other people tell them they are not bad people in the end some of what he said is kinda true he is mentally ill he didnt choose to be attracted to them the thing that fucks me up is that he tries to justifies why it would be okay to do it even though it is so obvious that children cannot give consent especially when you can assume that he read the article on the thread just before commenting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its always interesting to me that pedos just want to have a conversation as tho their points havent been made and refuted time and again its the same with everyone pushing a point of view they know in their heart is wrong i just want to have a conversation about whether the holocaust was realwhether the earth is flatwhether climate is changingwhether hillary is running a pedophile pizza shop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean you could make the argument that animals killed for food would never have lived in the first place without the meat industry maybe giving something a brief life is better than no life at all beastiality though affects quality of life and is entirely negative breeding and killing animals for food affects quantity of life and could be argued to be positive is it better to live and die young or to never live at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,animal cruelty killing animals for the sake of consuming it nowadays is usually frown upon if it wasnt done fast and painlessly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,be a vegan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is but you have to get passed layers upon layers of cultural indoctrination and desensitization eating norms start earlier than religious norms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,although it doesnt really address that question as much as it does the question about whether or not its always harmful some jurisdictions do see a distinction a man having sex with a mcchicken is cruelty a woman helping her uncle jack off a horse isnt if youre of the opinion that bestiality is always animal cruelty its an extremely flimsy justification to defend the consumption of meat in the vast majority of cases in western society where meat is an unnecessary more expensive luxury that isnt even neeeded for a healthy diet on a sidenote the majority of zoophiles are as against pedophilic sex as anyone else i dont like that the guy in that thread is lumping us in with him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,copy paste from the old thread why i think he could have grouped pedophilia and homosexuality together ive only been living in malaysia for one year but from what i understood homosexuality is still much more taboo in here than in western countries
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not sure how knowledgeable you are of malaysia but english is very well integrated as a second language in the country where people speak as much english as they speak their mother tongues everything is most of the time written in english and in bahasa malayu and often in mandarin too theres a lot of different races in malaysia malays chinese and tamil are the majority and they all speak different languages bahasa malayu mandarin tamil and multitude of chinese for example hokkien and hakka and indian dialects it would get pretty hard to understand each other if they all spoke in their mother tongues so they all speak in the one they all understand which is english which was introduced when malaysia was still a british colony
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont suggest doxxing users
SubredditDrama,not_removed,every time i think i cant lose more faith in humanity some asshole on reddit juts has to prove me wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not a violent or angry man but molesting and hurting children makes me feel very violent and angry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at least hes willing to compromise and take a nice moderate position on the issue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe someone will make a flair
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like older drama it adds value to the sub its nice to know people cant piss in it without being obvious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not all heroes wear capes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,remember to set your dns to something other than the default to get around the isp block
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well played
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats my take on it you cant choose or get rid of your fetishes but you can absolutely choose whether or not you act on them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think they are just really frustrated with themselves and want desperately that other people tell them they are not bad people they arent bad people right up until the point where they try to justify it as moral then they become bad people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,have you seen pictures and videos of factory farms its much better to have never been born than to live a life of pain and confusion on a factory farm in cramped dark and unsanitary conditions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i get that animal cruelty is the issue but in my mind theyre both equally cruel and that death of the animal is probably worse yet i still eat meat so putting aside my revulsion towards his fetish i wouldnt know how to argue against him for saying that fucking an animal isnt any worse than killing and eating it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just so you know its not done painlessly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no u
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like that the guy in that thread is lumping us in with him us
SubredditDrama,not_removed,makes sense i suppose
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you want to lose some faith in humanity read the news article in that post jfc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,agreedthen i go to rwholesomememes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reddit is one of the more sanitised mainstream public forums as well it gets much much much much worse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,animals too and for the love of god if someone combines the two kittens deserve better jokes aside fuck anyone who does any of this stuff
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is why i always let a thread ripen before i submit it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,google dns is like and
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pedophilia is not a fetish and should not be called such its a mental illness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you gotta draw the line you could not have picked a better place well said
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont get me wrong im against factory farming its awful for the animals and awful for the planet and awful for people i was just using that argument to say that beastiality and animal agriculture arent direct comparisons from a morality standpoint personally though i agree with you completely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a different argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was saying it was negative for the animal reviewing sex against its will the dogs may not be traumatized in this scenario but the animal its having sex with probably is at the very least even if its not traumatizing its not enjoyable for the animal thats enough for me to say its negative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i tried to argue with someone who brought up that point never again after awhile he brought up a counter example that floored me if fucking an animal is wrong but kill it for food is okay what if i fuck my dinner can i make a burger and fuck that this conversation can get too weird too fast for my taste also it depends on the quality of the burger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,personally i dont think theyre both equally cruel i know i might start some drama here but i dont think its inherently cruel to kill an animal rather its cruel to have them suffer when theyre alive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably because its actually a very good point im actually surprised nobody has come up with a single decent argument against itimo the fetish is nasty but then we live in a world where we kill animals to eat kill them for fun experiment on them without heir consent and so many other messed up things with that in mind the whole morality of being anti beatility thing just feels hallow and hypocritical though i guess a half decent argument is that the same people against beatilisty are also against killling and eating pets like dogs and cats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the difference is killing an animal for food serves a function its necessary for survival and its done without the animal suffering
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so you know its wrong to eat animals and yet you still do it and support animal cruelty why not clear your conscience and stop altogether and if your answer is because its too hard when has doing the right thing ever been easy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the worst is that it doesnt seems the government had any solutions for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im good thanks ive depressed myself enough for one day just reading that comment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope youre vegan if you are against animals being molested forced insemination is standard practice in the animal produce industry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wouldnt that one probably be blocked as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,indeed humans are biologically made too basically not be attracted too those who are young arent we
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is being gay a mental illness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what if i fuck my dinner can i make a burger and fuck that you know if i didnt absolutely adore my current one id flair that in an instant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thankfully sounds like a discussion that would only come up online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can i make a burger and fuck that wasnt this a viral video about months ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why wouldnt this apply to humans though just interested in your opinion not trying to argue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not nessesary for survival in first world countries
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so you know its wrong to eat animals and yet you still do it and support animal cruelty i didnt say its wrong to eat meat i said its cruel why not clear your conscience and stop altogether my conscience is fine with my meat eating ways thankfully and if your answer is because its too hard i eat meat because i like being jacked meat is my primary source of protein and fats both of which are essential to muscle gains when has doing the right thing ever been easy i havent decided what the right thing is yet as of now i need protein and fats to sustain my physique thats enough reason for me if one day i have the means to eat meat that was ethically hunted or whatever i would make the switch fortunately labproduced meat exists now and when it becomes common place this wont be an issue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think he never thought hed actually see one i had a similar existential crisis the first time i met an actual nazi on this site
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah it was depressing in multiple dimensions the apparent ease of finding it the inabilityunwillingness of the government to do anything the fact that people are into that kind of thing to begin with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rwholesomememes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when you put it that way i guess im alright with animal molestation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sadly a lot of animals have been bred so that they can only be artificially inseminated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i grew up on a farm there was no artificial insemination there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why would they have to be vegan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i honestly think thats an interesting point but you come off like an asshole
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah srd never fails to take the real drama back home
SubredditDrama,not_removed,incoming popcorn alert
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no idea how it works to be honest just trying to helpful lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but what if it wasnt against its will the problem is that we dont know if the animal consented or not currently we have no way to tell so its better to assume that they didnt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see this is my problem i dont have a head for the flair game or i would have used that one like years ago lol i like yours too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on twitter and i think it was a mcchicken
SubredditDrama,not_removed,simply and hopefully it doesnt come across the wrong way but i think humans are inherently worth more based on that theyre the only species to have what wikipedia calls conceptual consciousness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know either way because they animal cant tell me so ill ere on the side of caution
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive got news for you not everybody in first world countries can afford to go full vegan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not only is it cruel but it is unnecessarily cruel in this day and age there is no good reason to use animal products i dont know how something can be cruel but still not be wrong i would have to perform a lot of mental gymnastics to reconcile that there are very many vegan bodybuilders some of whom even go so far as to say bodybuilding is easier and more efficient on a plant based heres an example of one from a very cursory google search httpswwwforksoverknivescomveganbodybuilderplantbaseddiet if you do a bit of research you will be able to make a dietary plan for yourself that is free of cruelty with all this in mind your argument still boils down to quitting meat will be hard so i wont do it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i remember the first time i ran face first into reddits pedo defense force trademark pending its one thing to see some pedo in a random thread getting downvoted thats just internet to see a fucking swarm of kiddie fuckers all brigade a thread and seriously upvote comments comparing hating pedophiles to hating jews and black people that just makes you wonder if youre in bizzaro world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously this is the sort of shit that creates vigilantes with public support
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unless it involves morally outraging the muslims like the implied gay scene in beauty and the beast child marriages are still prevalent in some of the rural areas in malaysia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really you dont find it even a little disgusting and yet im the one being an asshole
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because they seem to have a very gungho attitude against animal abuse and especially animal sexual abuse and last time i checked forcibly inserting metal rods into a vagina is sexual abuse no matter what the reason so they should be doing everything they can to prevent abuse to keep their beliefs consistent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,does me coming off like an asshole invalidate my point there are literally billions of animals being abused sexually and otherwise in the animal produce industry forgive me for having a hard time being sensitive toward peoples cognitive dissonance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean they want you to have it your way sometimes that involves some extra secret sauce
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel a similar way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sentient animals would make this whole argument maddening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,being vegan is very cheap there are some people who actually cant go vegan but most people can
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not only is it cruel but it is unnecessarily cruel in this day and age there is no good reason to use animal products i dont know how something can be cruel but still not be wrong i would have to perform a lot of mental gymnastics to reconcile that unnecessary protein is necessary for building muscle there are very many vegan bodybuilders no there are not you literally pulled out of your ass first of all many is a term thats relative to the rest of its group the overwhelming majority of bodybuilders are not vegan so saying there are many vegan bodybuilders is disingenuous at best some of whom even go so far as to say bodybuilding is easier and more efficient on a plant based heres an example of one from a very cursory google search httpswwwforksoverknivescomveganbodybuilderplantbaseddiet if you do a bit of research you will be able to make a dietary plan for yourself that is free of cruelty with all this in mind your argument still boils down to quitting meat will be hard so i wont do it maybe if you did some actual research instead of pulling facts from your ass to support your argument youd have a leg to stand on since ive already proven your claim of many vegan bodybuilders to be a lie the rest of your argument falls apart it turns into some of the few bodybuilders that are vegan say its easier on plant based the vast majority of bodybuilders follow the opposite train of thought by the way your vegan bodybuilders require much more protein supplementation in order to gain muscle mass something youd know if you werent lazy af and just eager to push your agenda without any real knowledge of the subject you were attempting to speak on i understand that youre simply standing up for what you feel is moral but when you attempt to argue about nutrition without knowing what youre talking about you make yourself look like a moron and simply hurt your cause edit by the way i just looked at your link and gee what a surprise it was pure garbage hes all natural but doesnt compete in a competition that has any form of drug testing and he explicitly states that he does not track his macros even though its pretty essential in determining how much you should be eating leading up to a competition yeah thats bullshit too but also a convenient way for him to avoid detailing his alleged pure vegan diet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good thing i never said it was needed it is the most efficient food for it though guess that makes you the tard
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they already exist httpswwwfacebookcomdarkjusticeuk are an extremely wellsupported one in the uk has the backing of some police forces and has led to arrests im sure if you asked not much short of of joe public would agree with them existing over here and to be clear i do agree with them although am surprised its not classed as entrapment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i do but i find meat more delicious than i find it disgusting i didnt call you an asshole
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre turning child abuse and fucking animals into an argument for veganism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre definitely being an arsehole artificial insemination is also used to prevent extinction not just for us herbivores
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is something different than what you said i think youre mistaking me for someone else but lets assume that youre correct and we can tell when animals can consent bob goes to his horse and asks to have sex his horse does whatever it does to affirm the consent while theyre having sex bill comes over and spots them and thinks that bob is raping his horse now what bob says its consensual but we only have his word for it we only have bills word as well now were stuck because we cant ask the horse whether or not they consented its not enough to assess their emotional state
SubredditDrama,not_removed,considering the fact that obesity is the most prevalent in the poorest parts of most if not all first and second world countries i find that hard to believe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre being pretty rude and irrational so i dont wish to continue this conversation further best of luck to you and your gains
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not talking about just support vigilantes im talking murderously pissed off citizens packing weapons thats inevitably what thing devolve into once law enforcement andor the judiciary in a region come to be seen by the general public as ineffectivecomplicit in regards to heinous crimes for long enough theres a lot of that going down in parts of mexico where the cartels are strong if people cant get justice through official channels at some point they will lash out in an attempt to make their own
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look if you eat a burger you might as well operate your own childanimal sex ring its practically the same thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the unhealthy diets correlated with poverty are just that correlated everyone with a keyboard and a reddit account can tell you the solution to making poor people eat healthy in one paragraph but the reality is its way more complicated than most people will admit the healthy food may well be cheap enough but there are other factors than just price
SubredditDrama,not_removed,poorest areas are less likely to be educated in nutrition most grains fruits and vegetables are cheaper than meat and dairy also thats a bad excuse not to go vegan not everyone can do it so i shouldnt if you want to eat animals just say you dont care enough about them to stop eating them stopmwith bullshit excuses vegans will respect you more for saying you dont care rather than coming up with bad arguments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre being pretty rude and irrational so i dont wish to continue this conversation further best of luck to you and your gains you lied to me in order to push your agenda theres no reason for me to be polite to someone who is willingly spewing bs and no youre arent choosing to discontinue this conversation due to rudeness since you were the one being rude in the first place by lying to me youre choosing to run away because you have no real argument and werent expecting to be called on your bs best of luck on your crusade
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whey is actually just protein so no by definition it cannot be more efficient since my diet is largely fats proteins​ and then the obvious minerals that are found in meats and not in whey thankfully i dont need to spend too much time on you since your seconds of googling didnt reveal to you that whey protein comes from milk an animal product its a byproduct of the production of cheese youre as bad as the vegan commenter who grabbed the first thing off google without realizing it hurt her argument i mean you couldve made a less shitty argument using hemp protein but i guess that wouldve involved you actually having to learn about this subject and why learn about something when you can just pretend to know what youre talking about right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not sure how you came to that conclusion i think ive been pretty polite
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those poor violated animals getting thermometers stuck up their butts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought it was but maybe thats just me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most grains fruits and vegetables are cheaper than meat and dairy also thats a bad excuse not to go vegan that is not even remotely true vegetables fruits and grains are very perishable which causes them to have a very short shelf life this jacks up the prices even if that were true your argument makes no sense if healthy food were cheaper poor people would be buying it also thats a bad excuse not to go vegan not everyone can do it so i shouldnt thats not even close to my argument if you want to eat animals just say you dont care enough about them to stop eating them stopmwith bullshit excuses what a bullshit argument just because i rely on animals for nourishment that does not mean i dont care about them do you think animals cruelty laws exist purely because of vegans vegans will respect you more for saying you dont care rather than coming up with bad arguments nobody cares about the respect of selfimportant vegans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kendrick farras is vegan i think he is doing pretty well with his diet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not once did i lie to you you didnt prove shit you are just being ignorant and rude i could argue with you all day and it wont change your mind because you are an ignorant meathead
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fruits can be frozen and rice and beans are some o pc the cheapest foods you can buy its not expensive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh well that explains why all fruit is kept in the frozen section of the store wait no it isnt because thats bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah you cant find fruit in the frozen section
SubredditDrama,not_removed,frozen fruit about per bag gives you about servings for i can get servings of unhealthy burgers i rest my case
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rice and beans are cheap too most people in first world countries can afford to eat vegan just say you dont care about the animals and would rather just eat meat stop with these bullshit excuses
SubredditDrama,not_removed,subsidies often go towards subsidising meat production which has other nutritional and environmental implications and it has been found that out of the subsidies to subsidise crops from – around two thirds of this went to animal feed tobacco and cotton production on the other hand farmers producing fruits and vegetables received no direct subsidies the environmental impact of meat production is high due to the resource and energy requirements that go into production of feed for livestock throughout their lifespan for example a kilogram of beef uses about times as much water as an equivalent amount of potato the subsidies contribute to meat consumption by allowing for an artificially low cost of meat products httpsenwikipediaorgwikiagriculturalsubsidyenvironmentalimplications
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just say you dont care about the animals and would rather just eat meat stop with these bullshit excuses keep making that bullshit argument all you want youre just making yourself look stupid this isnt china people care about animals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no shit people cant live on rice and beans alone i never claimed that if you can afford to eat vegan or have a rare disease i dont see any reason not too also china cares as much as we do they just eat dogs while we eat pigs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,guess again httpsenwikipediaorgwikicrueltytoanimalsunitedstates httpsenwikipediaorgwikicrueltytoanimalschina
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol cruelty is cruelty we care slightly more but we treat animals we eat horribly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just imagine your a kid riding your bike and some random year old dude comes up to you forcing you to stop demanding to know where your bike came from cause he thinks you might have stolen it just a tad bit fucked up if you ask me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sorry but if your father is basically forcing people off their bikes its assault just because they have the same type are you kidding me thats not cool thats not even an efficient way to get your bike back
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the kicker of the guys story is this yes we know who did it nothing ever came of it though my guess is they werent kids
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ops reasoning those kids were so they were old enough to face the real world so what his dad did was okay but for some reason he and his sister werent in the same boat despite likely being in the same age group when something bad happens to them its okay for daddy to step in when something bad happens to a bunch of their peers its not okay for the police step in report the bikes stolen dont go angry vigilante jesus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,edit to people saying this is assault get a fucking grip haha if i actually did any harm to you that would be assault grabbing someone and asking a question is not need to stop being such little pussies the kind of people that call the police because someones dog shit on their lawn misdemeanor assault in some states called battery is actually a very low bar to meet it doesnt require significant injury much less longterm or permanent injury pain is enough to suffice for bodily harm at that level
SubredditDrama,not_removed,somewhat related story my brothers bike got stolen a few years ago because he didnt lock it up he reported the bike stolen to the local police office and went to school the thief was apparently a very smart guy and took the bike to school too so when my brother arrived he did see the bike and walked straight to the police office and since they didnt had anything to do they observed the bike for hours until the thief arrived they took the bike from him and gave the bike back we talked to our insurance and insured all of our bikes as long as they are locked up which turned out to be a smart move because on the next day the bike got stolen again the argument about the police not doing shit about stolen bikes is wrong especially in somewhat small towns and pulling kids from their bikes to ask them where they got them is at least a shit move
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my dad drove around for weeks ripping people off the bikes that were the same demanding to know where they got it some people arent crazy yeah lots of people arent but your dads not one of them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nice brigade you got here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im calling bollocks right of the bat £ for bmxs for him and is sister
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if my kids were confronted in such a way the internet dad in me would be going to jail the real dad in me would be calling the cops after a heated exchange
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my cousin was riding his bike down the road while his boyfriend was using a handcycle beside him a man in that age group intentionally swerved to hit my cousin he then proceeded to get out of the car and pummel my cousin shouting i know what you did faggot over and over and over again until the cops showed up and pulled him off my cousin never did anything to the man not a single damn thing and now he has ptsd about middle aged white men driving beside him which living in michigan means hes terrified a lot of the time this dad is an asshole plain and simple maybe he didnt break a jaw like the guy who attacked my cousin did or break a few ribs but there is still the terror that he could have if he wanted to bright side is that since the attack started with a vehicle my cousin was able to get a settlement out of the insurance company which pretty much guarantees that that man will never be able to afford to drive again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man the dramas coming from inside the bike
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love the progression what are you going to do if your bike gets stolen sit around and cry fuck that we went out and worked to get them back we found out who it was then we couldnt do anything about it but we fucked with innocent people for no reason first so ha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,year olds that hadnti call a parent to explain where the bike came from years ago mind you i am not sure how much of this is true
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in the usa yea any reason to sue somebody for tens of thousands of dollars
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just choked and died on my laughter when i read this i dont give a fuck if its batshit insane that shit was so funny my heart damn near stopped when i read it the mental image is absolutely beautiful i want to have coffee with his dad sounds like an entertainingly eccentric person
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but you admit it was still a really shitty thing to do right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it kind of is assault though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your dad was grabbing children off their bikes how did he not get his ass kicked by the other dads
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but it is assault and or battery most likely with increased penalty because it involves children
SubredditDrama,not_removed,overly expensive bikes overly violent dad have we found aj sopranos reddit account
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and in the real fucking world your dad committed assault and battery and is an asshole lol hes editing his comments now with username pings because hes b if youre still reading this he did if he forced people off their bikes thats assault and battery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah no in the real world vigilante justice is illegal you go after someone and assault them because youre a tough guy and you just bought yourself an arrest at the very least in the real world tough guy dumbass
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good point but counter point this is the real world is what you said that means i could had at least called the police on your father for harassment thats with anyone hes forcing people off their bikes thats basically bullying in a way but as you said this is the real world so in the real world if i was to force someone or interrogate someone for information i could easily be jailed as someone whos advocating violence to someone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you seriously think that a grown man aggressively grabbing and questioning most likely innocent teenagers is an acceptable action in the real fucking world i sincerely hope youre trolling because thats some pretty maladjusted shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you understand that putting your hands on someone without their permission is battery you keep saying he didnt commit any offence but earlier said that he was ripping people off their bikeswas he doing that with the power of his mind well probably not because people that do that kind of thing dont tend to have much of a mind but you get my drift
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you or your dad ever grab me and rip me off anything im pulling out my mace and calling edit oh and a bonus i just remembered my boyfriend said i can have a taser the other day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if they were there parents could of bought it for them a few years ago or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in the usa yea and much of the common wealth any reason to sue somebody for tens of thousands of dollars even in america you cant win a lawsuit without proving damages
SubredditDrama,not_removed,notice that i was talking about criminal charges above the tort is a lower bar of any offensive conduct but generally recovery would be limited to actual damages we inherited that tort as did australia canada and a bunch of other places from english common law
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it kind of is assault though though i think its actually battery but ianal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its kind of not though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because they werent children just people making assumptions but its okay im just laughing at everyone getting so angry about something that happened like years ago haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,once again no children were harmed in the making of this story
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he might wanna get therapy started early
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you got me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you originally blew it out proportion by saying he was ripping people off bikes which is assault and battery even by the strictest definition my guess is that he basically just flagged them down and asked them where they got the bike but that doesnt sound as dramatic so you exaggerated to get responses and you reaped what sowed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not trolling when you tell people you are trolling youre doing quite the opposite now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,depends on what you mean by shitty battery or assault charges shitty probably not dont know the legal definitions police should be involved and maybe some sort of charge placed shitty yeah you dont go around stopping people and inspecting their property because maybe theyre a thief
SubredditDrama,not_removed,depends on the local definitions at least in the states some have different laws for assault and battery and some have just assault
SubredditDrama,not_removed,depends on local laws if dad didnt actually cause injury just manhandled these kids it would be degree harassment here in oregon
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey you do you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it literally is what with assault and battery being defined as the act of threatening a person while making physical contact with them i mean you can argue that it was minor assault and battery and that he might not have gotten in trouble if the police were called but its literally by definition assault and battery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the only thing people are responding to is your inability to understand the definition of assault and battery which is happening right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the source of the problem is that you see your dad as the good guy maybe it doesnt occur to you but to everyone else your dad is just some random asshole acting aggressively you know his reason and trust he wouldnt be violent no one else does in fact it seems likely he would be violent seeing as hes been putting his hands on others
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so he was grabbing random adults off the street who apparently ride bikes everywhere yea he definitely would have gotten his ass kicked in my neighborhood
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont believe you i think you made up that detail when confronted over your father being an ass
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no parents are perfect they all make mistakes and its only natural for you to defend your dad who was probably thinking he was just trying to do right by you kids doesnt mean he wasnt in the wrong to harass those other children or a bit of a creep for it can you imagine how an equally overprotective parent would react if they saw your dad harassing their kid like that probably wouldnt end too well thats why people are making criticisms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao yea you dont live in the ghetto yet you still got your punk ass bike jacked talk about whos soft
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh lol i assumed you were because a mod told you to leave the thread else where youre still wrong tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre not well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes taking me to go buy a taser you dumbass the conversation went would you feel more comfortable if you had a taser yeah that would make me feel safer okay next week well go get a taser
SubredditDrama,not_removed,removed for personal attacks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was fun while it lasted there hasnt been a reply for a while now im bored
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive had fun thats all that matters in the end
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats enough please take it off thread thank you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because it quite clearly isnt assault and grabbing someone and calling it battery is pathetic and i find it fucking hilarious how soft these people are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,awwwww i just wrote a snappy comeback
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol its a bot this is the second time ive seen someone tell it off today but this is somehow sadder than being a grammar nazi being so much of a grammar nazi that writing a bot is a more efficient use of your time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,removed for slurs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rbotsrights
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats enough please take it off thread thank you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im confused as to why you think its not assault andor battery its not an opinion its just the definition of the words when you make physical contact with somebody while threatening or acting threateningly its assault and battery it has nothing to do with anybody being soft or not or anybody thinking its on par with punching somebody in the face or stabbing them or whatever what youre doing here is like saying stealing a quarter isnt theft because its not that big of a deal and nobodys really that put out by it but it literally is theft thats just the definition
SubredditDrama,not_removed,safer from crazy people like you you already wished i die a horrible death because i cant and wont assault people and use things to defend myself so if we could just stop and maybe seek mental help for shits and giggles
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i know its abbot i still like telling it to fuck off with the hope that someone sees it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes flamebaiting dont feed the flames
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dammit i cant hate you youre just doing your job society is really the one to blame here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the whole thread is starting to feel like the user in question doing callouts and crap i cant enjoy this popcorn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he didnt really seem to be flamebaiting in the linked thread though i dont know why it would be different here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,very good its only your own time youre wasting here so as long as you keep replying ill keep telling you forcibly removing somebody from a bicycle is the very definition of assault and battery its bafflingly stupid for you to not understand this after its been explained to you so many times you can argue that its not that serious and id probably agree with you to a degree but you cant keep saying the sky is not blue and have anybody think youre anything but dumb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah im a part of the bdsm community and ive had more than one boyfriend you wanna know the kicker i had a girlfriend for months when i was and then i was a bridesmaid at her wedding after i broke up with her this is so fun and you literally said you hoped i spent the rest of my life in a hospital not breathing on my own
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this whole thing is pathetic hahaha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my concern isnt really what hes doing there but what hes doing here i removed both comments please refrain from furthering the conversation as i asked thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sure if he had been flamebaiting in the linked thread doesnt that make him a troll and thus not eligible for srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if we suspect a troll we usually flair the thread as possible troll if its an obvious or known troll we would likely remove it however it is entirely possible for an op to start serious and then once it gets to srd double down and just start shit to start shit and not back down happens all the time regardless hes flamebaiting and it was removed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they sound more like helpdesk employees that real tech workers what a slapfight over nothing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not going to pretend i understood anything beyond google
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from what i understand he looks like hes being pedantic a dns service is mostly for hosting where as icmp echo service is specifically for sending little packets of data and waiting for a response people ping googles dns because its a fast way to check if theyre connect to the internet googles server responds to the ping
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well this time i understood packets of data and people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one person is using google to see if their internet connection is down the other person is worried that this will use up all of googles tubes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,think of it as this a company has a giant book with address information and anybody can call them if they want to know where person x lives thats basically dns or domain name service except with website urls and ip addresses pc where is googlecom dns server its at pc thanks bby now say you think your telephone line isnt working properly what you could do is call them and see if you get a response from them thats the icmp bit its basically the computer going hey you there and the server receiving it saying yeah im here if they dont get a reply back they know somethings not right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a common troubleshooting technique when dealing with internet problems is to send a little bit of data to a website asking basically can you hear me and seeing if you get an answer a lot of people use google for this because a google will answer you as long as they are up and b if google is down it means that the bombs are falling and all of us are going to die within a week the angry guy is upset that people do this because he thinks it is abusing googles bandwith which is a bit like being concerned that someone might melt a glacier by lighting a match in antarctica in the dead of winter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh god not the css
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this will be gone i think but damn is that guy a child or what sounds like a script kiddy to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey danjojo thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because no drama for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no leftist is innocent and hence not murder its self defence this is insane you are insane took the words right out of my mouth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i do disagree with some of his views on jews and nonwhites but he has never called for a genocide the sad part is that this is a pretty high bar nowadays also the rest of that thread is lunacy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no leftist is innocent and hence not murder its self defence and yet people are surprised that libertarianism doesnt have the best reputation knowing the violent nature of the left it is self defence not presumptive defence im assuming he means preemptive rather than presumptive but hes still completely wrong killing others based on the premise that they will eventually engage in violent behavior is the definition of preemptive defense which is also called murder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,worth noting that this guy is a moderator for rtd speaks volumes about that sub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hm i kind of think social programs are good sometimes kill him in self defense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my god those people are fucking delusional its scary that those kind of people actually fucking exist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh please tred on me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt know that people were unironically ancaps huh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i advocate second retialation and never first strike its literally not murder hes in for one hell of a shock if hes ever brought up in front of a judge for this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so much for the tolerant right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he is being downvoted because you fucks came out of your hellholes thereby initiating violence against this community therefore proving his point that every sane well meaning human must be always ready and on guard against you whodathunk the pioneers of the new era of selfdetermination would be the crumpliest of crumpling tissue paper
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this reminds me of the httpswwwkenzercocomhackmasterracesphpgrel from hackmaster they are a very honorable people yet they realized if they were wiped out nobody would be around to avenge them thus they seek preemptive vengeance upon all other races
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nothing is more anarchist than celebrating a massmurdering fascists favorite execution method
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if someone vocally supports theft imprisonment and murder of peaceful people then can we consider this person peaceful asking hard questions here are people who support murder dangerous no hence we should murder all of them solid logic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so uh what kind of alternate reality are these guys living in that they think lefties are advocating murdering political opponents i hope that guy is a troll but i doubt it by the subs he mods this shit is not ok free speech goes too far when you are literally advocating murdering half the population because they disagree with you i wish the admins would crack down on this shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people on these flingpolitical subreddits are all insane whenever im having a bad day i head on over to a sub like anarchocapitalism and go at least im not one of these miserable fucks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im just glad this kind of human filth hides away in their containment boards
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someone brings up far left reddits similar propensity towards political murder as an excuse to affirm the horseshoe theory and circle jerk over how both sides are the same and how the true answer is in the middle which somehow strangely is always the solution proposed by establishment liberals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reminder that saying bash the fash is banable now according to admins but this shit is ok by them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,somthing somthing horseshoe theory
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i say we get a royal rumble have antifa ancaps ghazi srs td all of them go at it in a hell in the cell match
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we can all take solace in the fact that the biggest impact the people in that sub may manage in their lives is to have their simple minded lunacy coopted by rich people with a political agenda
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is sad the guy obviously has problems and needs help
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i fully sympathize with tankies and that evil prick deserves the gulag
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly you can name them however you want the bottom line is that communism fascism and other totalitarian regimes are awful democracy or similar regimes arent flawless but still way better fascism is not even relevant today as i cant recall a regime that even comes close to this except for isis or the talibans maybe burma but communism is still viewed as a solution even when it failed by itself when i want to feel good i watch the ceausescus execution thats how tyrants should die
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from thegreatroh in that thread no leftist is innocent and hence not murder its self defence hoo boy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,spoiler alert it isnt double spoiler alert i was obligated to say that to keep my smug south park neutral cred intact
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hilarious thing is he probably loves complaining about antifa even though they are both using the exact same logic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are they not satirising left wing anarchists when they say no fascist is innocent and its self defence if you murder them at least thats what i thought they were attempting to do why all the downvotes whats your problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive been consuming a fair bit of content on propaganda and fascismracial superiority especially makes an incredibly important point if racial superiority and purity is a fundamental aspect of governmental policysocietal organization then genocide is practically the only logical outcome
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is not a genocide it is a peaceful ideological and cultural cleansing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love how its disagree jesus christ hitler was a little too wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thing is most jews and nonwhites would be brutally slaughtered by them according to their kill anyone left of libertarianism bit most all jews and minorities are solidly liberal its just an attempt to disguise their shit to make it more palatable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like spencer but i do think calling him a nazi and acting like hes public enemy number one is ridiculous the same people calling him a nazi also defend socialism and communism which killed far more people than hitler there is a communist sub which apologizes for stalin and mao who combined killed million people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this doesnt even make sense by targeting leftist extremists on the grounds of selfdefense theyre doing the exact thing the leftist extremists did to get themselves targeted by ancaps
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wouldnt even call it libertarianism the actual libertarian ideology generally starts with ya know liberalism these guys are just the kind of asshole who call themselves libertarian which merely means they want weed kiddy sex slavery andor freedom to be violent jackasses with racist beliefs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt that covered under that stand your ground thing or is that just cops
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats like saying progressives deserve a bad rep because communists exist most libertarians in the us are just small government anti war republicans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,td is a rational sub everything else is a leftist conspiracy ive got that one right yeah
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i miss the romney years where the conservatives were regular people who had different views than you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rich coming from upuncheverynazi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rthedonalds embrace of pinochet in recent weeks is truly beyond parody nobody in the right mind looks at pinochets chile and thinks what a great system place was an economically dysfunctional police state like chile is actually a stunning example of how everything these people believe is verifiable horseshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so basically rkillthosewhodisagree but unironically
SubredditDrama,not_removed,met one in real lfe who inherited enough money to retire while in undergrad funny how that works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i used to know one he constantly misquoted immanuel kant and took himself extremely seriously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i lived with one for a while really smart guy a math phd student at the time but some things were completely out of his element
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im friends with one it can be pretty enlightening when arguing with them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anarchocapitalists think labels are magic if they dont use the word murder its not the same thing just like if they privatize the state its not government because they dont use that word for it and theyre anarchists rather than monarchistsfeudalists because they use the former term and not the latter two
SubredditDrama,not_removed,grunge elves conjures so many great ideas
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when youre encouraging murder it doesnt matter if its free speech its also hate speech and inciting violence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the one where they spend their time laughing at pinochets favourite cruel and unusual execution method and assume that other people are just like them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what kind of alternate reality are these guys living in that they think lefties are advocating murdering political opponents probably the one where they can wander over to any of dozens of lefty subs on reddit and find leftists doing just that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no no no dont you see bash the fash is clearly the only serious call to violence on this site these little tykes were just messing around boys will be boys s its great that fascists seem to be the only protected class on this god forsaken site
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is mia best girl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someone misuses the term horseshoe theory to stop any attempt to draw comparisons between two groups of people because being totally ideologically opposed means they therefore have absolutely nothing at all in common and never can and if you try to point out that they both like killing people well thats just horseshit theory goodsir
SubredditDrama,not_removed,royal rumble and hell in a cell are two different match types you fucking mark
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bah god thats umarusamas music
SubredditDrama,not_removed,antifa activists do not call for mass murdering fascists assassinations of individual leaders is rejected nearly unanimously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also nap
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am andrew ryan and im here to ask you a question is a man not entitled to the sweat of his fedora or to advocate the murder of leftists no says the man in rpolitics thats horrific no says the man in the rcirclejerk only the euphoric shall be sprayed with mountain dew no says the man in rsubredditdrama are you insane i rejected those answers instead i chose something different i chose the impossible i chose ranarchocapitalism a subreddit where the edgy would not fear rcringe where the euphoric would not be bound by some phony gods blessing where the brave would not be constrained by the statist and with the sweat of your fedora ranarchocapitalism an become your subreddit as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,left wing anarchists aka anarchists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not youll occasionally see libertarians ancaps and american conservatives go to bat for pinochet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean fascist implicit goals are ethnic genocide its an actual end game goal of them not sure why you think thats worth defending
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tbh i think this is all a waste of time we clearly all want to murder eachother might as well get started riot in the streets fire the nukes burn it all down doesnt matter why
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres a big difference between the people pinochet killed and the nazis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,genocide or slavery why not put them to work with things that are beneath the superior race s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ollys videos are great
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sourcing a propagandist for information on propaganda wew
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mass deportation is actually the more popular belief actually
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while i respect him for debunking white supremacsist myths he can also go fuck himself for supporting violence i dont care if he was an white suprmacist dont fucki g punch people period
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hm we need a word to shorten that down any suggestions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well look at communist zimbabwe after the white farmers were ethnically cleansed famine poverty medieval economy north best korea and venezuela are leftists wet dreams but no hollywood superstar ever threatened to emigrate there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most all jews and minorities are solidly liberal if that was true israel would be a very different place there are plenty of conservative people of all races
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but i do think calling him a nazi and acting like hes public enemy number one is ridiculous but now his tone changed as he began to tell the audience of more than people mostly young men what they had been waiting to hear he railed against jews and with a smile quoted nazi propaganda in the original german america he said belonged to white people whom he called the children of the sun a race of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but now in the era of presidentelect donald j trump were awakening to their own identity as he finished several audience members had their arms outstretched in a nazi salute mr spencer called out hail trump hail our people and then hail victory — the english translation of the nazi exhortation sieg heil the room shouted back one wonders if these people are people at all or instead soulless golem he said referring to a jewish fable about the golem a clay giant that a rabbi brings to life to protect the jews
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like spencer but i do think calling him a nazi he is a nazi in every sense that can be relevant to someone living in the us today who isnt years old the same people calling him a nazi also defend socialism and communism which killed far more people than hitler people calling themselves communists but who instituted systems of government which didnt even resemble socialism killed more people than hitler sure they also were in charge of far larger populations for far longer and didnt have genocide as an express ideological goal unlike hitler stalin and mao who combined killed million people look stalin and mao were fucking awful human beings responsible for many millions of deaths you dont need to massively inflate that number to make them look worse in fact doing so undermines your point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,million i thought it was googity gorillion billion trillion gajillion you people really need to get your stories straight lmao
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well no itd be like saying communists deserve a bad reputation because tankies exist and id be the first to judge communists if their subreddit upvoted well we just need to kill capitalists and conservatives im not judging conservatives because of how libertarians act im judging libertarians
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or mccain who said something along the lines of i disagree with obama on many issues but he is still a decent man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well gingrich predated romney
SubredditDrama,not_removed,punching is the exact same thing as murder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wont someone pls think of the poor innocent nazis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its just a joke 😉
SubredditDrama,not_removed,social programs genocidal programs whats the difference
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rbeetlejuiceing rbeetlejuicing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as they fuckers fantasize about it theyll never have to balls to follow through with it im sure thats true for the vast majority of them but you only need one dylann roof or anders breivik in the bunch for a tragedy to happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can we get a subreddit together to fund reddditors to fight each other irl id do pay per view for that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i say this as somebody on the far far left of the political spectrum the left absolutely does have a problem when it comes to glorifying violence just look at ranarchism i dont want to picture any of those motherfuckers with a gun though theyd probably shoot themselves by accident before killing anybody else same time at least those people for all their juvenile rage genuinely desire a society where people respect and help one another guy in this thread just wants a corrupt police state even if he pretends he doesnt no matter what side of the political spectrum youre on theres idiots though sometimes the ideology is the idiocy and not the individual if you get my drift
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the left wingers fantasize about punching people it doesnt stop at punching people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the ancaps in post grad and academic world are all frumpy and look pretty poor
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the categorical imperative is just like the nap right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really like me a dozen subs where thats happening thatd be good drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mean the people who are extremisit boy if thats the case maybe we should hate on all ideals because taken to any extreme any idea is pretty dangerous so why take the risk hell lets just start over kill anyone who believes in an ism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn you rfullcommunism your ideas are shit but your memes are so dank
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you could combine them get a ladder and you have you drag people to the top and thrown them out of the ring like in when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted ft through an announcers table
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what the fuck do you even read the comments on ranarchism these days there are plenty of people who support propaganda of the deed and think that its always acceptable to murder fascists they masturbate daily at the thought of violence and now youre trying to paint them as the restrained sensible ones
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same for full communism and gulags
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a man wearing a bioshock tshirt right now at work this made me happy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do they really fit on the left vs right spectrum i always thought they were more of their own thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,occasionally
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont because my life isnt politics god what is wrong with so much of reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yassss httpiimgurcomtadvreepng
SubredditDrama,not_removed,murdering a child for being born a jew is just as horrible and indefensible as murdering a child because their parents are subversives edit i misinterpreted your statementi completely agree that the vast majority of people pinochet killed were innocents and he was a huge piece of shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or peaceful ethnic cleansing just politely ask the unwanted millions of people to leave and if they resist well thats on them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then you run into the same issue the nazis ran into where do you displace possibly tens of millions of people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,before the nazis final solution they planned on just deporting the jews turns out you cant just displace millions of people who dont want to be moved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,his argument as i understand it is basically that racial superiority is an inherently violent ideology any future that includes racial superiority as a government position must in some way support genocide or mass deportation which would lead to extreme human suffering i dont think he necessarily advocates it at least not explicitly but he definitely doesnt discount it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whitewash
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in the us is what they mean
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also and this is controversial the great chinese famaine which killed as much as million people was the product of incompetence not maliciousnes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people calling themselves communists but who instituted systems of government which didnt even resemble socialism ah yes the no true communist argument just stop it man you are defending a ideology that has killed millions for fuck sake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just an internet knowitall flair potential right there but i love my current flair standing your ground has always seemed very unreasonable to me as a legal standard because of things like trayvon martin but being able to stab someone whos broken into your home while screaming get the fuck out of my house seems reasonable enough though i think trying to persuade them first perhaps by screaming get the fuck out of my house is also reasonable i dont think that attacking someone physically for a nonviolent crime is reasonable though and burglary isnt a violent crime so i feel ideologically inconsistent here certainly if someone breaks into my house i want them the fuck out of my house immediately because i have nowhere else to go but on the other hand theyre not necessarily offering harm to me they just want to help me out by taking my jewelry computing equipment and television to a pawn shop on my behalf no one said they wanted to rape or murder me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anarcho capitalists are not libertarians they are often at odds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gingrich is terribly cruel and his destruction of the office of technology assessment is a lot of why we got here but he does want a moon base so its okay that hes in politics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the wise man bowed his head solemnly and spoke theres actually zero difference between good bad things you imbecile you fucking moron
SubredditDrama,not_removed,etral murder even if the most restrictuve laws dont say it is letral murder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its still bad enough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,such a casually violent username implies a desire for more than punching as does their post history also i think thats what physicalreeeeeeeeeemoval wants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,captain america would be proud
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when a nazi says that everyone rees about joaks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this was one of the craziest things about how long it took the admins to take reuropean down half the subreddit read like serious breivik copypasta
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also alexander bissonette here in canada
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as ive said before we should give an island to the various edgy leftist groups on reddit so that they can recreate anarchist catalonia or whatever other classless society they want but just for fun send an equal number of anarchocapitalists with them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i rather there be duels
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can find it pretty easily in rfullcommunism and related subs it can depend on whether or not you see bash the fash as a call to violence or not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes lefty extremists just as a reminder heres what i was responding to and what you wrote so uh what kind of alternate reality are these guys living in that they think lefties are advocating murdering political opponents now obviously you were trying to make it seem like only rightwing extremists advocate for political violence im glad you came around to admitting that leftwing extremists do it to i imagine that was a hard thing to do but im proud of you for doing it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like the prominence of dank memes is directly tied to the popularity of the altright movement on the internet its only natural that the left fights back
SubredditDrama,not_removed,antifa and anarchism are not interchangeable and ranarchism isnt a reliable source of information about real world anarchists let alone antifa activists seriously if you go to a meeting of a local antifa group and talk like those clowns they will most likely think that you must be some sort of agent provocateur the nearly uniform opinion is that they must be prepared for violent hooligan style confrontations but that murdering nazis in a somewhat stable democracy is counterproductive and unjustified
SubredditDrama,not_removed,absolutely tankies can fuck right off too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes plain anarchism tends to refer to some kind of anarchocommunism as far as im aware
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do they really fit on the left vs right spectrum well yes theyre as far left as you can get being completely opposed to involuntary hierarchies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anarchism is a branch of the socialist movement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah most days ranarchocapitalism literally has more nazi content than anything else at this point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what the fuck also minarchism has to be the silliest name for a type of government out there even before you realize its an idea of small government that has room for secret police with attack helicopters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see this claim and where does it happen the only person ive had provide some sort of evidence managed to change the story times
SubredditDrama,not_removed,welcome to the internet heres your complimentary pitchfork im currently drunk and i suggest you join me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are plenty of people who channel their obsession with politics in a positive directionnoneofthemareancaps
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the actual answer to your question is teenagers and adult children with nothing they actually value
SubredditDrama,not_removed,echo chambers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no glorifyingadvocating for violence in srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not aware that allende or his government had people killed for being subversives so what is your point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres also the fact that people will not willingly be deported from their homeland
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someone wrote an article on medium right after the election basically detailing how the deportation force proposed by trump would work basically it came down to the holocaust you cant forcibly throw over ten million people out of the country without killing thousands or millions along the way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,soon to be uninhabitable areas its genocide either way you cut it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was thinking more a gen sound
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah yes the no true communist argument just because you put it in quotes in a pithy phrasing based on the term no true scotsman doesnt mean youve invalidated what youre responding to just because someone called themselves a communist doesnt mean they meet the definition of the term any more than north korea calling itself the democratic peoples republic of korea makes it a democracy or do you think thats a no true democrat argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nothing gets past this guy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the interesting thing is the vast majority of societies agree that simple theft or trespassing doesnt deserve the death penalty immediately that it would be disproportionate but a lot of people would agree in someones right to forcibly defined themselves and expel intruders into their homes even if this results in the death of the intruder theres an interesting shift in the mentality here a proper trial isnt sufficient to pass the death penalty for a crime but if the crime is committed in front of the victim the death penalty is suddenly ok if perhaps not outright encouraged i wonder whether this is something to do with fulfilling peoples hero fantasies rather than justice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is it because libertarians are still statist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but think of the poor nazis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you say that about professional boxers too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im going to assume your incoherent comment meant but when nazis do it everyone loses their minds in which case my response is the nazi ideology literally calls for genocide the communists doesnt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then the crowd gets into it on reddit brilliant infinite money and demand right there someone call elon musk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i honestly forget anarchists exist because theyre so irrelevant i dont know for a political fringe anarchism manages to insert itself into the public view pretty frequently maybe this is just my own personal biases talking but anarchists are pretty goddamn active and in certain specific contexts theyve had a massive influence on events like milos whole downfall was a direct result of anarchists in berkeley lighting a generator on fire in the big picture likewise occupy wall street was started by anarchists and more broadly a lot of the tactics and organizational methods the more mainstream left has started to use in recent years came out of anarchist movements and ideas consensus decision making for example or decentralized organizations blm im actually pretty amazed at how anarchism manages to stay influential despite the fact that everybody but anarchists hates the shit out of anarchism yeah there are violent leftists that exist but my point is they usually resort to hooliganism like looting or beating people up rather than murdering people in the us anyway a greek anarchist group just took credit for sending letter bombs to the imf a few weeks ago but other than that youre right the kids on ranarchism mainly just fetishize rioting and property destruction a lot of the republicans i know however are truly fucking misanthropic in a way thats hard to fathom when donald trumps yemen raid killed a bunch of children for no reason the most popular response from conservatives i know was some variation of well maybe they shouldnt have helped a terrorist first of all there apparently was no terrorist second we killed children which i think speaks for itself ive heard leftists sayadvocate some insane shit but i never get the impression that they dont give a shit about the distinction between guilt and innocence or that violence is a meh issue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bash the fash is a little different from kill all lefties fascists are a very specific group that sorta did commit genocide
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay thats one he still has more to go at a minimum
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont disagree with you but i think thats a bad line of argument nobody youd argue with would agree on the meanings of any of the terms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but they wouldnt give free healthcare to the people shot by attack helicopters so its really much better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,have you been paying any attention to srd this week the leftist subs are currently throwing a and calling literally everyone fascists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i might not like the dude but they reckon milo is a fascist which is just false same with trump and they think the police force is fascist as well and by association supporters of these people and the police often get attacked for it by left wing activists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lets do it whats step
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what we have here is failure to communicate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,general population maintenance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its more that litteraly every regime that has called itself communistic has ended in bloodbaths either it is a utopic ideology that is impossible to achive or it is a idology as bad as nazism when it comes to people dying either way everyone who supports it deserves shit you are litteraly defending an ideology that has killed millions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i realize the ideological inconsistency i would freak out if someone broke into my house but id also do my best not to attack them physically because thats a separate thing on the other hand terrified people are stupid and stupid people do stupid things and its reasonable to be terrified when someone breaks into your house i just dont think they should die for it or anything but i want them the fuck out of there right this very second
SubredditDrama,not_removed,first its defonite nazis then its people who are suspected of being nazis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is getting absurd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are also many of us on the left that are disillusioned with the outwardly violent impulses of other leftists and try to curb it right wingers are not known to be altruistic or overly concerned with each others actions so you wont see much protest from the peaceful right wingers when the violent ones start calling for blood not my problem and all especially if they live in yemen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how does him being a registered democrat prove he committed the shooting because he was a registered democrat post hoc ergo propter hoc is bad logic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,breitbart
SubredditDrama,not_removed,left wing democrat choose one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,warning breitbart link
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a lefty so im not defending it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look at the users rleftwithoutedge theres a reason they ended up there and not in one of the other leftistanarchistsocialistcommunist subreddits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably because they are ignorant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,free i think you mean stolen from hardworking mining conglomerates you sound like a statist whose existence is aggression against libertopia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,milo is a fascist every view he has includes to demonetisation of other minorities
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fermentation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you know of the allende government having political opponents killed then im genuinely interested because i havent heard anything like that from what i know the allende government was terrified of a strong police force
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats dystopian as fuck and i love it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not a communist but your argument is pretty terrible you realize how many current democracies are the result of revolutionary wars right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its more that litteraly every regime that has called itself communistic has ended in bloodbaths the vast majority of violent revolutions end in bloodbaths particularly in nations lacking strong democratic traditions thats not something unique to communist revolutions most of which were heavily influenced by one very specific revolution and supposedly communist ideology which didnt even follow the preconditions laid out by the originator of communism also theres a distinct tendency for capitalist nations to intervene in supposedly socialist nations nascent ones in ways that make the situation worse there are all kinds of reasons to conclude that the common flaws of the systems youre referring to were factors other than a nominal attachment to the idea of communism you are litteraly defending an ideology that has killed millions inasmuch as capitalism has killed millions or feudalism has killed millions or republicanism or democracy lots of people have killed people in the name of things even when they werent actually pursuing something that looked like the thing they were claiming to be fighting for and that includes plenty of good ideas im not a communist but blaming communism for what people who claimed to be communists did in the pursuit of something that clearly wasnt communism is well dumb if youre going to criticize communism do it on the flaws of the actual ideology itself there are plenty of grounds for criticism there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in a home invasion scenario the victim rarely has the time or ability to properly assess the level of threat the invader presents is he there to murder you or rob you once discovered how will he react is he under the influence of drugs or otherwise mentally unstable and will act erratically therefore people are generally ok with self defense in this scenario in many us states like say texas you are legally able assume the worst of home invaders and therefore lethal force is almost always legally justified without some pretty extreme extenuating circumstances and the general culture is very accepting and supportive of self defense in other places the results could be very different
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you feel that you should be able to kick someone out of your house either by physically coercing them yourself or calling the police to do it for you why not just concede that there are times where nonviolence can be permissably responded to with violence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you just unironically go first they came for the nazis you should sincerely look into a mirror and selfreflect
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you do realize that the famous first they came for the quote is in reference to people targeted by the nazis right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well shit in that case someone call bill gates hes probably got enough to found it from perpetuities
SubredditDrama,not_removed,democrats in the usa are right center guys hes right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im also leftist but ill totally defend it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can back this up explicit calls to horrible violence are common all over reddit however in real life i hear them way way way more from those on the far right than anyone else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but being right isnt what makes an argument good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he also literally believes that the rights you receive and your status in society should be based on your utility to the state that is cut and dry fascism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while fascists are racist not all racists are fascist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aaaaand this is why you far left crazies can fuck right off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry what i meant was your use of the article the made the meaning of your initial statement a bit ambiguous you wrote theres a big difference between the people pinochet killed and the nazis i interpreted your statement as meaning something to the effect of the people killed by pinochet were different from nazis however the inclusion of the aforementioned article might make the sentence read as something to the effect of the people pinochet killed were different from the people the nazis killed i got the impression that readphilosophydamnit interpreted the sentence in the latter way ie pinochet killed subversives while the nazis killed jews and both are horrible and indefensible i didnt get the impression that readphilosophydamnit was putting forth the idea that allende rather than pinochet was in the business of killing subversives wont know for sure one way or the other til someone clarifies a position though either way i enjoyed writing this post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i read that as dystopian assfuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,france needed one extremely bloody revolution another brief but nasty revolution another brief revolution a nasty loss in war another nasty loss in war and another nasty loss in war to get to their current fifth republic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do it on the flaws of the actual ideology itself there are plenty of grounds for criticism there which i have i do belive that the problem is more that it is an utopic ideology that is impossible to create in reality doesnt stop idiots from saying it will work this time i promise ofc communists have no and will never have any real world power so im not exactly worried about them the rising popuöarity of racist rethoric is far more concerning but it is still annoying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on the other hand the odds of it being a home invasion or violent robbery are very low also the same argument could be made about someone following you at night yet the standards for self defense outside your home are much higher
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the cops are trained in this im not i dont carry or own pistols rifles or shotguns for a lot of reasons but one of them is that i received my firearms training in the military if you shoot someone in the military you mean it its never a deterrent its straightup shooting someone with a oneshotonekill mentality plus which ive never found that adding firearms to a situation tends to defuse it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is it really that far of a leap from punching people you know are nazis to punching people you think are nazis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you actully look into what some of the guys at ranarchism says you will understand what he means those guys think that all liberals and capitalists shouod be killed too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes of course but the communist would have done the same thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont see anything producive i could say to you so i think ill ignore you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some political opinions do make people crazy isis nazis the khmer rouge etc obviously most political ideologies dont but we shouldnt dismiss facts like these out of hand we need to watch the ideologies we accept as normal for warning signs like these because benevolent ideas can warp into pathological violence easily
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what are we defending again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he also got his fans to harass leslie jones to an absurd degree insanely racist statememts death threats the whole nine yards im not saying anything about fascism here just pointing out that he doesnt need to directly tell his supporters to target someone the mere implication galvanized his fans into doing what they did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anyone that supports thinks milo is rational has a serious fucking problem he scraps the bottom of the barrel of human society looking for followers so out of touch with the world they incapable if seeing how little sense his comments make
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so youre a cuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah i see what you mean i meant the first interpretation there are a few pinochet lovers posting replies so i assumed readphilosophydamnit was one of them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats the dystopian future where pence does a coup and makes it illegal to be gay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think im having an effect on you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which i have i do belive that the problem is more that it is an utopic ideology that is impossible to create in reality well i mean ill grant that thats technically a criticism of the ideology itself but criticism of the ideology itself would usually imply actually crafting an argument for how thats an inherent property of the ideology rather than just saying but look at these cases where someone called themselves that thing and it went terribly wrong when people didnt even try to put the ideology into practice clearly its impossible to actually implement personally if i were going to write up a criticism regarding communism i think i would go with the advantages of having money as a unit of account and exchange allowing the society to take advantage of the efficiency advantages offered by markets or maybe i would argue that the goal of a stateless society seems like an undesirable goal to me due to the advantages a state offers when it comes to coordinating action and protecting minorities
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while i agree with your thoughts on the matter the always shoot to kill thing is a standard that gun owners in general use not just the military the idea being that the only situation you should ever be firing your gun at someone is if your life is in immediate danger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the cops are trained in this im not that doesnt change the premise if you believe the cops are justified in physically coercing this person to leave your house then you arent fundamentally opposed to using violence against somebody nonviolent you just think there are more specific conditions that must be met just like how im not saying its okay to beat someone to death because they got your order wrong youre saying its not okay to use violence unless you are properly trained though whether or not the police currently are is questionable to deal with these sorts of situations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats pretty absurd even if by communist you mean people toeing the line of stalinist doctrine it wasnt they who wanted to burn all of europe to ashes in a genocidal war of expansion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait what am i missing out on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you could point to a democratic communist country that never went into killing the bourgeois or confiscated private property id change some of my personal perspective until then i volunteer to punch communists in the face as i did before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he didnt tell his supporters to do any of that though he got into an argument with her and they took it on themselves to say all that stuff to her hes a nobhead but its a bit out of order to blame him for that imo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont rhink he is rational he is an idiot i just dont think he is a fascist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean they could be who knows until they clarify i just saw a bit of ambiguity in the initial wording and figured someone with the handle readphilosophydamnit probably isnt a big fan of fascism lol language is funny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shit now i wish there was some good gay dystopian fiction but i cant think of much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,somewhere out there a market socialist screams we exist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree you dont shoot someone with the thought of a disabling shot but i dont really keep up with gun owners arguments it tends to be about deterrence value and so on ive heard lots of arguments in favor of open carry in places where its stupid — supermarkets elementary schools and so on its all about signaling intent to whatever have a gun i live in an area where handgun permits are almost invariably never granted and no one carries anything i was actually taken aback when i saw someone carrying a longbow and quiver a few months ago im pretty sure it was a prop as the bow was strung and it was wet out and you never get a bowstring wet but i had no clue what the hell all that was about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you believe the cops are justified in physically coercing this person to leave your house then you arent fundamentally opposed to using violence against somebody nonviolent you just think there are more specific conditions that must be met i dont think the cops should be shooting someone either i think that they have a lot more skills in restraining and removing someone from the premises than i do as a woman with two teenaged daughters in the house what am i supposed to do a flying tackle on someone whos almost certainly taller and outweighs me who hasnt listened to my telling them to get the fuck out what if it doesnt work come to think of it what if it doesnt work on someone whos shorter and doesnt outweigh me what if tyrion lannister breaks into my house and starts draining my liquor cabinet while talking politics all right tyrion lannister would be cool and id let him kind of like just straight up wandering into someones house during filming raiding the fridge and falling asleep on his couch sure i studied handtohand combat in the military nearly years ago i really dont remember much of it and i certainly havent practiced it and i wasnt okay with learning it then except to what extent it was absolutely necessary to defend my patients i have no desire to fuck someone up i just want them out of my house the cops are used to restraining someone and theyre in current practice because they have to handcuff people who are resisting arrest with some frequency im not used to it and i havent ever done it i wouldnt call the cops to ask them to shoot the guy or even with that intention i dont need someone to be dead to be protected from them just the intention of handcuffing him and removing him burglary is still a crime a nonviolent crime but a crime
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no it is not just stop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah wich is why they didnt ally with the nazis during the first part of the war oh fucking wait
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats completely irrelevant to my point and obvious bait but valuable perspective
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah im sure thats why twitter banned him for witchhunting her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,milo is innocent free the fascist one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol at someone using standardized test data to prove a point about educational outcomes i think its pretty well established that we put too much emphasis on standardized test data by all sides of the debate i think its pretty insulting for someone who is in tfa to think that the two weeks of preparation that they receive prior to starting their placement is equal to the three years of required coursework that education majors complete id be pissed at him too dont make me go back to school i want to shitpost all day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sick burn bro i really hope there are not teachers who say sick burn bro
SubredditDrama,not_removed,here is the thing that always frustrates me on this arguments about teachers and alternative means of educationit fucking sucks being stuck in a terrible school system the high school i went to had effectively a rubber room for three teachers that sat in there all day long because they were not allowed to be around students at all but the district could not afford to go through the process of firing them as per the rate at which tfa people leave either right after or even before the end of their two year contract in those same terrible districts like the one i was stuck in the rate at which fully trained teachers stick around is not much better at all for my district its over quit within years my senior year i had four separate people attempt to teach my english class because teachers kept quitting i always find it frustrating when people who have access to good public schools are shock that people stuck in shit school systems are willing to fight for vouchers or basically anything to try and get their kids a decent education
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is there a single occupationoriented sub where the users dont circle jerk about how they work harder than everyone else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was good press though because he kept commenting on how tired he was and how much work was still left to do etc i feel its that way for any person who never worked in a different environment my exwife has a masters in public administration and a bs in business bba who is my business partner our employees wanted a raise and i thought they should get one my ex said no that if any raises were to be handed out it should go to the office team her me and office manager since we had to deal with customers more often and please them when they complained so i said next time an employee called in sick us two would cover his pools i own a swimming pool business and i mostly cover on sickvacation days so one day a guy called in sick and i took her with me it was a nice and hot day i was doing about of the with but my beautiful jewish princess looked like captain caveman by noon in the degree sun she told me to take her home and i didnt say a word my kids told me she was asleep when they got to her place after school and didnt wake till the next morning so did the pool guys get a raise no one of our repair trucks died and we spent the money on a new one being divorced sucks i still love my ex not in love but you know what i mean and shes one of my best friends butnot once while we were married did i win an argument thou now being divorced i win half of them anyways i think the teacher would have a hard time being a reporter i had a hard time just being art docent for my kids elementary classes grass is greener shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the thread is more than year old why submit now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can you imagine the outcry if there was a tfalike program for doctors well your doctor has had a summer of training in neurology so we brought him on to remove your brain tumor the good news is you are poor so you dont have a choice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,👵🏾 get to school son
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my exs brother was a middle school teacher and one of the broiest bros that ever did bro he said sick burn bro and similar lingo all the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are but almost none of us would say it in a school we know how to act professional for most of the day at least
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why couldnt they be around students
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a teacher so im admittedly super biased but there is a fuckton of work required of teachers which is buffeted by the fact that longterm salaries arent competitive with many other fields or the way other nations pay their teachers its a cool job for sure but when you look at the or its clear that its not entirely bluster that american teachers are qualitatively busy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah dreadfort
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like to hunt for unusual popcorn in unusual subreddits it makes for a nice change of pace from the current dramas of the american election harambe etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because old popcorn is gold popcorn it helps weed out some popcorn pissers too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we students never got an answer i always assumed it was for having an inappropriate relationship with a student or something i would see the three of them day in and day out sitting in a classroom reading a newspaper a novel or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,americans of all occupations work more than all other nations its kind of our thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt that place get ransacked by rfreefolk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well of course you do youre all too tough to enjoy repulsive socialist luxuries like and like the rest of us canadians get paid timbit breaks but actually americans dont work more than many other nations among the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiworkingtime countries america ranks out of thats probably the fairest assessment as it doesnt count the slavelabouresque conditions of many developing countries
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah we all know where you guys fall on working smart vs working hard
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats true i hope there can be a cultural shift sometime in my lifetime towards a more european understanding of workload that workload and mental health are connected in ways that can be managed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh yeah drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gotta make dem carriers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah it was actually modsanctioned pretty cool imo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if it makes anyone in that thread feel any better in their respective comic book publications dc and marvel have been copying ideas from each other for decades
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know why that top comment got hit with so many downvotes he never implied that marvel created postcredit scenes just that theyre associated with them which is pretty reasonable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these people are teenagers and believe everything on earth started with their birth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol yeah its called humor and marvel didnt create it no but they do inject it into moments that are suppose to be serious much to the chargin of some people black humor totally not a thing till like years ago youre argument is stupid tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oooh damn someone mentioned the airplane postcredits scene now i have to rewatch it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,guy left out smokey and the bandit though i guess that was more of a blooper real but the purpose was the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they sure have if im not mistaken nova was a copy of green lantern but ill be damned if i dont love me some nova richard rider is a cool little article on dc and marvel copying each other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh yeah some of the best heroes are a blatant rip off of another
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had the most frustrating conversation with my sister when i was trying to explain that i didnt like this thing that she liked but it was ok for her to like it but given our respective differences in reference pools i cant see the thing she likes in the same way she does
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and marvel isnt black humour some movies have a sense of humour like gotg and theres the occasional joke but most is just people being really serious about the baddie destroying the world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanos is a copy of darkseid and deadpool is a comedic version of deathstroke doomsday is essentially a hulk copy and the revengers are a avengers copy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everyone loves dick
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ironman and batman have a suspicious amount in common too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one of my favorite stories told by stan lee happened when marvel bought wonder man and started using the character dc called them up and said you know that kind of sounds like wonder woman you really shouldnt do that so marvel relented and stopped producing wonder man then dc introduces power girl while marvel has a character named power man so marvel basically went wtf dc no fair and starts running wonder man again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love dick rider
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like how pixar movies have the pixar short
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i suppose deadpool could qualify
SubredditDrama,not_removed,revengers are a avengers copy huh didnt try to cover that one up too much i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the revengers are a avengers copy the paralleluniverse avengers are an avengers copy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dick rider heh heh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and batman himself started as a barely disguised ripoff of the shadow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so youre saying dc should play pixar shorts before their moviess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,deadpool is wade wilson deathstroke is slade wilson it happens a lot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and later on green arrow was one of many mans that copied batmans popularity as a gimmick hero
SubredditDrama,not_removed,slade wilson as in the main baddie in teen titans or are there more slades
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i knew both those names just never made any kind of connection before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its got to be him the twotone mask and melee fighting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some people think that deathstroke was referred to as slade in teen titans because saying a name like deathstroke in a kids show mightve been too much i think slade sounds cooler anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,deathstroke also sounds too close to death grip to ever not be funny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ugh i was just telling my friend im such a loser for arguing on the internet i admit it i admit it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i work at the national aquarium i get the weirdest amount of hate sometimes when i used to post pictures of them on fb oddly i got very little hate from raww when i posted about one of our dolphins bdays our organizations fb page got a ton of hate when they posted that we are planning on releasing the dolphins into an openocean sanctuary down in florida one guy said that we were just going to dump them in the ocean and forget about them really
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its ok were very accepting of dolphinkin here at srd just please dont eat any srdines
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah its not like the aquarium puts any thought into rehabilitation that would be stupid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you dealt with them well its nice that people care itd be nicer if they didnt rush in with so much blind anger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,none at all we totally did not spend years figuring out the best possible procedures just gunna wing it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks when dealing with an angry person keeping your cool and debating them logically is a better approach
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont you mean flipper it antidolphin bias
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hah love it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,please please please refrain from saying gods name in vain i find it very offensive and im certain others do too thank you obvious troll
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there it is the dumbest statement ive read all week and the weeks just started as an aside why do americans and probably some other cultures treat sunday as the first day of the week
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh seems like a troll to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kyle kody kolin klassy parents right there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pretty sure my recent comment history indicates my expert level troll status i got minus on a post just yesterday expert level troll status what am i reading
SubredditDrama,not_removed,number is really pushing everyones buttons today
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes actually a pretty entertaining troll from his past history spends an equal amount of time complain about people using the lords name in vain as he does saying how the country is going to shit because you cant tell someone to kill themselves without someone being upset by it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as is tradition
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean please please please refrain from saying gods name in vain i find it very offensive and im certain others do too as soon as he said this they should have known
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are we at a point in the lifespan of the internet where good trolling becomes an art form to appreciate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i went through a few pages of his comment history and that shit was copypasted a lot and thats just in the last two days also he mainly posts edgy comments in the default subs this dude has made like comments in the last hours so you know hes committed to trolling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im american and i remember learning the days of the week in preschool or whenever as sundaysaturday but in the real world i think most people start with monday because thats when the work week starts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats how it appears on the calendar sunday is the first day on the line sun sat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where are you from and what do yall consider your first day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,christianity comes from judaism and judaism has the sabbat on their last day on saturday its their resting day christians have sunday as their resting day because they moved it to the first day all christian calendars go from sun to sat other calendars do either mondaysunday or sunday saturday monday is the first workday of the week so its easy to just think that is also the first day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not just american i think so does arabians
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it might be because of the christian influence on uswestern culture edit whoops
SubredditDrama,not_removed,americans generally dont at least nowhere ive been i know for a fact that some countries like israel and the uae use friday saturday as a weekend tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kind of surprising that apparently americans feel so strong about this as to downvote everyone who thinks mondays the first day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,check the post history professional troll sure he hits the low hanging fruit and hes no but he does it well im somewhat impressed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive seen their comments linked here at least times in the past months hes bonkers at this point it feels like cheating
SubredditDrama,not_removed,skankhunt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres some sub dedicated to trolling they have a bot to track downbotes on people i bet hes a part of that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then why is sunday part of the weekend checkmate theists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right but in the uk and probably all europe but im not certain the calendar starts with monday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,australia sunday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uk and mondays considered the first day of the week
SubredditDrama,not_removed,us mondays the first day of the week i mean we refer to saturday and sunday as the weekend right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,saturday is actually the sabbath day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look at a typical american calender whats at the left hand beginning sunday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my freshmen year of college a lot of guys on my dorm floor liked to play smash there was a guy or two that got pissy when someone said god damn it which is fucking impossible to not say when youre getting grab spammed and spiked meteor smash by ness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have friends who object to goddammit more than fuck its consistent at least technically speaking theres a commandment against the former of course none of them would be stupid enough to make a big deal of it on the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,naw probably mlkkk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because the week has two ends where it starts and where it finishes like bookends for the weekdays
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have an irish calendar on my wall right next to me and it starts with sunday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but thats relatively recent before iso and its en predecessor it was common to have sunday as the first day of the week
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im in the us and everyone i know considers monday to be the start of the week calendars dont always reflect it though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sunday was the first day of the week in the uk once though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,saturday is the day in judismchrisitanity the romance languages basically translate saturday as the sabbath
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is it i would assume in christianity that it still follows sunday saturday based on the story of creation where on the seventh day god rests on what becomes shabbat saturday in the torah ive also been told that its why we call sunday and saturday the weekends its at two ends of the week
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shit it is all those years of sunday school
SubredditDrama,not_removed,grab spam right in the pussy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my gf is catholic and wont use god in a pejorative way so its funny when i heard her talking about how someone needed to eat shit because they were a fucking gosh damned motherfucker
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont get it is your avatar scooping up poop or gently setting them down in a row
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know a dude who makes the sign of the cross every time i swear with the dutch form of goddammit but hes a fine dude otherwise such a thing sounds so goddamn twee that if id read it id assume they were terirble or boring people but this guy is legit cool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh shit thats good im saving that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what calendars dont have sunday as the first day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre on a leash
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uk calendars for one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my windows calendar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im currently using a planner that starts every week on monday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,osx calendar google calendar though i guess those default to your regional preferences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my outlook
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive seen some businessoriented calendars that dont
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think christians go to church on sunday because jesus rose from the dead on a sunday not because they think sunday is the seventh day of the week
SubredditDrama,not_removed,come to think of it i have heard that said in the past i did some googling because why not and my super academic sources say that saturday as the day of rest was abolished with jesus the whole saying that christian biblical law over jewish biblical with the first day of the week being the new day to gather additionally theres apparently some stuff in the christian bible that supports gathering on the first day of the week httpwwwbiblecahsundayhtm httptruthfortheworldorgwhyworshiponsundaytract httpwwwgospelwaycomtopicsbiblechristiansabbathphp
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and friday for muslims cause everyone wants to be different
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that makes sense you wouldnt want them running away they could be accidentally adopted by a stranger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you set that up or is it automatic based on your locale choice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you in europe i dont believe in euro outlook or euro disney
SubredditDrama,not_removed,never even though to check until now so probably based on location
SubredditDrama,not_removed,worship on sundays is a tradition dating back to the early church when it would have been impossible to mistranslate any texts because the people reading them would be native speakers of greek aramaic andor hebrew httpwwwcatholiccomtractssabbathorsunday which quotes early texts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant help but think the ops obsession with randal flagg and his history of posting at thedonald are related
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a title op i really dont understand what would warrant posting the same question twice a month apart what was he hoping to gain also the stand isnt the hot zone or the andromeda straintheres more mythology to it than science captain trips is just a device used to bring about the apocalypse and the final battle between good and evil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,both of those threads are a giant dumpster fire of failure to comprehend the field of epidemiology
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i admit it every time theres a reported breakout of the more scary diseases like ebola or bird flu i start yelling its captain trips all the bad people go to vegas all the good people head to boulder im a bad person
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how did i get here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you suggesting we need to find this guy and kill him to hold off the apocalypse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,let there be lightskinned americans only
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey i used to support bernie sanders then the clinton campaign won out and things got shady in the democratic party my obsession with stephen king and stephen king characters is completely unrelated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what was he hoping to gain this looks to be a combination of two kinds of rasksciencefiction post that really annoy me type a the validate my fanfiction post the op has a cool whatif scenario like what if the worlddefining event at the start of the plot had happened differently you can either completely remake the story from almost whole cloth or just shrug and say then the plot wouldnt happen neither of those are very satisfying imo type b the betcha you cant explain this post why do all the characters sing in the sound of music why does the rock that kirk throws at the gorn bounce like its made of styrofoam the op is just determined to point out how the fictional universe is fundamentally broken and when someone does bend over backwards to pull an inuniverse answer out of their ass the op will sometimes argue against the offered explanation it feels like what theyre really looking for is because x is bad and dumb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but according to wikipedia hot zone which i havent read isnt fiction andromeda strain is actually fiction but it is fully researched it helps that the author was a scientist and doctor but i think youve hit the nail on the head in the earlier post he seems to think that having a setup like the research station in the andromeda strain would somehow have prevented captain trips from being released i cant tell if hes passiveaggressively determined to prove this idea or if he wants the two stories to be in the same universe or if he simply doesnt understand how fiction works or what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i forgot i asked the first question my life has been very difficult over the past month and it feels like its been a lot longer than that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,duh just drop nukes on the sick people problem solved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i aint a scientist just a crazy person my bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all the good people head to boulder except harold that guy was an asshole
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i started reading the stand literally as the ebola outbreak started a couple years ago needless to say i freaked out a tiiiinnnyyy bit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all the good people head to boulder unless its the justin cronin universe in which case you are well and truly fed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,doesnt flagg move between worlds before hes kilt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,very dead zoney
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would prefer not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats because answer to both is its a scifi story written by a bunch of laymen who wanted to tell a specific story or its a story calm down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for the record as a mod of rasksciencefiction i have no problem with the former but the latter do try my patience
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my bad didnt mean to pick a fight or make a fuss just want you to tell me if you thiiiink you can baby can you dig your man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the hot zone isnt fiction but its highly dramatized and was the basis for the fictional outbreak but you get my pointboth are based heavily on research while the stand isnt focusing on the science at all the op doesnt seem to like the death is inevitable its divine intervention answer even though that answer seems so obvious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt much care for the andromeda strain crichtons writing never made it seem like a real threat to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,upside kills of germs even more than hand sanitizer downside turns the survivors into the super mutants from fallout
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i also liked the vx gas suggestion to immobilize people first
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i realize now that my solution probably would have wound up worse than the plague itself i fucked up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,harold was not a good people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah theres a reason why i dont read apocalyptic disease stories people start freaking out and panicking luckily real life doesnt work like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,either that or he just kind of wakes up in another world after being killed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats because answer to both is a wizard cyborg did it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wasnt trying to start anything im just a big stephen king fan and i messed up it wont happen again sorry for the inconvenience i didnt want this to become a dramatic thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the hot zone was a great book that part where the monkey keepers in virginia caught ebola reston that was a really scary whatif type situation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,somewhat sorta ot but have you read warday before streiber went off to write about aliens trying to eat him or whatever he collaborated with james kunetka to write a happens next week style accounting of the us after a nuclear attack its full of mocked up documents that are based on actual scientific facts eg what would the fallout patterns be if a strike hit this place i find it equal parts fascinating heartwarming and horrific
SubredditDrama,not_removed,downside
SubredditDrama,not_removed,super mutants were created by the fev virus thank you very much nerds out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nerve gas wouldnt work youd have to release enough nerve gas to gas the entire continental united states and then ground all planes and eradicate the passengers too then any potential ships from the us would have to be sunk on sight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,moon that spells fuck harold
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i liked him a lot he was a protagonist in a wrong kind of story where he was not a protagonist that part that stu commented on when reading his diary something along the lines of changing yourself to fit the world sucks compared to changing the world to fit you its actually what propelled every protagonist ever too bad he wasnt one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i do love that flaggs greatest power is literally dipping out of situations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unless he gets eaten by a lame character that was just introduced in the narrative and stays dead still bitter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he could be a wizard too tho dont let your dreams be dreams
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no worries
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well if youre looking for a realistic book about pandemics the stand isnt for youits more a fantasymythologycentered plot and is a bit of a character study to boot you might be interested in httpsenwikipediaorgwikithewindupgirlreception or if youre into historical accounts httpsenwikipediaorgwikiajournaloftheplagueyear is a pretty amazing read
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the summary for this sounds fascinating ill have to read it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you really want to wring his scrawny neck while screaming all your problems are in your head dammit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unless you include the stand miniseries in which case his greatest power is pulling off all that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not really a power though he just knows where the local north central positronics office is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuckin spiderbaby hey father ted i hear they have a spiderbaby
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a wizard cyborg are we in a dave arneson module
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought the stand was most fascinating before the fantasy parts started getting heavy then it ended with a literal deus ex machina but king doesnt always deliver on endings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but he fixed all his problems more or less he became a nice person then he was seduced by that crazy but remained a nice person but was only this close to realizing that the devil actually has no use of him hence the oil slick
SubredditDrama,not_removed,flagg can even get out of a fashion disaster
SubredditDrama,not_removed,even though i watched the miniseries when it was on tv for whatever reason i always remember flagg as being played by even worse when i went back years later to read the book again i couldnt stop imagining him as billy ray cyrus edit omg i looked up the man who actually did play flagg jamey sheridan and virile fairhaired setjawed actor jamey sheridan was born in and raised in pasadena california
SubredditDrama,not_removed,great interpretation of randall flagg or greatest interpretation of randall flagg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he looks like tommy wiseau in this outfit in the graphic novel clearly thats his best interpretation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was pissed when i saw that matthew mcconaughey wasnt rocking a mullet in the dark tower movies i thought the mullet was canon damn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know king was in a rush to finish the series but i just cant imagine his thought process when he decided to kill one of his most memorable and enduring villains with a character who had just been introduced in the last book and would go on to serve no narrative function whatsoever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rarely does to be honest now im wondering what were kings good endings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nice people dont put bombs in closets ok
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the man in denim fled across the desert and the fashion popo followed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ahahahaha i cant stop picturing billy ray cyrus as king rolands magician in the eyes of the dragon never gonna read it again thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just rewatched it with commentary and it wasnt until this last week that i realized that randall flagg is the boss cop on law order ci it weirds me out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes although honestly if he showed up looking like hed probably win because thats not remotely threatening to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,havent read it and now im sort of scared to look last thing i need is forever reading flaggs dialogue in johnnys voice youre tearing me apart roland
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hah idris elba as roland fantastic but mcconaugheys hair pfft
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was poorly thought out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i liked the end of the running man book not movie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he was sixteen teenagers go crazy for pussy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the denim was the source of his power when he changed clothes he lost his power and became vulnerable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how is the commentary its one ive always meant to check out he also played olivers dad on arrow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i went to my parents place for a visit several years ago and my mother was watching one of those wonderfully horrible lifetime movies and he played the evil neighbor who was secretly videotaping little girls changing into swimsuits to swim in his pool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we mahst haff pahlahver mark i hear you mahke commala with lisa my future wife
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anyway how is your sex life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that may get confusing for the audience when he gets to the parts with odettadetta
SubredditDrama,not_removed,craving for poon doesnt excuse putting bombs in a closet and killing people ok
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the first hour is great i fell asleep though as i was intending its a lot to process
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess the weird thing for me is that i recognized the actor in all his modern roles but never connected him to randall flagg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unless we cast betty white as a miserable old racist southern belle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dunno man she sounded pretty kinky
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nice gonna toss it on the pile of things to listen to while playing a game thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,edit jesus christ youre dense we might as well just ban all sources of news since we can just read the placemat sean spicer wrote on in crayon fantastic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is a juicy one because the actual news anchors at fox are calling out trump as well bret baier shep smith pretty much every journalist is uncool with restricting press credentials
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like im listening to someone play magic the gathering when people only argue by pointing out fallacies i deflect your false equivalency with my fallacy fallacy people know theres a way to debate which includes talking about the actual topic right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love how culling subreddits of homophobic slurs is an attack on muh free speech but apparently preventing media organizations from attending normal press related events is not at all in any way censorship lovely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyve moved from calling it the msm to just msm and now im even more confused mainstream isnt even two words it should be mm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont get people who dont understand that the bbc and ap are very neutral political news organizations anyone who thinks bbc is biased but who then thinks brietbart isnt has failed a basic intelligence test of some kind they only way you could explain that would be a lack of any brain tissue entirely stuff like this were through the looking glass here people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man what a shitshow does trump really believe the large majority of the msm should fuck off to california along with millions of illegal voters just because he sees dissenting opinions as personal attacks on himself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the hypocrisy is so overpowering here its almost hilarious if it wasnt super painful it seems people will defend anything this man does
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like trump just wanted a safe space™
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tbh whats more depressing than reading that news is reading the notcompletelyidiotic trump supporters comments its pretty clear theyve been brainwashed by the altright and it just pains me to think that if they were in a different environment they wouldnt be so hatefilled and mindlessly following this selfdestructive agenda
SubredditDrama,not_removed,more gold going down in rpolitics than in a boxing promoters teeth politics is causing people to get gold happy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this seems like kind of a big deal no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have no responsibility to answer your question when framed in such a way it is actually irresponsible for me to do so since that kind of action derails debate you refute a claim with evidence before making another this is my new goto line for everything edit and i can fit just enough of it into a flair
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hitler took the guns other than disarming jews hitler loosened gun control
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i want to enjoy this popcorn so much but the real world implications are making the popcorn bowl lined with piss
SubredditDrama,not_removed,guys what the fuck is a leftist ive seen this word more often lately and it irks me edit thank you for answering my question
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but td was filtered out of rpopular checkmate libs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they should do this on snl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,itd be funny if it wasnt so sad i have to say if i was the potus i wouldnt be trying to antagonize as many news outlets as possible thats a pissing match you dont want to start well unless youre trump anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i dont see how any person or party would be okay restricting press like this even trump supporters the man has to step down eventually and if he sets the precedent of restricting press like this what is there to stop a future president from doing the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,meanwhile hannity still has trumps cock balls deep down his throat granted he gets an exception since hes not a journalist in any sense of the word
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tbh shep smith has been calling gopers out for the ridiculousness for years its not exactly new behavior for him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i roll my eyes every time someone brings up a fallacy and doesnt actually address the context of the argument its so watered down anymore i just assume anyone who brings one up just learned about them the day before and spent all night learning about them on wikipedia just because someone commits a fallacy doesnt mean they dont have a point in there if all youve done is point out a fallacy you may as well have not commented at all and been more productive in the conversation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the problem is that trump is playing magic the gathering while everyone else is playing canasta
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was thinking about that in regards to the recent blowups with milo and pewdiepie theres this vocal group that is bleating free speech for them but seem to be ignorant of the moves their often beloved president sex criminal does which are much more curtailing of free speech then getting pdp less money for entertaining tweens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its because free speech isnt a principle to them its a political tool to bait liberals into giving their message a platform they dont care about free speech for all they care about free speech for themselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you see the bad kind of censorship is when nazis get censored censoring everybody who doesnt conform with the nazi narrative is the good kind of censorship
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you want a genuine answer i will do my best free speech has come to mean two very different things its classical meaning is freedom of speech from the government preventing the government from shutting down what you say the more modern sense has to do with the idea of freedom of speech and a more libertarian worldview and the idea is simple speech is important if we shutter all speech we are fearful of oppose it being said then we greatly inhibit progress with the increasing power of the internet and corporations this is very dangerous as for youre censorship its very simple it isnt censorship they can still say what they like their show wasnt taken off from the tv their offices didnt get raided they wherent invited to a press events due to their recent coverage of trump the point of a press event isnt for the press its for the people its so that joe average can get a better sense of the world the media gets news joe average gets informed the whitehouse informs people winwinwin when you have stations actively lying and with heavily biased coverage ignoring positives and literally suggesting the president has hookers pissed on a bed and that he might be some russian spy then the whole point of press events are void if the white house cant effectively communicate with the people even with criticism then why host those who are just looking for the next attack
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont you bring majoras mask into this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the msm the mainstream media msm medical speak for men who have sex with men
SubredditDrama,not_removed,themedia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well at least weve moved past lamestream media
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its because their grasp of the english language is so poor that they think mainstream is two words
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the minion masters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,subreddit drama srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is an odd criticism from someone who im willing to wager is familiar with dna and cpr i get your point just a weird thing to make fun of since acronyms which have two letters covering a single word especially at a point where the compound part of the word comes up are very common i guess were all dolts then or shall we push the science and healthcare industries to change the abbreviations for concern of confusing people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everyone is biased depending on your point of view its just not possible to present a completely objective perspective on any given event that said its far preferable to have media organisations that at least make the attempt to be as objective as they can but even then there will be all sorts of bias in terms of what issues they choose to focus on and which stories will be of most interest to their readers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bbc doesnt indulge tea partytrump canards and talking points therefore it can never be viewed as neutral in america
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some guy replied to me with something along the lines of the bbc is a foreign government led news agency hence propaganda by default ¯°o¯
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at times i can definetly see the bbc as not being neutral but to think that theyre anywhere near as bard as breitbart is fucking insane even a worst case characterisation of the bbcs bias is leagues below bretbart
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who then thinks brietbart isnt i actually dont think ive observed anyone suggesting breitbart is unbiased everyone i know who checks them out are aware they lean right pretty hard the issue is more that they arent aware of how far right they are and maybe trust too many of the suggestedencouraged views and opinions presented in a headlinearticle point being that just because someone may get their news from breitbart it doesnt mean they think its unbiased its just that they trust them for some reason id like to think most people are aware of the sources they consume are likely biased one way hello huffpo salon slate etc i wouldnt say not to read them entirely but rather to be able to recognize that they have a bias towards news you may like to hear which is no different than people on the right with breitbart as far as this particular subject is concerned i see a lot of people on the left and right being pretty much the same people in regards to clinging to news theyd rather listen to just because the flag you wave is a different color doesnt mean you dont have the same thought processes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,california is a state that doesnt know how to do business either the fact that its economy is larger than that of russia obviously that is just a crazy liberal lie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a cult at this point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why wouldnt they they support him not whatever positions he happened to espouse during the campaign
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a literal gilded age
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao thats the ultimate conceding copypasta
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a term mostly used by rightleaning people to refer to leftleaning people or organizations ive seen some people use it in a relatively neutral way but most of the time its more or less an insult or method of demonizationist is a classic way of making an ideology sound dogmatic and scary eg fascist or communist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a person who believes in leftwing politics in the us the closest thing in mainstream politics is the leftwing democrats hillary was pretty solidly a centrist with left leanings bernie was a moderate leftist extreme leftists splinter into a hundred different factions with a lot of divergent philosophies eg anarchists marxistleninists syndicalists that im not really qualified to expand on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they already have him illustrating his words with toys and dolls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you do if youre trump it goes part and parcel with the authoritarian strongman shtick rob ford was at war with the toronto star for his entire time in office and now that hes dead its difficult to say who won because his base still loves him no matter what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump gave a speech thats available on youtube i dont know the name sorry where he says his way in life is to destroy anyone who speaks poorly of him so no one will ever dare to do so again this has been him since the beginning hes a narcissist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its about discrediting freedom of speech
SubredditDrama,not_removed,go have a look at the donald thread about this theyre celebrating this as a huge win against fake news
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i get the feeling that a strong sense of foresight isnt particularly common in trump supporters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you kidding trumps rallies used to sell shirts literally advocating lynching the press fascists celebrate this kind of thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump supporters hate liberals more than they love their country i would apply that statement to a lot of republicans at this point but trump supporters especially here very clearly dont give a fuck about pretending otherwise you dont get this shit received positively if you love your country welcome to the fucking nightmare world we live in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what is there to stop a future president from doing the same your mistake is thinking that trumphis supporters approve of bipartisan system andor believe that sane republicans will be ever in charge again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,totally the erosion of democratic institutions can come back to bite them in the ass what if the next president is democratic and pulls this shit theyd be boiling with fury and theyd be right to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wouldnt give them too much credit the presss anger with trump is largely selfserving in that they want to maintain the symbiotic relationship of being the publics access to the president even nonfox outlets arent terribly upset with the muslim ban or seriously increased deportation theyre upset because theyre either being called liars or being shut out completely sure theyll put out stories but they only really push back against trump with his fake news stuff fundamental rights of others are not as important to them as their own statusquo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why he is not restricting the press from writing whatever they want the presidentpress secretary is not under any obligation to let random people into histheir briefing room
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im kind of surprised at this point that people are still surprised when shep does something like this hes a competent journalist who has been calling it like it is for probably decades by now hes on fox news but he has never been a stereotypical fox news journalist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for real fallacies mean nothing outside of internet arguments or logic class why when arguing would one use a rhetorical device that isnt common knowledge other than to appear smart through the use of technical jargon good rule of thumb dont say the fallacy name explain why in context a particular argument is invalid because of the fallacy eg dont say strawman explain that the stance is not one youve taken and is not pertinent to the argument at hand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre basically larping
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wish centerleft liberal voters would realize this the farright doesnt care about debating ideas they have their ideas theyre not going to be moved by reason its like playing chess with a pigeon both are just going to shit all over everything yeah debate and free speech are important but there are also people who just wont be convinced and will use the gifts of liberal society against it to plunge everyone into tyranny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt because i have heard every excuse in the book but thanks anyways i understand why people dont see the hypocrisy a literal government entity is trying to shutter prominent news outletsyes it is by not giving them dataa platform not by literal barring of publication but people telling you to eff off on reddit are also only shuttering you in so much as not giving you a platform it is censorship just not the illegal kind when i censor myself in front of kids i dont use that word because the police are going to drag me away for swearing i use it because thats what the word censor is for the point of a press event isnt for the press please do tell me how you can call it a press event and say it is not for the press the accurate statement is to say that it is not for the benefit of the press but a vehicle for the press to do their jobs when you have stations actively lying and with heavily biased coverage ignoring positives and literally suggesting the president has hookers pissed on a bed and that he might be some russian spy then the whole point of press events are void tell me how a president thats deciding their own news coverage by censoring the places he doesnt like is giving less biased news tell me how speech is important if we shutter all speech we are fearful of oppose it being said then we greatly inhibit progress doesnt apply to the president of the united states
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youve met with a terrible fate havent you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres a guy in that thread who says msm are disgusting and i honestly dont know if hes talking about cnn or just having a homophobic rant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what i see every time too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sortof a step up from lugenpresse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right wing meme technology has advanced at terrifying speeds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but ive never seen srd used to refer to anything else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im confused because i usually see msm used to mean men who have sex with men
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everyone is biased but some try and combat their bias which is why i used the term very neutral and not perfectly neutral the bbc ap npr and a few others are all as close as you can humanly get without cyborg implants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these are the same people who will read russia today and think its totally unbiased
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus you would think these people would pay attention to british politics and one of the complaints of the torys is that the bbc always is against them and one of the complaints by labour is that the bbc makes jeremy corbyn look stupid by reporting what he says and does they do some stupid stuff occasionally the time they issued their condemnation of frankie boyle was pretty funny in and of itself but then i remember the super bowl nipple incident and people lose their minds everywhere over very minor stuff at times fox news or more propaganda than is the bbc and i would really class fox news as propaganda either sometimes i might when i am angry or stupid but not after i calm down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most of the bbs bias shows up in things other than their news though like when they condemned frankie boyle for basically being frankie boyle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i read some weird left wing web sites myself i regular visit raw story but im under no delusions they sometimes are actually raving lunatics of the left i also read the nation which is also extremely left wing in nature but they are something different from raw story on an intellectual scale to say the least salon and huffington post some in somewhere between raw story and the nation on that same intellectual scale if somebody wants a good right wing view with their news then they can read the wall street journal andor the national review but breitbart is a lot like raw story and there is no real high intellectual level content there and if obama had picked the raw story topguy to be his white house advisor i would have said obama was a raving crazy for that as well i really wish the right was reading national review if trump had made rich lowry a senior advisor i would have disagreed with him on almost everything but i wouldnt deny the guy was wicked intelligent but breitbart and steve bannon are not intellectuals at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bloody splitters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huge placard on the northbound side of between sheppard and finch proudly remembering the guy feels weird man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rob ford is dead what the fuck i had no idea and apparently hes been dead for a year jesus christ how did i not hear about this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,his opposition mustve been quite weak up to this point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah they just know that its fine when their side does it but unamerican if the other side does it because jesus or the constitution or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that should absolutely happen turnabout is fair play both sides will take turns pushing things further and further while the opposition party gets angrier and angrier
SubredditDrama,not_removed,even nonfox outlets arent terribly upset with the muslim ban or seriously increased deportation most outlets are reporting on other people being upset about these eos because they want to maintain their neutrality ie not openly care about anything at all you wont see lester holt on nbc news or a front page washington post article directly slamming these policies theyll cover protests and get interviews from relevant people go to wapo editorials and youll see plenty of pushback to these policies fundamental rights of others are not as important to them as their own statusquo this isnt really fair i think i would say they absolutely do care about this but theyre not going to report on these events with really strong value judgement statements since they are trying to be news outlets not pundits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these arent random people they are journalists and press organizations and trump is restricting their access to the white house my point entirely was lets say in years time or years time etc etc we dont have a republican president which im assuming you are a republican and we have a democrat as a president would you be okay with a democrat president preventing plenty of news organizations from attending press briefings trump prevented cnn but allowed in fox news lets say the democrat brings in cnn but bans fox it basically becomes an arms race at this point where the president decides to let in his media that are favourites to himher and not let anyone else in trump just started that trend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if it matches his tie he may have to be a snake person to make that work
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if nothing else that would at least show everyone if youve understood the fallacy youre trying to coopt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we have to go back to stop the election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but thats only because i played dd back in the day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks to this altright bullshit my craigslist ads have taken on an entirely new meaning that i am not pleased with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i for one welcome our eventual cyborg overlords
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have no idea why npr developed the reputation of being liberal they literally just tell you the information and make a few comments on it people act like its the lefts limbaugh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im fairly sure theres a gulf of difference between rt and bbc im sure that bbc tends to promote the current governments agenda to some extent but its nothing like the blatant propaganda mouthpiece for putin that is rt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the bbc definitely has an anglocentric and at times proestablishment bias but its not a willing tool of the government the way rt is of the kremlin its an independent organisation that generally speaking does a fairly good job at remaining neutral
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and if obama had picked the raw story topguy to be his white house advisor i would have said obama was a raving crazy for that as well totally if obama has buzzfeed and dailykos in there instead of trumpbreitbart i would think that is fucking crazy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh yeah i think bannon being anywhere near trump is so damn bizarre i just think that for better or worse people cling to their favorite sites fully aware of their biases regardless of magnitude and that frame of thought doesnt belong to any political ideology id like to give most people the benefit of the doubt that they know the slants of their favorite sources right and left you see news outlets prioritizing what opinion you should have usually in the headline over providing the details and letting you think for yourself its just been a frustrating environment when it comes to dissecting our media options maybe its been this bad for longer than i realize and i just paid far more attention the last two years cynicism is hard to shake here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,apparently when your drug habit is so bad that reporters give up and just act like cracksmoking mayor rob ford is your full name it doesnt do wonders for your health
SubredditDrama,not_removed,another commenter described it as an arms race theyre absolutely right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,would you be okay with a democrat president preventing plenty of news organizations from attending press briefings trump prevented cnn but allowed in fox news lets say the democrat brings in cnn but bans fox it basically becomes an arms race at this point where the president decides to let in his media that are favourites to himher and not let anyone else in thats the point this should concern everyone its a bipartisan issue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes absolutely future presidents can invite or disinvite whatever press organizations they want from their press conferences it has nothing to do with the first amendment does it mean the white house is being less open sure but think of it this way the president is not required to hold these daily briefings at all there is no free speech issue unless the press is actually being blocked from writing what they want like happens in china the press is not being restricted as you claimed and it is no kind of ground to call for trump to step down as you did that is my point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the right wing kept repeating the lie for decades so now its accepted as the commonly accepted wisdom like all that baggage hillary clinton was carrying why the left wing progressives have allowed the republican right to do this for decade after decade and never respond in kind i dont know the left just likes to rollupinaball occasionally and scream please dont hurt me rather than actually fighting back then they get bill clinton elected in and then never show up for the midterms or get obama elected in and then dont show for the midterms then they sit around and complain with obama didnt keep all his promises so thats why i didnt help in where as if they had helped in they would have seen obama keep more of his promises now they are going to see trump keep a lot of his crazy promises and then wonder why they were accidentally deported or something equally scary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it wasnt even the drugs that did him in but cancer though the drugs probably didnt help
SubredditDrama,not_removed,drugs dont kill people cancer kills people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you werent being facetious youd get along well with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no im pretty sure that guy gets along well with nobody
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no wonder people think they need sarcasm tags around here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know if theres a reddit version of this term but on twitter we would call this guys downward spiral trying to tweet through it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the title should of been from left field user in rbaseball just trying to knock the mariners fans down a peg in thread involving marlins and cardinals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that guy is the worst kind of sports fan talks a lot of shit while not knowing half a much as he claims to then once you get him backed into a corner he switched to another sport so you have to start over again i love how he claims seattle has no good wrs when we had a receiver who was tied for most touchdowns last season

SubredditDrama,not_removed,this sub has turned into a weekly battleground for liberals and altrighters to throw starpacks back and fourth at each other op has taken a break from thedonald to support his teams presence on the sub keep it up everyone great stuff hes not wrong im on that sub a lot and every day there will be a new starter pack that alternates between shitting on the left and shitting on the right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why does it only have to be the altright true conservative principles like smaller government lower taxes and personal responsibility deserve no thought they mention those principles a lot but they dont seem to govern according to them strange that and many paleoconservatives hate trump and collusion with the russians notallconservatives
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao the op of that thread runs a sub called rsociopathrevenge
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man so many comments which a trump supporters actually gets cornered ends in why you so angry that you lost the election lol if you cant defend his points or your own for a fact maybe its time to reconsider your position edit and this is why trump won just to shut down conversations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i gave up when i saw people starting to defend infowars as news theyre just trying to silence alexs voice please please please god dont let normalising alex jones become a popular view point like i can deal with talking about trump and his policies on immigration censorship terrorism etc i disagree with many of them but i can listen and discuss with people but if there comes a point where people try to tell me its all about the chemicals obama released to turn the frogs gay or we need to prevent an attack from the plane of existence and other people agree and say lets just hear him out i will end my life then and there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i bet you call them esports i think i finally found my flair
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this was the first piece of comedy from the right that was actually funny i applaud op for that one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reeeeeeeeeeepublicans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you larping must be or just retarded i see the larp callout game has finally reached reddit and still yet no one has taken a moment to realize that this is the internet and nothing is liveaction
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the real clickbait are the comments you are responding to whining about politics buzzfeed and salon clickbait n a popular website or web activity that i dont like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can we just talk about how low quality rstarterpacks is on every level
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just the fact that libs were insulted proves just how on the nose this hit piece really was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its definitely lost something from common innocuous stereotypes of people you see walking around but it was probably going to devolve into shit slinging sooner or later as people on both sides upvote political internet stereotypes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and all the obvious starter packs have been done to death so whats left is niche content and people passive aggressively shitting on someone who upset them that day a la lifeprotips
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actually im not an altrighter just a regular righter response to that gold material right there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i say this a lot but i dont feel like true conservatives really have a party to call home in the us anymore republicans certainly dont abide by old school conservative principles and obviously the dems dont either
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey welcome to my sub this is like rprorevenge but for sociopaths hahahahaha without fail every single person who refers to themselves as a sociopath is just a maladjusted moron
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not an alex jones fan but i do enjoy listening to paul joseph watson
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think i remember a time when starter packs werent used by people to shit on people different than them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,old man with a parrot starter pack is a celebration of style
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what difference am i not grasping freedom and liberty are generally western values not limited to america maybe to some extent but this free market bullshit is not western values neither is constitutionally protected free speech or the idea that a business should be free to discriminate to their pleasure a lot of people from all countries tend to make the mistake that their countries values are the default values of all similar countries

SubredditDrama,not_removed,daily reminder to never visit college subreddits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if aggressive feminists arrived at mra events denying people entry etc i wonder if that poster knows this actually happens pretty frequently would it be surprising if these events became open to men only yeah it would be surprising this generally doesnt happen if it did the protests would only intensify
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes its sexist but a hostile environment for men seriously i mean come on if theres any industry men arent underrepresented in its computing

SubredditDrama,not_removed,its been a while since i visited the sub is the wpirg drama still on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont grandstand keep this is subreddits like circlebroke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no thats done with since the referendum ended in september i think there was a couple smug posts in early october but wpirg is a pretty shit organization so even if i didnt like how ruwaterloo was attacking wpirg i dont really care that they lost their funding this is an organization that campaigned under keepwpirg and then after the referendum went oops just kidding the referendum wasnt actually about that fancy that were still gonna be around
SubredditDrama,not_removed,y do u even care this thread was removed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this comment is better served in circlebroke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i followed the wpirg drama in the beginning and came to pretty much the same conclusion as you about the organization even though it doesnt really affect me as a grad student but i feel like the constant circlejerk against it was what caused the subreddit to go to shit that and the feridun memes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so you know going forward thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fair enough removed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lots of mental gymnastics trying to defend these peoples actions its okay to say that people you agree with politically behaved poorly and shouldnt have bullied the lady
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there sure were a lot of new users who usually dont post in rrage in that thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wont lie im going to miss all the content the election has provided us
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same thing going on in the rpublicfreakout comments as well if anyones interested to take a look
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just a week and a half to go and then maybe all of this crazy will die down ill just keep telling myself that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you have proof from a reputable source its from the okeefe undercover video series i believe its part two apparently americans united for change superpac which is illegally controlled by the clinton campaign admitted on hidden camera that they pay people trained fighters homeless people the mentally unstable to go start shit outside trump rallies but to make it look organic the woman with the oxygen tank who claimed she was attacked by a trump supporter was revealed to be a paid agitator and the group also claimed credit for the chicago shut down of the trump rally that turned into a violent riot as well as the arizona freeway shut down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the mental gymnastics to take an okeefe video at face value while ignoring the access hollywood tape is astounding
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt matter which side its for if it becomes apparent that you can win an election through violence and intimidation violence and intimidation will replace the election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is a reason speech is protected we recognize that even a difference of opinion even to the point of terrible speech violence isnt okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the weak must fear the strong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is this whole election campaign the biggest pile of horrible shit in political history or what every which way you turn theres new bile and vitriol from candidates or their fucking supporters or detractors america whoever wins its not going to be pleasant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you know this subreddit is acting all high and mighty but i remember being downvoted to hell for saying dont physically attack people for having opinions you dont like when it came to someone assaulting a neonazi not too long ago consistency would be nice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the video is gone now so maybe someone can answer did it actually seem real because that thumbnail looks super posed im wondering if its another one of these
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i do agree with trump supporters that this is clearly on the list reprehensible violence however their list of acceptable and noble violence makes things complicated if this was the poor mother of someone vaguely suspected of terrorism and she was pelted with hellfire missiles instead of punches and pushes theyd be cheering with patriotic glee it doesnt mean they deserve mob violence its just that their noble high horse is quite a stunted shortlegged pony
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wouldnt put it past them if it was scripted but yeah shame everywhere
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not yet we only attack trump supporters after the election ive already got my sock full of sand tied up and ready for beating innocents
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right im voting for hillary but this video is awful and the people ripping up her signs and yelling at her should not be defended by liberals im also unimpressed by people going but but but trump supporters do it too great and when they do theyre wrong too how about instead of trying to defend it or distract from it we just acknowledge that it was fucking wrong where are all of the fucking adults this election cycle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean to be fair at least theyre generally being downvoted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i saw it in rpublicfreakout and that sub skews young and very edgy so a lot of trump support i dont think ive seen a single person defend the actions of these people but i see countless people say this is an example of why you should vote trump that doesnt make any sense whatsoever though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my absolute favorite part was when they twice said that trump supporters commit much more violence that we dont hear about because the right doesnt call out their own like the left does
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah not sure how its remotely justifiable that being said i feel like this is news precisely because its unusual would anyone be surprised if it was trump supporters attacking a hillary supporter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nope we live in the era of cultural marxism where individuality is wrong and criticizing an individual is equated to demonizing the entire demographic that would include them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you implying people are messing with the buttery popcorn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this video is in other subs so youre gonna get crosspollination
SubredditDrama,not_removed,would you say they are trying to correct some type of record
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont worry the cloud of fear and disappointment will linger for years to come
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really i was ready for this shit to be over months ago internet slap fights are great but when it gets into the real world its not so fun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well trump certainly isnt going to admit that he lost so that should be plenty of content for years to come
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no matter who wins enough popcorn will be provided for at least years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just you wait till presuming were still have public elections by then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nothing says i am enlightened and not racisthateful like bullying people who disagree with you wasnt expecting this kind of sanity in publicfreakout of all places
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no this is just the beginning
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uh a little outoftheloop here what do you mean by okeefe video and hollywood tape sorry just a little confused
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah this is just so fucking perfect its hard to believe trump supporting homeless woman sounds like a wet dream to come true to be beaten down the election may be ugly but i doubt this ugly its just too perfect just needs the mother end a child getting beaten up or an elder veteran
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wash away the anger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,way to spin it nice deflection
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah you see all that shit costs money and more importantly that aint in our wheelhouse you think i cheer when we level a hospital or when i read that we have a full of drone strikes injuring civilians what the fuck is wrong with you america first thats what were about once weve been taken care of maybe well go take a look into policing the planet again but until that point fuck off out of here with that bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they voted for the wrong candidate they are not innocent s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a batterybased stuffing would better befit the crime youd be committing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,me too snappy me too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sometimes i cant actually comprehend how people get from a to b i dont know how to digest how silly this is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,brogressives defending a homeless woman who is being attacked because of who shes voting for very bro
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree that its shitty but its not unprecedented in american political history i mean andrew jackson publicly fantasized about murdering his political opponents and lbj implied on at least one occasion that gerald ford was brain damaged barry goldwater and his radical supporters also accused their opponents of communism at the drop of a hat i think the big difference is that because of social media information technologies etc its constantly in your face and that has a tendency to radicalize people thus when a candidate like trump starts to really scare large numbers of people it kicks off a kind of chain reaction of radicalism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,obviously three election cycles arent conclusive of a longterm pattern but im old enough to see a clear escalation of impassioned voters acting maliciously starting with obamas election reelection and this one it makes me nervous regardless of taking a side if the peaceful exchange of power is questionable our democracy is at risk that scares me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but acknowledging that its wrong damages the narrative that politicians and their campaigns want to feed you if its the opposition its heinous evil and representative of that ideology if its from the same party affiliation then its a fringe group that doesnt actually represent the party politics is mental gymnastics in the form of manipulation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im voting for hillary this is reddit its all hillary supporters here minus a few trump trolls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are adults this election cycle none voting none running edit huh didnt think anyone with half a brain could give such a damn about literally the worst election in american history
SubredditDrama,not_removed,true true
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they definitely deserve to be unfortunately the trump supporters are grabbing onto that and acting all holier than thou over it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you imply young voters are backing trump when polling suggests young voters back hillary at simialr percentages as obama won the young vote there isnt more trump support in the young that hillary support just the internet seems that way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and im sure your opinion on the matter is completely unbiased right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this type of argument is so dumb i see it all over the internet and its really only one step above yelling look over there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know youre being facetious but this resembles what i like to call trump ethics another example trump is informed that he was bragging about committing what amounts to sexual assault and battery ⟶ it should be overlooked because people out there are literally cutting other peoples heads off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see this on both sides of the coin trump supporters who respond to any criticism of trump with but what about emails hillary supporters who respond to any criticism of hillary with well at least she doesnt brag about raperefuse to cede election resultsinsert trump scandal here its stupid if youre going to vote for a candidate it really ought to be one you can support without comparing them to someone else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the altleft is just as violent reactionary and hate fuelled as the altright
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that being said i feel like this is news precisely because its unusual by that do you mean that the leftwing in us politics is the nonviolent and accepting group and their opponents are closeminded racists who shut down any attempt to express views which do not conform to theirs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i actually would be yeah all of the violence that ive seen from trump supporters has been directed at people protesting during trump rallies i havent seen any times when trump supporters have attacked clinton supporters out in the community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would because i would see it on the news first this is horrid behavior but it wont get reported on due to which side was the aggressor sucks i only found the video trough reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its only unusual if you havent been paying attention trump supporters have at rallies before this now heres where you say but that was an isolated incident too and i get to link ten more that you were unaware of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we live in the era of cultural marxism jlawokaygif
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i find it funny when this sub acts so smug and superior but when politics pops up everyone starts pissing in the popcorn fuck now im acting smug
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think theyre saying that there people touching the popcorn like usual not everything is a ctr conspiracy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,true and this election is the first in my lifetime where it really seems to be spilling out into the real world beyond simple arguments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes got his loyal fan base for his more fairer and more unbaised than fox news network so well certainly not lose this font of drama for quite some time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my bets that he will never truly concede losing a fair election he might concede superficially but its outside of his nature—one of unbridled egoism vanity and fragility—to genuinely accept responsibility without deflecting blame onto every other thing under the sun i honestly think this will become the threshold at which at least for me his behavior will lose any comedic value itll simply be reinforcing a personality disorder that he seems to have no insight into after his personality is no longer as immediate a threat to national security
SubredditDrama,not_removed,publicfreakout of all places were not that bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if ever theres a time to treat something superstitiously or as a selffulfilling prophecy i think its now lets not keep telling ourselves this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,james okeefe is a professional rightwing propagandist he goes around films videos with liberals then edits them to make it look like liberals are doing something bad his videos created the acorn scandal and this election season he released a video that supposedly showed clinton campaign officials inciting violence of course hes known to edit his videos to twist other peoples words into something that he wants them to say the hollywood access video is where grab them by the pussy came from
SubredditDrama,not_removed,would work
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for a second i thought you were serious does more poorly reflect on me for being gullible or the general discourse around here for being extreme
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not spinning anything im questioning whether your condemnation of violence is consistent or selective
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god bless america and no place else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nothing says defending america like bombing innocent civilians who present no threat to us whatsoever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am utterly shocked any of you people come here to argue your politics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,america first thats what were about as a wishywashy quasiisolationist catchphrase sure as a serious description of a cultural and political movementi think not far from it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you think i cheer when we level a hospital or when i read that we have a full of drone strikes injuring civilians i dont know you i do know trump is pro drone murdering civilians as per his own words
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah an orange would be most appropriate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i didnt know that about any of the previous elections thanks for the info i agree that technology probably exacerbates the problem its kind of like the problem with crime and letting your kids run around the neighborhood and be kids when i was a kid it twerent no thing to ride my bike miles to my best friends house as long as i was home for dinner now im scared to let my kids go to the park at the end of our street by themselves not because i think theyll get murdered but because im scared some busybody will call cps on me for letting them out of my sight because the world has changed since i was a kid damn straight it has the violent crime rate peaked in when i was and running amok and has been going down since then but people have access to so much more bad news from the internet and social media they think that the world is much less safe than it used to be thanks for reminding me that this is true of elections as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean andrew jackson publicly fantasized about murdering his political opponent and we had a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaaronburr who did more than just fantasize about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a fellow old i agree my first election was bushgore and even in the bushkerry election when bush had become sort of universally reviled by a lot of people on the left i dont recall the sort of malice that we saw with the obama elections and even then nothing like what we are seeing this cycle i dont honestly expect that there will be rioting in the streets after this election but we are not headed down a good path i am hopeful ever the optimist that after this election cycle we all take a good hard look at ourselves and how polarized weve allowed ourselves to become it seems like these days people think that those who disagree with them politically arent just people who have differing ideas about what would be best for the country but are literally the enemy my dad is currently not speaking to me because he knows im voting for hillary which should come as no surprise weve had different political views since i was a teenager im now so hes had about years to come to terms with the fact that im a libtard but apparently it never gets easier anyway im waiting for enough people to say enough is enough our fellow americans arent the enemy we just disagree ive known so many people who have actually lost friends or had family members stop speaking to them like my dad over this stupid election some weird part of me is actually hopeful that its gotten bad enough and enough people have been hurt by it that well actually say this is awful and dumb and were not going to tolerate this kind of divisive bullshit anymore but thats me the year old pollyanna
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i honestly fear that we will see some sort of a civil war in the united states a decade from now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,blame the right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,say what of all the crimes that people had accused hilary of being childish is the one thing that is very clearly not true shes an experienced politician she knows how to act the act shes absolutely professional and mature on tv and on stage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup they think people downvote them because they disagree when in reality its because their opinion is just blatantly factually wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not what im implying but on rthedonald and more edgy subreddits like publicfreakout your trump supporters are going to heavily skew to younger people yeah exactly the internet just seems that way and a few subs in particular there are some conservative subs i dont think skew so overwhelmingly young as the two i just mentioned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nope not at all hypocrisy is halarious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its called tu quoque its meant to suggest someone is committing the same act they are condemning which is only one step above and you are hanging blacks which is when you accuse someone of a totally irrelevant act to discredit them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,altleft no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kropotkin did nothing wrong edit surprised to see that apparently i was the only one who thought it was a joke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the altleft not a thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think you mean regressive left bruh that seems to be the term du jour these days for leftists that you disagree with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i agree that its unusual that something as supposedly rare as this didnt make any major news report
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while true you also hear stories about trump supporters just attacking brown people in the streets
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unironically repeating propaganda from a known liar wew lad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i find it funny when literally anything happens im easy to please
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pissing in the popcorn refers to posting comments in the linked thread its rare for srd members to do this as its often obvious and they will be banned voting in linked threads is another thing entirely though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man you can ruin a fucking joke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and itll happen no matter who wins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if trump supporters did this hillary supporters would be doing the same thing its almost like both sides are incredibly biased
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but if it was a hillary supporter getting signs torn up there wouldnt be this outrage on reddit what you think reddit is protrump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean this time its backed up by emails that including pay receipts and names and craigslist ads for actors and so on little bit of a different situation also the emails have dkim signatures ensuring authenticity but man do i hate okeefe stuff its like watching an early episode of tmz
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he got people fired not sure a fake video does that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt make you gullible you just spend too much time here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,haha keep it up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on the other hand you gotta take out their families — donald j somebodys doing the raping trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair that is pretty classic american like one of the first things we did when we got here was call everyone indian and start shooting them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,were always here be afraid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre most welcome and thats an excellent insight youre pretty cool new mom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my first election was bushgore old no were not dammit 😣
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree with most of what youre saying i think a big reason for the rancor this election cycle and the previous two as you mention is because the republican party at least in its current form has been in its death throes for the last decade or so trump is the end result of a decade demographic shift that favors the democrats the average age of a fox news viewer is and the republican core leadership just doesnt resonate with young people but its not just the republicans even the democrats faced a party crisis this year with most young people rallying behind bernie the democrats were better able to reunify after the primary mostly i think because the prospect of a trump presidency is so terrifying to them but the dems have some hard questions to ask themselves too i think once the parties are able to realign themselves with their voters things will hopefully become less awful but then again i too am an optimist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah ive seen this a lot too i worry that the level of extreme rhetoric is causing this like how if you compare news clips from a long time ago vs todays election cycles it is a lot more aggressive and fear mongering in tone like when obamas first election happened people were saying he isnt even american and hes a communist hes going to take away our guns hes going to be a dictator and a bunch of people around here were legit scared like that level of paranoia and fear is not common in us elections of the past its like the culture around politics is just a mess we didnt intend to cause but here we are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it will only get worse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it started when republicans went batshit at clinton democrats reacted by hating bush and republicans doubled down on hating obama and here we are with democrats saying the republican candidate is the end of the party and republicans saying the democratic candidate should be in prison
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my first election was reaganmondale this nonsense started during the proliferation of misinformation via social media is how people get whipped into a frenzy its lots and lots of chicken little and crying wolf at the same time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yknow that idea has come to me more than once in the past year or so i sincerely hope we are both very fucking wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how about both sides take accountability for the shitshow this whole election cycle has become were all being fucking assholes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,blame the people that arent the ones causing violence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they think people downvote because theyre ctr shills
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as opposed to non facite quod faciebam facio et faciamor the trumppence campaign strategy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i agree with that i didnt put it very clearly in my comment but what i mean is that you shouldnt compare your candidate to others as a way to excuse their actions or shortcomings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,link one of them i would be interested in seeing it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had always assumed that pissing in the popcorn referred to both
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a skill
SubredditDrama,not_removed,both sides are afraid obama might not have imposed sharia and come for all of your guns but hillary will almost certainly force your children to take classes in spanish about gay sex and how to be gangsta and then do door to door gun confiscation to make the genocide of white males easier they are very very afraid of losing the culture war i have large numbers of liberal friends who are afraid that trump supporters will get their guns and take to the streets on november and begin the plot of the turner diaries when he refuses to concede both of these views are somewhat warped however it would be a little easier to make my liberal friends less paranoid if the right would stop it with the amendment solutions talk i know this is utter bullshit but some of my liberal friends dont
SubredditDrama,not_removed,haha nah man no person has ever been fired for something they didnt do i mean what kind of crazy world do people think we live in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we have multiple instances of not just fake videos doing that but his own fake videos doing that he got acorn shut down and people from planned parenthood fired neither organization did anything wrong he lost a fraud suit and he has also had to pay six figure defamation suits its not hard to get people to say what you want by asking leading questions hypotheticals etc hes a fraud and you should stop defending it as legit because he has a history of doing this and literally every video was proved basically a hoax
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you sure httpsenwikipediaorgwikifiringofshirleysherrod
SubredditDrama,not_removed,employers are afraid of bad publicity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i typed up a whole response and it seems to have disappeared so forgive me if i reply twice i dont have the energy to go into it all again so ill just restate my key point which is that i agree that there is a real sense of disenfranchisement on the part of both liberals and conservatives that has fueled both the bernie sanders and trump populist movements and imo they arent wrong for feeling that the establishment has not been faithful in representing their interests i think taking money out of politics is something huge that we need to do i agree with trump on that but basically nothing else i think the dems are ideologically better suited to address this if they are willing to take on income inequality education costs healthcare costs childcare costs et cetera but they have to actually do those things not just pay lip service to them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,regardless america has not been this polarized since imo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so the right is full of saints ok
SubredditDrama,not_removed,speaking of mental gymnastics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not really sure if thats a kidadult thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i really hate that bs when they go around calling anyone that doesnt supports rapey the clown a ctr shill
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre doing it again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whoops now i feel stupid for replying seriously to sarcasm ive seen a bit too much of that being said without a hint of irony
SubredditDrama,not_removed,alt right is a made up term too but that isnt going to stop you from using it i also find it adorable that radicals have somehow managed to make not being a radical a bad thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean of course theyre doing it for attention and to be superior no rational person would look at two extremes and say nah that aint for me or anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,granted they were stopped before it happened tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt watch because im not a moron but through selective editing and out of context soundbites i would assume just like he always does why does the slimy fucker not release the raw footage if theres no way to misconstrue what was said
SubredditDrama,not_removed,alright yeah that makes sense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,voting in linked threads is like jay walking technically illegal but no one is going to enforce it unless its an extraordinary circumstance popcorn pissing is obvious when a drama is days old linked in here and minutes later you see new comments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is how it is for me until trump ive never been literally afraid of a presidential candidate getting elected ive never been afraid of a constitutional crisis happening in my lifetime but i am now and im not even a liberal im a moderate whos socially liberal and fiscallyforeign policy conservative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont like taking political sides but i do agree with your initial statement people do weird things out of fear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only one group is threatening to physically harm the opposition leader only one side has applauded the idea of jailing a political opponent and not accepting the results of the election i am so fucking tired of this both parties are the same bullshit the gop lives in some alternate reality and they must be stopped the right has proven itself to be dangerous not the left
SubredditDrama,not_removed,obama might not havecome for all of your guns not from lack of trying acting like he didnt go after guns just because he failed to get any legislation pushed through a republicancontrolled congress is disingenuous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there arent any reasonable people getting excited about a trump presidency
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think reddit is protrump is more like the minority of trump supporters are very loud
SubredditDrama,not_removed,spend mins on rpolitics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and imo they arent wrong for feeling that the establishment has not been faithful in representing their interests i think taking money out of politics is something huge that we need to do i agree with trump on that but basically nothing else i think the dems are ideologically better suited to address this if they are willing to take on income inequality education costs healthcare costs childcare costs et cetera but they have to actually do those things not just pay lip service to them agree trump terrifies me but i understand where a lot of his supporters are coming from i was all for bernie and am sad he didnt make it normally i would never vote for the likes of hillary but i find myself very much in the anything but trump camp and hilary is the way to vote to accomplish that goal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that was years before i was born but i have no reason to doubt you in half my lifetime ive seen previously reasonable friends become zealots on both sides for their particular flavor of politicing each election cycle becoming more serious than the next the disagreement doesnt concern me what concerns me is when either side refuses to work with the other the refusal to vote on garland disgusts me as does the call for democrats to not work with trump our founding fathers honestly would be fucking disgusted that we are being so goddamned petty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is the left that is inciting and causing violence in american elections this is a fact
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly id trust a kid over a person hillarys age to work an email account
SubredditDrama,not_removed,doing what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he literally claimed the altleft a term he he made up to represent a political movement that doesnt exist is just as hateful as a real political movement that prides itself on being as hateful as humanly possible you can be le superior centrist in some cases but when you try to shoehorn that sort of thinking where it doesnt even apply by making shit up you show your true colors httpimgsxkcdcomcomicssheeplepng
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the admins will shadowban you if there are many people voting in the linked thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this there certainly is bias on the left everyone is biased but trump is legitimately steering us in the dangerous direction how much of it is bullshit hopefully all probably more than i think
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the gop who have carefully pushed trump to arms length
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like gamergate a passionate minority can appear to drown out the majority
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats one sub though and its more like probernie whove kinda transferred their allegiance onto hillary theres still considerable criticism of her upvoted there as long as it comes from the left and not the right none of the prohillary subs are anything like the huge rightleaning subs whore getting enraged at these damn liberals the video is such perfect ragebait that i hope it wasnt real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would have probably voted for anyone else on the pub ticket except for trump over clinton ii email boogaloo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how isnt hillary equally as terrifying she seems like a complete puppet thats what makes her so scary with trump it seems youre electing an idiot with hillary it seems you have no idea who youre actually giving power to given shell bend to political pressure and money in a heartbeat this election is a loselose
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you are so fucking wrong its frustrating
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously httpsenmwikipediaorgwikialtrightetymology
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre flaming up the entire thread with your dae cbesque posts cut it out now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is altleft a stupid term sure its just as dumb as altright and regressive left but terms are necessary in order label things concisely for clarification or things start to get really verbose and frustrating fairly quickly if you dont think that there are some leftists who are just as hateful and douchey as the people on the right who are hateful and douchey and thats clearly who the person you responded to was talking about i dont know what to tell you being centrist isnt only ever about being superior to either side especially when youre talking about two extremes for instance the kind of people who would attack a homeless person for supporting trump or the kind of people who think all muslims are terrorists and shouldnt be in the country im definitely a centrist there because i think both are wrong does that make me le reddit superior centrist or just a decent human being
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no personal attacks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats just mean dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who have carefully pushed trump to arms length as far as im concerned if they havent unendorsed him theyre still politically french kissing him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes and rthe donald is one sub overall this website is pro hillary and its silly to think otherwise
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump seems like way more of a puppet to me not to mention the fact that he empowers and gives a mainstream voice to extreme racists i mean sure hilary had some unsavory scandals but for me they pale in comparison to donalds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this election is a loselose no disagreement here for me hilary is the devil i know shes a corrupt specialinterestsbeholden washington insider i know that shell do just enough to appease her supporters while enriching her friends and largely maintaining the status quo trump on the other hand is a terrifying loose cannon he doesnt respect the office the country or the constitution im afraid hell ruin our foreign policy by badmouthing foreign rulers on twitter im afraid hell use his power to harm anyone who has ever insulted him and thats a lot of people im afraid that his uncivil rhetoric will undo the incredible progress weve made over the last decade on tolerance in our society im afraid that when his term is up hell refuse to leave the office and im sure that his economic policies will enrich his millionaire friends and decimate the countrys economy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aside from the typical arguments against trump as a lifelong hoosier allow me to raise one more his vp terrifies me pence is a whackjob but unlike trump he is able to hide it and present himself well as trump has basically said that his vp will be running most of the show if he becomes president that means pence will have way more power than im comfy with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,k
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont bait
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is altleft a stupid term sure its just as dumb as altright and regressive left but terms are necessary in order label things concisely for clarification or things start to get really verbose and frustrating fairly quickly okay so who does the altleft represent sanders hes hardly hateful and neither are his supporters outside of a very vocal few if you dont think that there are some leftists who are just as hateful and douchey as the people on the right who are hateful and douchey and thats clearly who the person you responded to was talking about i dont know what to tell you the thing is there are probably some people on the left who are just as bad as those on the altright however they dont even seem to exist as a coherent force outside of some blogs on tumblr and previously lj that literally nobody has heard of outside of tumblr or tiakia being centrist isnt only ever about being superior to either side especially when youre talking about two extremes good point when you portray both extremes as equivalent to each other even when one extreme is and the other is complaining about white people wearing dreadlocks on twitter you favor the former the entire reason people make fun of the superior centrist mentality is because of two things they attempt to portray the extreme ends of two groups as equivalent even when one side is clearly much worse they portray this as the only rational or normal choice instead of you know actually educating yourself and forming an opinion based on your observations its incredibly lazy because instead of looking at the actions of each side and coming to a conclusion you simply dismiss both as equally bad without even looking at them for instance the kind of people who would attack a homeless person for supporting trump or the kind of people who think all muslims are terrorists and shouldnt be in the country im definitely a centrist there because i think both are wrong does that make me le reddit superior centrist or just a decent human being youre comparing single events to each other instead of looking at the broader trends that are happening on each side people who oppose trump arent generally going around attacking homeless trump supporters but people who support him generally also support the deportation of mexicans and muslims on racial and religious lines constitutionality be damned forgive me for disagreeing with your narrative but theres a good goddamn reason why both sides are bad so vote republican is a meme
SubredditDrama,not_removed,snakes have long tongues
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not what puppet means to me i believe his motives and goals are internally generated to a fault he does what he wants to do and that can be a serious problem too but its the polar opposite of being a puppet if hes a puppet then whose is he
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im agreeing with you hombre chillax
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it means stop the snarky flaming youre doing in every comment in this thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,alt left is any leftist person whos views are not being currently represented by the dems in power i mean thats literally what altright is but on the right the thing is there are probably some people on the left who are just as bad as those on the altright however they dont even seem to exist s a coherent force outside of some blogs on tumblr yeah maybe you couldve convinced people of this tripe a few years ago but these people have institutional power and are in universities where you have more as professors than just runofthemill conservatives you cant just keep pawning off the well these people only exist on tumblr and tia meme as reality they portray this as the only rational or normal choice instead of you know actually educating yourself and forming an opinion based on your observations assuming the only reason people dont think the way you do is because they are uninformed and undereducated is just flat out wrong in addition to being unbearably pretentious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you havent really done anything to dispute his point though simply saying hurr youre full of shit isnt a compelling argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess my thought process was that hes very much manipulable by anyone who can inflate his ego and make him feel important and listened to like how he used to be a dem but started getting airtime on fox and seemingly just dropped off from there or how over the timeline of his presidential campaigns hes been propped up by right wing fascists that have given him the platform and confidence to say what he wants but youre right hes not controllable on the same sense that most politicians are weve seen the clinton campaign push that hes a russian puppet he probably isnt given any sort of direct orders but i can totally believe hes being guided by outside forces to someone elses gains he just seems predictable in that he always seems to take the bait no matter how obvious or detrimental in the long run
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whose puppet would he be putins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he may not be a direct puppet but by being impulsive and easy to bait into situations he could be a useful idiot to just about anyone that taunts him ive never seen a thinnerskinned bully in my life not even in elementary school
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fair points thanks for sharing them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you think he actually takes orders from putin and benefits directly from doing so or just that he is less opposed to him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no i dont think he takes orders from putin per se but i do think that putin manipulates trump without trump even necessarily realizing its going on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,our freind dprassel has a bit of history behind him and his games rgames has a pretty good list of his past adventures it was alleged that they used the result of the above got spiral studios banned from polycount which is pretty much the top forum for professional graphic artists orion started out as a source engine mod and had been making a push on the then new indiedb side of moddb with orion prelude but following the above took down the indiedb page for about half a year so as to lose the negative press it was generating praz aka david prassel was somewhat infamous on moddb for stealing borrowing other mods artwork and having public meltdowns when people called him on his bs was banned from neogaf for self promotion had a meltdown with everything from quoting himself to screencaps of emails of him spamming game press then getting mad when one responded thinking it was a mailing list renamed the company from spiral studios to trek industries to lose the negative press the company had associated with it httpstwittercomspiralgames on the games steam discussion forum he drops this fun tidbit i just cant believe that gamers are defending the moneyusing ♥♥♥wiping turds that is activision who abuses them with annual releases season passes map packs doesnt involve or listen to them in any way and you have us who literally pay money to do amazing fan service for content like you mentioned above which we give away that is the most disappointing aspect and its the largest core to the new idea i am going to present later today its up to the fans if you want orion going forward and youll need to make your voices heard one way or the other if you want orion it is yours otherwise this isnt what ive signed up for and i am way too old for this crap if you like orion get ready to show your support if you dont like orion make sure to avoid it get ready dude is going full meltdown and just in case you dont know why activisions lawyers are all up in orions grill look at top guns are from cod games advance warfare and i do believe bottom is a gun from orion which is pretty much parts from the top guns slapped together and given a slight re texture edit annnnnnnnnnd his account has been banned from the orion steam discussion page popcorn up boys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so the hacker works for reddit perhaps theyre one of the rpcmasterrace mods im honestly not sure how to react to this but im pretty sure it just made my day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ooh he pulled a streisand too hey this is david from trek industries i would like to offer everyone a chance to delete their posts before our lawyers get involved on this matter we will be pursuing lawsuits against everyone and anyone involved in spreading malicious falsehoods about me trek industries or orion if you delete your post now you can still avoid heavy fines and perhaps even prison best regards david prassel ceo of trek industries edit archive away kids make sure to post your court documents too when you get served
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow why nobody told me we have verizon here in russia plus even his log is wrong heres the right country namerussian federation not russia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not even behind seven proxies smh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol i saw that thread yesterday and was like fuck activision then i read for mins and saw this jackasss attempt really backfied what a doof
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is the tastiest morsel of drama in a long while for me no gender stuff no politicsjust a dumbass who stole assets and is trying like hell to hide that fact the fact that im currently playing black ops also helps p
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what exactly was he trying to walk back by claiming to be hacked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if that reddit post is him and why would some russian hacker do this its not even particularly funny its really silly there are no fines or jail time for defamation its a civil suit and good goddamned luck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so apparently i bought a copy of this game at some point in the distant past is steam going to leave it in my library forever as is or am i going to get a refund and lose it or just plain lose it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont really understand the specifics of this popcorn but its very tasty anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay so i dont understand all the computerspeak about obvious proxies or whatnot but that screenshot is obviously photoshopped because the fonts dont even match
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh this nuter is back again its nice that we always have at least one crazy video game developer thats active at a time phil fish molyneaux prassel keeps things exciting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt this the same guy who had a successful kickstarter fired his team and then dove behind the rank and file of gamergate when people started calling him out on it basically crying that kotaku had a personal vendetta against him or something i seem to recall the gamergate steam curator page trying really hard to spin his dinosaur game so it seemed like anything but a hacked together piece of cheap shovelware
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hahaha this post is courtesy of anonymous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the gift that keeps on giving
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i heard they started up a kickstarter or something very recently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like i hear a lot of stories of game and app devs and tech company entrepreneurs having online meltdowns and ethics scandals that they try to cover up like this is it like a personality type just bias since these cases are more memorable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aw this makes me sad i heard of orion when i saw a post on games about how far it had come and it was so cheap that i bought copies for my closest friends price to fun it was a great investment had no idea about any of this controversy i just liked shooting waves of dinos now i feel dumb for giving him money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i find it amusing he decided to use the whole but activision is the enemy not me attempt to derail im as leery of triple a developers and game companies as most people but when someone is obviously being false you have to call it im sure activision will do something to earn scorn eventually but this isnt it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh shit this is the dinobeatdown guy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im ready now what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the funniestsaddest thing was the kotaku guy just responding with unsubscribe i mean its hypocritical because its from a gawker site but still
SubredditDrama,not_removed,could it have been the hacker known as
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe someone should tell him for on the books libel laws in the us public figures are at a disadvantage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a little tempted to sticky a link to the thread on rshittyfoodporn and see if hell threaten to sue all of us too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god i wish i could comment in that thread to tell him to do it cause i bet he fucking wont the massive pussy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also the ipaddress of the hacker is all kinds of wrong reddit wouldnt show a address rather cheap fake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its as easy as editing the css via the inspect element command you can make it look like darth vader and hacked your account
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and the ip is iana restricted for local networks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shouldve used ten he wouldve gotten away with it for sure
SubredditDrama,not_removed,his games are also pretty fucking barebones plagiarism notwithstanding guardians of orion for some reason became a shitty diablo clone with defense elements and dino beatdown was sanctum with dinosaurs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he sent messages to users and made posts saying anyone talking bad about him would be sued
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if its like other games that get removed from the steam store if its installed on your computer steam wont uninstall it and you will be able to see it in your library but after the games page is gone and you uninstall you wont see it in your library and wont be able to install it again you wont get a refund
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youll keep it you just wont be able to buy it ever again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude gets his game taken down cus he stole designs from another company goes to social media for support reddit and everyone else realized he lied and the takedown was legit then the dude lies and says he was hacked lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how ethical of them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry about that guys anonymous got me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep an indiegogo its been reported multiple times from what ive read in other threads last i checked it was still up though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,prepare your anus wallet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its that in small companies where the owner is also the mouth piece the internet can be dangerous instead of running every thing you say through a pr team carefully managing your image you have an immediate outlet to the entire world on top of that the direct engagement means they also get all the mountains of criticism and hate and drama dumped right on their lap rather than getting brief sterilised reports can lead to ugly situations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes not quite as crazed as the carrot app guy but hes certainly close
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it might just be because of the shitshows they create in their wake they are just so memorable to everyone else i mean i remember the phil fish meltdown quite vividly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well for one id think theyre far more likely to have an online presence compared to people from other fields
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bummer for ya thats why i personally never give money to developers for kickstarters or anything way more shitty indy developers than good ones sadly on the flip side its good not everyone thinks like me or we wouldnt have the indy scene we do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hypocritical how is it hypocritical
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we cant be sure until we backtrace the hack
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its being hugely missed by most just how absurd that ip address is its only a bit less bad than saying i got hacked by my own computer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dino beatdown we trash
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because russian hackers are known for pursuing litigation on behalf of their hacking victims
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for almost all games removed from the store if you have purchased it it will still show in your library even if uninstalled i cant think of an example of one that is removed from your library and even if they did they would most likely refund your money it would be very anticonsumer to take away your license to a game and not refund you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good to know thanks not like ill have anybody to ever play it with although from the sounds of it its not fantastic anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,doesnt even look like he stole designs looks like he literally ripped the meshes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its very impressive he managed to fuck up all columns the ip is wrong its russian federation and not russia and we dont have verizon in russia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol nice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that campaign ends two months from now flexible funding goal with the first all from dprassel himself amusing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh my god do not get me started lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres also the guy who tweeted i am going to kill gabe newell he is going to die when steam failed to take the early access banner off his game for a couple of hours after its release they took a lot more than the early access banner off after that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i believe memorable is the word youre looking for
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im still mad about fez ii
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only kickstarter i ever gave money to was mighty no im still in mourning
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i give devs money for early access if they can give me a fun game that instant but backing a game which doesnt have its money worth of fun included already is a nogo only exception for that is if i got more than my moneys worth out of previous games i had no hesitations backing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre going to backtrace it consequences will still be the same though right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i got hacked by man the guy who has that ip is such a massive asshole
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shitty repetitive dumbeddown sanctum with reskinned dinosaurs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a part of putins plot to destabilize the west as a prelude for invading berlin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats good to know i have only owned two games that have been removed from the steam store and one of those is still installed because im still bummed about it getting canceled nosgoth the other game was some crappy indie horror game ive forgotten the name of that got taken down less than a month after it was put up i didnt get a refund and when i uninstalled it disappeared from my library and i dont even see it in my hidden section but maybe thats because it was taken down by the developers rather than by steam im curious now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i need to know who is the carrot app guy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rememorable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah you are right goes to show dont reddit on low sleep you will stay stupid stuff
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what ever happened with that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomume
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think five nights at freddys world was taken down by the developer who asked people to seek refunds from valve i know there have been a couple more that have been removed from steam but i cant recall their names and i guess i cant search google properly for a list
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it happened fairly recently about two weeks ago this software developer wrote an instantmessaging app called carrot and took it to reddit to show it off redditors installed it it turned out that the app did a lot of shady datamining and so on it made you upvote posts in the developers subreddit without your knowledge it got hold of some peoples work emails and tried to change their passwords etc the landslide started when one redditor said hey your program is doing weird shit whats the big idea and the developer replied by calling the redditors phone about a dozen times and sending that redditor a map with the redditors house pinpointed on it and saying why dont i swing by your house so we can discuss this i may have some of those events out of order so you can check my work by reading this giant writeup on the whole thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its just one thread out of many on this projects demise mind you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah what a douchebag
SubredditDrama,not_removed,omg im the cunt fuck you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and sending that redditor a map it was a different redditor with the redditors house pinpointed on it and saying why dont i swing by your house so we can discuss this of note the dev lived in canada and the map was of the guys house on the west coast the way it was written the redditor figured it was solely an intimidation tack i know where you live and all the dude ranged from creepy to downright lying he kept accusing me of being a competitor or troll to try and dismiss me whenever i called him out on his bullshit lol and while carrot is gone he and his pals are deep into startups he had this big profile on angellist so unfortunately hes probably still going to be trying to get at user data through other apps and shit and hiding his name now fucking creepy af
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow thanks for the info
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well yes and nounless im totally mistaken the dev did the map tactic on two different people and yeah it is creepy since this isnt the first time hes done this a poster from an india subreddit came forward and said hey i know this guyhe got in trouble before for making this voting app the dev made a lot of outrageous errors this time but what if he learns from these mistakes and tries it again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the people arguing about whether the free market will allow this to happen when the free market did in fact allow it to happen not that long ago need help
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe i was in retail too long but i feel libertarians and anarchists have more faith in the ability of people to make smart choices than i have ever managed to work up in my life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,libertarianism at least as manifested in this thread is a fine ideology if you assume that we are all robots with access to all information and acting rationally of the time bless their chinwhiskers i too entertained such thoughts as a wee young lad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,snake breeders arent a protected class oh and black people are are they endangered or something are they a different species could you be anymore racist please come on u guys why dont people take libertarians seriously s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont care if blacks are seated near me but if i were a waiter id probably prefer that restaurant for financial reasons what a gracious person willing to sit near black people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,american libertarianism the idea that property has rights but black people can fuck right off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are so many legally incorrect statements made in that thread i cant even snake owners are a protected class discrimination requires an invasion of privacy what the hell
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the real drama is on the children of the top comment imo theres no meaningful racism anymore i dont know what youre so worried about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and the other airlines would lose business of people who dont like flying with muslims basically everyone who voted for trump the vast majority of americans and even more vast majority of the world population as most airlines are international didnt vote for trump so good luck with that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,libertarians on the internet are just people who want to be edgy but who arent edgy enough for the alt right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the past year has made me really aware that without government intervention many people would find joy in denying me goods and services my dollars are now worth less because my skin is black how you gonna say that its your liberty to deny me mine i bet someone could make a fortune running an airline that bans muslims or a restaurant that bans blacks oh im sorry you are so fragile in your whiteness that me sitting next you minding my own goddman business is a threat to your pale skin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,comparing black people to snake breeders what planet am i on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,before i peek into that thread im just gonna guess the rights include killing people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i used to believe that i disliked libertarians more than the core republican base because at least some republicans arent deluded with complete social darwinism bullshit and at least say believe in charity more than your typical ayn randboy then they elected trump and i had to recant the statement so yeah
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hippity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,argues about to what extent private property rights should go all of them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that randpaul guy tore that thread up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pleasedontbeinthisdrama pleasedontbeinthisdrama pleasedontbeinthisdrama aww phew thank god
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah see the libertarians always have a get out of jail free card bad things happened in a largely unregulated free market doesnt count because simultaneously some level of government existed somewhere at the very same time one drop of government in a lake is enough to poison a whole town you know edit because not be cause
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everyday people prove to me that we cannot be left to our own decisions of the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its easy to support the rationality of the free market when you know you wont be affected by the irrational aspects of human behavior
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think that its about faith in peoples decision making so much as believing that bad decisions are punished in a way that leads to people that make good decisions running the show which is also tied in with the rights love for the just world fallacy ie poor people are poor because of the bad decisions theyve made and the rich are rich because of the good decisions theyve made its a really shitty ideology all around
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah basically i was a libertarian as a teenager and what drove me was the desire for a simple and consistent worldview i disliked paternalism and authoritarianism and valued the ideas of freedom and individualism so i followed those ideas to what i felt were their natural conclusions and it led me to libertarianism not quite ancap level though thankfully i didnt want any nuance in my political ideology anything that clashed with my individualist values eg publically funded schools healthcare etc was out just so i wouldnt have to experience cognitive dissonance the thing is i was aware that if all my ideas were put in place it would make the lives of lots of people significantly worse including mine probably my family wasnt rich but in my mind it was worth it if it led to a ideologically consistent system
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is ironic because they are themselves a pretty good example of the inverse of what they preach
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rbotsrights
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wonder why dont people rather entertain the opposite pessimistic libertarianism like how people are dumb idiots yes but it is the same people who vote so the government they choose is not any better so we cannot just decide ok we cannot trust the market and the fall back to something better as the government is created by the same people as the market is this makes a whole lot sense it follows neither the market nor a democracy is reliable but only a dictatorship of aristocratic experts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you dont think property owners should be allowed to discriminate against black people well youre the real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well yeah now that theyre not property
SubredditDrama,not_removed,snake owners are a protected class donut steppe on snek hiss hiss
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well you know since black people arent an endangered species it doesnt matter the person who said that in the linked thread might just make me want to bash my head against the wall
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or people who like smoking weed but dont like to share
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love the way people are trying to respond with the now now lets have a logical and calm debate about you not being able to go to certain stores or live in certain houses because youre black shit where they think its completely irrational for people to want to defend their own rights god libertarians are morons
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah communism libertarianism has never been tried
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn right its what has happened in flint
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly sometimes it feels like many libertarians are perfectly familiar with history theyre just okay with the outcome
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am not libertarian but have certain sympthies there this is absolutely true however the question is whether the government is more trustable i mean the problem with most nonlibertarian thinking is that if we cannot trust the market then we can fall back to some better like democracy what if not what if all the other options even worse the reason i am not a full libertarian is that i think good government is possible but it has to be antidemocratic but the reason they have a good point is somehow everybody forgets to ask the other question ok we cannot trust common people ok we cannot trust the market but who else can we trust why do we think politics delivers better results
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it is the other way around the libertarians i know are even more pessimistic than conservatives they dont rust the market is rational but they trust the government even less they simply think government is even more irrational because the same dumb people are making choices but for other people and not themselves and i like that point ok we cannot trust he market ok we cannot trust the common people but why can we trust the elites what if we cannot trust anyone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wonder about people who follow that sort of magical thinking are they completely insulated from the world around them or are they just pretending
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its good you were able to get out of that way of thinking
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a relevant subreddit fellow homo sapiens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah robots bots a robot is a machine a bot is software
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean some of them dothis is pretty much the logic behind why its okay when the market leads to a horrible outcome for someone they made bad choices so they deserve it with extra steps also the overlap with reactionary types when the true free market is portrayed as something where the people who deserve to run society can rise to the top
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats the point of even owning things if i cant lord it over some arbitrary group ive chosen to exclude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,endangered species lol how do minds work where they even put those two concepts together
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i got the unnerving skincrawling feeling that they actually think segregation was the natural state of things before that pesky federal government intervention forced people of different races to be together well if the black people are excluded from using that water fountain and toilet facilities then obviously theyd go and build their own to use duh stupid statist libertyhating libs they think black people need to be protected from discrimination theyre the real racists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the point of a government is that you have a bunch of people supposed all looking at one another so that any bad decisions are caught which is what the us system is supposed to be like it just isnt anymore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it is still not my point my point is not that stupid people deserve bad stuff my point is how to trust anyone to prevent it without getting corrupted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just in case you find it interesting you can use mdash to get a proper emdash on reddit then you dont have to use the awkward
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no idea i guess they were dumb enough to think that protected class literally means animals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in every country they are one fixed elite does not work that way a classic example how throughout their whole careers years centreleft mitterrand and centreright chirac could never really fall very far from the reins of power just sometimes closer sometimes farther
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i meant that as an example of how some libertarians already believe that most people are dumb idiots the idea that people deserve bad stuff isnt really the similarity just where the logic is most visible the dictatorship of their experts comes out in places like pinochets chile suhartos indonesia or yeltsins russia where a strongman implements policies chosen with the advice of expert economists edit theyre really a good example of why the idea of rule by experts is flawed imo the definition of expertise is always one that benefits whoevers got power whether thats businesspeople aristocrats technocrats whatever the more a system is immune to popular accountability the more its idea of whats good for the public can diverge from the actual people who make up the public
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh tilmdashthanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think popular accountability is one of the most dangerous myths ever the people as such hardly ever really represent their own interests read mancur olson on why basically because too many people cannot coordinate there are always special interest groups what looks like a democratic upheaval like color revolutions is mostly just the more suave more intellectual type special interest groups popular the people democratic are mostly just mantles of more clever special interests what we could do is to coordinate the interests of the elites and the people we could try to make it so that they can only get rich if they make us rich so nassim taleb got it right it is not popular accountability but skin in the game that matters ie personal gains and losses for example we could have a system where politicians their kids and their grandkids gain the average wage all their lives this would motivate them to try to make the kind of economy education etc that makes the average guy productive and earn well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont mean theres a single entity called the people that has a unified will i mean that popular accountability is the ability of different people and interest groups to influence society if your society is set up so that it neglects some group that creates unrest and when enough of that builds up you get upheavals or have to suppress them theres not any way for people to avoid conflicting goals completely but democracy offers a way to compromise compete and resolve differences without just having one group suppress the other when something is run by an elite group instead of in a more democratic way that creates a separation in power between them and everyone else that fuels the problem capitalism does it with economic power aristocracy does it with inherited power etc the divisions can be weakened with checks and balances and other sources of power but ultimately elites will push to increase the divide like the billionaires who fund libertarian thinkers to roll back the parts of the state that limit their economic power and excluded people will try to change it even if the elite class is created based on some idea of merit and designed to govern for the benefit of everyone making them into an elite gives them separate interests for your example tying politicians wages to the average lets them make more if wages go up but also if they skew the average or use a less accurate measure that looks higher or make policies that raise wages but hurt people in other ways without other people being able to push for different policies theres no way to counter that effect
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now watch this thread devolve into a flame war the circumcision debate is as flammable as pubic hair doused in petrol edit before people lose their shit a very good history on circumcision for the sake of keeping the debate somewhat grounded in knowledge
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus fucking christ circumcision drama again male circumcision is unnecessary but not a big deal settle the fuck down everyone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes call them while youre at it better also call child services on behalf of the one third of the male population of the planet who are also circumcised¹ something must be done thats it there are a lot more savages running around than i thought
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol pubic hair isnt flammable come on man edit obviously pubes are flammable holy fuck the pms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when you tell a large majority of men that one is the key characteristics of what defines a man is somehow wrong youre gonna get trouble and thats basically what circumcision debates do they tell one large portion of males that their penis is wrong and gross which portion youre telling that to is what swaps based on the debate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im so psyched for another thread in which reddit tells me my penis is wrong and that my parents abused me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why is it that circumcision is so fiercely fought over specifically on reddit anyways
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its obviously a big deal to some people and telling people to just settle down and shut the fuck up is highly patronizing i personally find it highly bizarre that we would send parents to prison for getting their kids a tattoo but are totally cool with elective surgery but just one kind for cultural reasons neither is a big deal in the grand scheme of things after all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,idk but the fact that i had a part of me removed without my consent for an unnecessary reason pisses me off hopefully this thread wont go off the rails and i wont regret this comment but thats my opinion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,edgy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til muslims jews americans and south koreans are savages
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do what you want with your own dick but putting a sharp blade anywhere near a childs privates doesnt seem right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly the vocal individuals of both sides just want to shame the other the more they attack the more others dig in thats why we have srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt tell anyone to shut the fuck up but ok also if i had a son i wouldnt get him circumcised because theres just no need but hundreds of millions of men on earth right now are circumcised with no problem so people acting like its barbaric is ridiculous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whoa settle down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and thats fair but likewise its necessary to remember that there are plenty of circumcised people who like it or dont care im a circumcised dude and it pisses me off when people say im wrong for being okay with it or that im somehow less of a person like talking about the general practice is fine but these threads always go into personal insults
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the foreskin is homologous to the clitoral hood not the labia there actually was a brief trend of clitoral hood removal in like the it was supposed to increase sexual sensitivity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant really comment on female circumcision because i dont know anything about its safety prevalence or what its like to be a circumcised female but im a circumcised male without issue as are hundreds of millions of others that being said if i have a son i wont circumcise him because theres just no need and a baby is perfect without any modification but if someone else wants to circumcise their child its not barbaric or worth child services being called or throwing a fit over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for christ sake stop male and female circumcision are not the same stop equating the two
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because people go absolutely bonkers over it and act like it is the worst thing that could ever happen worse than militant vegans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean hed also know that just from reading the title so that remark seems out of place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is actually years old if you read the thread instead of commenting by just reading titles youd know that a bit condescending
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you misunderstand by thats it i meant that i was surprised the number was that low the savages are the ones who arent circumcised but i was just trolling anyways
SubredditDrama,not_removed,warning item dude tries to eliminate his overgrown pubes by lighting them on fire shockingly it doesnt go as planned might contain content that is not suitable for all ages i think im ok not seeing that but thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i refuse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i should have removed the majority part as an australian when i wrote majority by accident i meant telling uncut men that theyre dicks are wrong because thats how it feels to me personally when people said uncut is unhygenicharder to cleanunattractivewhatever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not disagreeing with you im uncircumcised myself and i live in countries where its just not the normal thing but when it comes right down to it all of these fights boil down to my manhood isnt deformed so it must be yours that is on both sides
SubredditDrama,not_removed,personally i think its more the opposite everyone wants to not be shamed the backlash is because no one wants to be told their dick is wrong and since its not my dick thats wrong it must be yours right i think its all just a giant fight about not wanting to be judged as lesser it just so happens that the means to do that fight has been by judging the other side instead
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you really cant make arguments like that from prevalence and the number of circumcised men in the world is irrelevant as to the ethics of the procedure i dont think that most people who are circumcised experience any real problems from it the procedure seems pretty safe but its still a weird practice and we have to bend over backwards in our ethics to allow it anything else even remotely similar is banned outright because we consider things like that outside of parental rights but circumcision is ok because its common thats not how questions like that are supposed to be answered
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what how can you say that because men are circumcised with no problem then its not barbaric that logic makes no sense if i tortured you as a baby but you didnt remember it and it had no lasting impact on your life would it not be barbaric
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im happy that you are happy but i see little to no reason to keep this tradition alive if you want to do it when you are a consenting adult or its deemed medically necessary then by all means do it my gripe is doing it to infants who have no say if i had been given the choice i wouldnt do it to myself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you cant clean your baby why have a child
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and chopping off your hand lowers the chance of hand cancer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,alright thank you ill fix that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,note that these days wed send parents to prison over even the basic clitoral hood sort of fgm and thats a good thing some things arent for parents to mess with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no namecalling or insults please
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how does someone plan for that to go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its a majority on reddit because its mainly americans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont understand why any of this is so personal i dont think that anyone is deformed or that their penis is wrong but i do think its pretty fucked for parents to perform surgical alterations for cultural or cosmetic reasons outside of special circumstances like birth defects etc its the ethics of the procedure that disturb me not the effects
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah its basically as you said
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree its weird but like you said the procedure is pretty safe and its a very common tradition for thousands of years so why lose your mind over it its absolutely silly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on the contrary your logic of something thats mostly harmless being barbaric makes no sense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also the most common types of female circumcision involve removing the clitoris entirely which would be equivalent to the removal of the entire head of the penis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,labiaplasty is a thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean if infant clitoral hood removal was a longstanding religious practice that was not commonly associated with any more severe practices wed allow it just like we allow male circumcision
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because thats pointless i made it clear in my last post i believe theres no need to circumcise someone please read what im writing and quit wasting my time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,looked it up its americans so youre right but the debate extends far outside of reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup there are strong arguments that people have but they arent why the debates get heated the arguments are only there to reinforce peoples emotional feelings over the matter especially since its not really something you can change about yourself well i could get snipped but ugh no that sounds painful
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not losing my mind over anything i just think it should be banned im not going to go out in the streets or demonstrate for it but it seems like a fundamentally wrong thing to allow people to do to their kids in the name of tradition scarification is also safe and has been very common for hundreds of thousands of years but we dont let people do it to kids anymore even on tribal land
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably but thats fucked and shows just how inconsistent we are about these kinds of principles
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry i didnt mean you losing your mind i meant how some people in the linked thread and this thread are losing their minds someone in the other thread said theyd call child protective services on parents who had their child circumcisedjust embarrassing levels of outrage id be fine with it being banned and im also fine with it not being banned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you also have to consider that because its a pretty safe procedure and moreover pretty important to certain religions ie literally just the jews that trying to just have circumcisions banned would probably spark a lot of outrage among those communities and might even violate certain laws set in place to protect religious beliefs and practices edit im being downvoted but not replied to which i guess means that people hate me for having a mutilated penis or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think you should make decisions for your children including circumcision your analogy is bad tho because a circumcised penis doesnt necessarily have any religious significance and most people dont have a problem with being circumcised whereas im guessing most people wouldnt like a religious tattoo put on them without their knowledge also circumcision is not illegal most places so the law is not against you in circumcision another reason the analogy doesnt work
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people get their kids ears pierced but they hardly ever get their kids eyebrows pierced why not because one is a longstanding tradition in our culture and one isnt big deal as a jew i dont really get a good feeling from people trying to outlaw circumcision because historically that hasnt been an auspicious sign
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most people dont have a problem with being circumcised well to be fair those that are circumcised tend to have had the procedure when they were very young and thus dont know anything else its normal as far as theyre concerned adult men who arent circumcised tend not to elect to have the procedure done of those who are circumcised it doesnt seem unreasonable to conclude that had they not been the proportion of those electing to have the procedure would not change that is had they not had the procedure done they would later not opt to have the procedure done of their own volition of course if those who had the procedure done when they were babies had their prepuce regrew overnight they would almost certainly have the procedure done again because to them its presence is not normal in the same way that if some sort of weird home invader broke into homes and circumcised men in their sleep they would be equally displeased
SubredditDrama,not_removed,circumcision is an ancient tradition and culturally accepted if we had a tradition of tattooing a small symbol on a babys ass for hundreds of years im sure wed be having that debate too and tons of people would be defending the practice because they never minded their ass tattoo if the idea of circumcision didnt exist until recently wed have laws against it kind of like how in the us it would be illegal to trim a baby girls labia even though that would be just a cosmetic procedure akin to circumcision and adults are allowed to get it but if we had a really old tradition of trimming off baby inner labia it would be legal and accepted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its kinda only weirder when its just a cosmetic thing and what if it was a really bitchin tattoo whether someone likes the end result or not is not especially important when youre dealing with ethics of things like this also people are remarkably adaptable and in countries where fgm is prevalent most women dont have a problem with it and indeed are a big driver in forcing the procedure on other women and thats even for procedures that involve loss of functionality humans are pretty strange
SubredditDrama,not_removed,piercing a childs anything is a questionable practice too and is also often driven by cultural stereotypes or viewed as a rite of passage but in general its a bit less permanent than other forms of ritual body modification as a jew i dont really get a good feeling from people trying to outlaw circumcision because historically that hasnt been an auspicious sign there isnt really an antisemitic or antiislamic etc bent to the modern circumcision debate and many people practicing routine infant circumcision arent affiliated with any of those groups your tradition would adapt just as others did there are a lot of groups that no longer can practice cultural body modification on children as they used to things change sometimes and those who want to pay homage to tradition can still find a way hell as a symbol of covenant with god the procedure would mean a lot more if people did it voluntarily as they came of age
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean you can compare circumcision to an infant getting its ears pierced but i dont think its the perfect analogy the thing is many people get their ears pierced at an older age but i dont think that many people will get circumcised when they get older so the idea that its its procedure thats going to happen anyway which applies to pierced ears doesnt hold for circumcision i think that kind of obviates the benefits or at least the justification for infant circumcision vs infant ear piercing if you wanted to make a more apt comparison you would compare it to getting an infants cartilage of the of the ear pierced much less likely to happen at an older age and definitely more painful also its a bit of a dick move to imply that anticircumcision people are closet nazis or something of the sort just saying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre the one who compared circumcision to a religious tattoo so if it doesnt matter why did you use that example like i said its a bad analogy youre the one who brought up legality and said the law wouldnt be on my side not me im aware circumcision is not popular in many places it doesnt change the fact that hundreds of millions of men are happily circumcised are you being wilfully obtuse i have a hard time believing youre having such a hard time following this conversation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but thats just it the procedure doesnt leave a person worse off its just aesthetic im not saying a circumcised dick is better nor that people should circumcise their children im just saying that its harmless enough that theres no reason for people to be losing their minds over it as some are whether you agree with it or not someone in the linked thread said theyd call child protective services on parents who circumcise their children it was comments like that im talking about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,imagine how different the world would be if gods covenant with abraham involved giving all babies rad tramp stamps
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not against not circumcising your baby its just not as big a deal as people make it there are many things that are accepted today because they are tradition and it doesnt make them right or wrong but losing your mind over a tradition that is relatively harmless is just silly righteous indignation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you under the impression that nobody has ever outlawed circumcision before surprise people have been trying to ban it for almost as long as jews have been doing it you might not think your objection to it has anything to do with antisemitism but the fact is that the tradition of trying to ban this most fundamental of jewish practices originated well before anybody ever thought of there being some kind of ethical problem with it we still kept doing it though because its an extremely important part of our covenant with god and no offense but we dont really care what gentiles think about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the thing is that outlawing circumcision is tantamount to outlawing judaism it doesnt really matter why you want to do it its inherently an antisemitic policy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay a couple things regardless of the debatable number there are nerve endings a lot of them in the foreskin there are other reasons a foreskin is useful whereas most of the reasons for circumcision can be addressed with basic hygiene and safe sex as most of the world can attest anesthetic isnt perfect nor is it permanent injected anesthetic makes the penis swell and the surgery harder so is more rarely used general anesthetic is dangerous topical anesthetic is somewhat lacking when it comes to having part of your dick torn off its also going to hurt for days afterwards obviously and there isnt going to be anesthetic for that part httpwwwcirporglibraryprocedureplastibell httpwwwcircumstitionscomdeathhtml i wasnt going to reply but to say it is a purely cosmetic procedure or to imply that it is perfectly safe is patently false im circumcised and i wish i wasnt neither of my parents are jewish and it was a purely cultural decision if nothing else i wish i had the choice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i only really addressed most people dont have a problem with being circumcised and how it is not a reasonable argument in favour of it im just saying that its harmless enough that theres no reason for people to be losing their minds over it as some are i suppose we disagree then maybe im the crazy one here with offthewall ideas but to me it doesnt seem that cutting up another persons genitals without their consent is right the fact that its a baby and therefore cannot consent doesnt make that go away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my little boys tramp stamp was mostly harmless i dont get what the big fuss is about now hes got an awesome firebreathing dragon just above his ass and since he got it done as a baby he wont remember the pain or experience the discomfort he would if hed gotten it at
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is the perspective of people who are against circumcision its an unnecessary procedure that causes suffering the only humane thing to do about something that causes suffering is to end it immediately theres not really a middle ground so i guess people on both sides end up sounding crazy because theres no way to compromise
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you might not think your objection to it has anything to do with antisemitism but the fact is that the tradition of trying to ban this most fundamental of jewish practices originated well before anybody ever thought of there being some kind of ethical problem with it my objection doesnt have anything to do with antisemitism or antiislamism or antiwaspism or anything else its a basic ownershipofself issue have people tried it before as a way to illegitimize jews and muslims probably but there are also plenty of perfectly neutral ethical reasons to limit practices like this to times of medical necessity and infant circumcision does conflict with some of our fundamental views on rights as a person there are times when religious traditions will conflict with modern and yes ever changing laws the compromises any given society makes for minorities have their limits people who go on with outlawed cultural practices slowly become extremists and the general body of a culture or faith tends to move on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can read just fine the problem is youre floundering so hard to put up an argument that youre saying all these things that have nothing to do with anything and that you now just have to say ok pretend i didnt say that and when i brought up legality it was only pertaining to this straw man i brought up and people being happy with it means everything it means were talking about a procedure that people are glad was done because they find it aesthetically pleasing and has negligible downsides were not talking about people being conditioned to like something terrible that was done to them were talking about people liking the outcome of a procedure that has almost had no effect on them aside from an aesthetic difference you really dont have a leg to stand on here and all your angry ranting is getting you nowhere ill also remind you that i would be fine if no one was circumcised again im not saying everyone should do it its just not as big a deal as people make it when they have nothing to do but get rigorously indignation on the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that guy is probably the edgy kid in class who likes to wear tshirts with swear words on them to really stick it to the normies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,objectivist libertarian ultranationalist moderate ok can someone break this down for me looks like alphabet soup to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everyone is equally slaves in the eyes of zul
SubredditDrama,not_removed,does anyone actually take moral relativism seriously anymore i havent really seen any arguments for it that go beyond morals vary from culture to culture so they must be inconsistent and meaningless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,worst is such a subjective term dude isnt even denying hes a piece of shit his argument is just that its really hard to judge the worst piece of shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its because noone expected leave to really win not even leavers i voted leave and didnt expect us to win it just wasnt supposed to happen but that could be as a result of zero confidence in the democratic process to do whats right for the nation hence the lack of a plan now that it has i think people are finally starting to get their heads round it after a few days of shock remainers insisting that because leave hasnt invoked article therefore are clueless are morons so im not surprised that they have no clue about the art of negotiation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,objectivist libertarian ultranationalist moderate why would you use both ultra and moderate in your title
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at least they admit it everyone else will pretend they give a shit long enough to enjoy feeling superior by downvoting and telling them how terrible they are then theyll pretend to give a shit long enough to share some stupid awareness meme on facebook so people can see how kind and progressive they are then theyll go right back to enjoying their slavery produced products and spending their money on a bunch of shit they dont need honestly if half the western world gave a shit as much as it claims it could have ended a lot of the suffering it chooses to post self righteously about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the ability to denounce child labor low wages or bad conditions is a luxury of wealth countries where we have child labor sweatshops they often dont have the wealth needed for them sweatshops are the best bet to spur investment in the country get some capital going and develop to the point where they can invest in human capital send kids to school instead of the factory this hamstering is almost always historically counter to reality in most countries nonagricultural child labor was banned in america during the great depression when the argument of us not being able to afford it would apply the most in the twenties the roaring twenties a proposed amendment would have prohibited child labor but the measure was blocked for the reasons mentioned here that the reason children worked in factories is because it was their best bet that was during americas most prosperous period ever at the time yet america managed to afford the labor standards and climbed out of the great depression shortly after and even being able to afford the war effort
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wonder which side of the debate has the guy who is okay with slavery of nonwhites
SubredditDrama,not_removed,following the rbadphilosophy link where do ethics come from then what fundamental equations of the universe describe morality ahhh the sophistry stings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that dude goes to such lengths to sound rational and informed but he ends up just making himself look like an idiot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the tshirts are only a stopgap to tide him over until theyre forced to work in his factories in the glorious libertarianfascist future
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is your brain on year old i have it all figured out cultural relativism

SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you the key master
SubredditDrama,not_removed,zuul
SubredditDrama,not_removed,interestingly enough ive seen several threads on rsubredditdrama that defends relativism of course that was for vegans rather than slavery it seems that most people who defend relativism do so in order to defend a metaethical view rather than having to go and defend their actual ethical view it seems to be much simpler to defend relativism than to defend a faulty normative view or so says one of my philosophy teachers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,moral relativism isnt taken very seriously in academic philosophy these days especially cultural relativism way waaaay too many holes there is a pretty strong contingent of antirealists most of whom claim that moral facts are somehow minddependent expressivists for instance think morals are more or less just attitudes so saying murder is wrong is analogous to saying boo murder i often suspect when people say morality is subjective theyre expressing some kind of naive expressivism there are many arguments back and forth on it the fregegeach problem for instance but actual antirealists have a way stronger program than just sometimes people disagree therefore morality dont real its odd though so many people on this site seem to think that contemporary philosophers are all either rabid moral relativists or theistic divine command theorists but i dont think you could pick two less popular positions in contemporary analytic phil than those two

SubredditDrama,not_removed,sure they do moral relativism doesnt say they vary so they must be meaningless it says you cannot claim to have a set of morals that are inherently more valuable or righteous than anothers if you ask me calling your morals objective is the fastest way to justify oppressing others lets talk about fgm for instance i think most of us can say its a bad practice certainly for those affected its quite brutal lets say a father has the practice done for his daughter you ask him why would you ever do something like that for your daughter and he replies with i want her to have a good life and shell never be able to marry someone respectable if she doesnt have the procedure done so hes doing something that he believes and is probably right about will help her in the long run course its not his body its not necessarily with her consent and its downright awful in its own way which moral system is the right one here or lets turn it around vaccination a situation where some parents might opt not to vaccinate their kids because they view it as an abhorrent practice that can harm their child and want to respect their individual right to not be subjected to treatments they cant even really consent to of course this not only very likely can end up hurting them in the long run but also hurt the collective by spreading pathogens the former situation is wrong if you believe in individualism and selfdetermination and hold those values up as ethically and objectively moral but the latter isnt and then you have the even more thorny proposition of whether or not its moral to make others follow your morals so what youre gonna tell that father how to live his and his daughters life is even telling someone their morals are wrong morally right is forcing them onto them right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people on the internet wit no ethics education if that counts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean fundamentally id say theres a lot of virtue to moral relativism but i think a lot of people take it too far they take the notion that morality is subjective and turn it into morality is meaningless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes fgm is only bad if you are a swine cultural imperialist local traditions should be respected
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean who really does want to find the absolute worst piece of shit imaginable like what scale you even use and is the worst piece of shit the shittiest piece of shit or the piece of shit thats shittiest at being a piece of shit and i cant even imagine finding what i imagine to be the worst piece of shit possible then thinking to myself lets try and find an even shittier one because this wasnt bad enough but i have to know if its the worst
SubredditDrama,not_removed,extreme views moderate actions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you get it its not that i enjoy slavery its that i couldnt care less
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ultranationalist is also me first
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think you can use the prefix of ultra and then claim to be a moderate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like a session imperial ipa
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like the word moderate has become some sort of like token on this site people seem to think you can just spew hate and then be like no guys im totes a moderate outside of this one issue and get away with it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can drop the oxy and your statement still works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he doesnt want to destroy other nations like an extremist ultranationalist hes willing to settle for keeping them around as groveling slave labor
SubredditDrama,not_removed,more like year old anarchist whos never considered that survival of the fittest would probably just end with him dying of consumption
SubredditDrama,not_removed,very well put im saving this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,would you be willing to explain the differences between expressivism and moral relativism for us philistines
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this sort of thing would likely get into the territory of the ethics division of philosophy right i have some crossover experience with ethics and with moral psychology so im super curious as to what is currently ethically trendy has utilitarianism come back into vogue do people still like talking about kant because his name kind of sounds like cunt does anyone talk about wd ross or are there a whole bunch of new last names i would have to learn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the representatives of philosophy on reddit arent actually stellar advocates for their field
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the important development that has been enabled by the decline of both extreme moral relativism and absolute theistic morality is that morality can be both circumstantial and real at the same time particularly it is possible to hold the position that there is no metaphysical good or evil that transcends humanity and time while also acknowledging that humans have an innate sense of right and wrong which is sourced at least partly from evolutionary pressures in that sense you can talk about an objective moral code that exists within the scope of humanity and thus make moral judgments as humans even though it doesnt have any external meaning
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the thing is ethics is not about broadly defined values like individual self determinism if an act violates a persons autonomy that can be one reason why its morally wrong but it also depends on the harm it causes not vaccinating is fine if it doesnt harm anyone else but the fact is that it risks spreading disease to others it clearly causes more harm than the act of mandatory vaccinating which may or may not violate a made up sense of autonomy but still is not wrong and fga isnt wrong because it violates a persons rights though it does it is wrong the same way assaulting a stranger or intentionally disfiguring someone innocent is wrong the intentions of the father are irrelevanteven if it really would have some benefits for a woman within her culture like marriage prospects the fact that it is necessary for those benefits is still fucked up you cant just pull some wishy washy but can you really say anything is right or wrong because things are right or wrong some of them are debatable but not the ones you chose as examples if you hold cultural relativism to be true youd have to concede that there are as many moral systems as there are individuals since no culture has absolute agreement in their beliefs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,calling your morals objective is the fastest way to justify oppressing others why does that matter though if morality is relative who are you to say that oppression is inherently bad because after all that is a subjective moral judgement which moral system is the right one here isnt answering that question the entire point of realistic moral philosophy there are lots of ways to come to a conclusion about what is morally correct to do in a given situation but just saying well x thought it way okay to do y so it is okay for x to do y just seems like a very lazy one and then you have the even more thorny proposition of whether or not its moral to make others follow your morals thats a totally separate issue from validity of moral relativism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mentioning fgm to defend cultural relativism in srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,calling your morals objective is the fastest way to justify oppressing others my society says its moral to oppress others your argument fails
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe we first but only as a proxy for me first
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it gives the wordsalad result and it looks like the loaded questions give you plenty of chances to contradict yourself im apparently a socialist progovernment bleedingheart libertine so maybe he took it and gave the opposite answers i did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably lifted them out of a paradox game after deciding that they were totally valid sources of political opinion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what if youre ultramoderate checkmate ancaps
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can claim whatever i want
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what if im a moderate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am pretty sure i had one of those at the last beer festival i went to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a liberal but ive had it with these feminazis and the fascists of the regressive left also dae think george soros is literally plotting the downfall of western civilization
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the problem is the comparisons people make when determining their views you can hate illegal immigrants and forcefully expel them yet view yourself as a moderate if the scale youre using goes from give them my own personal home to round them up and systematically exterminate them

SubredditDrama,not_removed,ultranationalist is literally incompatible with anarchism edit oh you anarchocapitalism not anarchism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,moral relativism is a normative theory do x because your culturesocietyetc says its morally good expressivism is a metaethical theory that says all moral statementscommandsetc amount to things like yay giving to charity or boo stealing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im very much a beginner when it comes to philosophy so take what i sat with a grain of salt but afaik metaethical moral relativism is basically just the idea that you cant say that any one moral system is better than any other and that no moral theory is objectively right or wrong while expressivism is a school of metaethical thought that claims that moral language doesnt state any fact about the nature of that act but rather that such language is simply a way of expressing a attitude or emotion eg saying killing is wrong expresses nothing about the nature of killing and is basically the same as saying booooo i dont like killing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,keep in mind im not a professional philosopher i did an ma program a few years ago and then left the field well theres a split in phil between normative ethics which is determing the criteria of right action kant utilitarianism etc and metaethics which are broader questions like the status of moral facts moral realismantirealism falls under the latter category metaethics are far trendier than normative and have been since the late i would say its probably just because metaethics has a more diverse set of problems people complain about trolleyology in normative ethics the perception that normative ethicists are just fiddling with the same intuition pumps and arguments meta has a larger well to draw from and tends to in my opinion produce more interesting discussions particularly when it draws on other fields like moral psychology in normative the trend seems to be consequentialism coming back a bit it took a heavy hit from people like bernad williams about years ago but its back virtue ethics has had its moment in the sun as the new thing but its fading people seem tired of it especially because virtue ethicists dont often engage with normative questions in the same way in meta while realism of whatever form is still mostly dominant the hot thing is quasirealism korsgaards who is a neokantian constructivism along with other forms are really hot mostly it appeals to many of the antirealist intuitions while avoiding lots of the baggage especially about truthstatements the really interesting trend there though is that constructivists especially are beginning to look more and more realist or at least are accused of drifting towards realism also error theory has made a comeback its is the hardline version of antirealism which can be summed up by anime morality was a mistake edit wd ross suuuuuuucks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id disagree most of the top mods and flaired users at rphilosophy and raskphilosophy know their shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well thats if youre measuring what is right or wrong directly on who is physically harmed many would consider the violation of individual freedom to choose a more significant harm and consider the risk involved with spreading disease a necessary risk to protect that liberty what is more harmful depends on your personal values and fga isnt wrong because it violates a persons rights though it does it is wrong the same way assaulting a stranger or intentionally disfiguring someone innocent is wrong the intentions of the father are irrelevanteven if it really would have some benefits for a woman within her culture like marriage prospects the fact that it is necessary for those benefits is still fucked up is an unborn fetus an innocent at what point does it receive the protections an innocent would does it start at conception does it start at birth or somewhere in between because many would say that the deliberate killing of a potential life is akin to assault or murder and even though there might be gains from it that act itself is fucked up and the mothers intentions are irrelevant some of them are debatable but not the ones you chose as examples those subjects are absolutely debatable they might not be debated as much in your circles because theres more universal agreement in those on what is right or wrong but its important to recognize that there are those who feel entirely different on the subject if you wanna still say its right or wrong fine theyll disagree with you thats what moral relativism says youd have to concede that there are as many moral systems as there are individuals you just told me that the examples i used were not debatable for right or wrong so why do you suppose theres so much debate over them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why does that matter though if morality is relative who are you to say that oppression is inherently bad because after all that is a subjective moral judgement i think the problem here is that youve got a kind of odd idea about what moral relativism means to a lot of people i can make subjective judgments i have my own values and beliefs that makes me feel they are valid i dont need some kind of objective crutch to make the case for me moral relativism doesnt say that no morals can be considered right or wrong it says more that you cant say your morals are absolute and objectively right vs another isnt answering that question the entire point of realistic moral philosophy well no not really a large part of it is recognizing that there are actually different answers and no inherent right one and what you might act upon is going to depend on a value system normative moral relativists might teach that because of this people should be tolerant of different moral views which i hardly see as the same as saying every moral view is okay thats a totally separate issue from validity of moral relativism moral relativism the larger term i mean doesnt really need a case made for it you said does anyone take it seriously anymore and yes yes they do many do id go as far as to say a significant majority academics take it seriously i dont know how many personally prescribe to values falling under that penumbra but i know many more do for it than something like marxism but we study both and treat them as serious subjects all the same because theres inherent value in their teachings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did sam beckett just leap into that man with the chair

SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist authoritarian worldfederalist bleedingheart progressive lol that is some funny shit the only thing i would really challenge is that i am not a communist and that i support a mixed economy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rightleaning anarchist isolationist nativist liberal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,euthanasia abortion and suicide should all be legal one of those things are not like the others also liberalism refers to acceptance of historically illegal or immoral social practices or customs negative percentages indicate opposition to such acceptance not a political expert but i dont think that is what liberalism is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,first two questions are loaded stopped reading after that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist progovernment interventionist bleedingheart progressive i also got on tribalism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a communist progovernment interventionist i take issue with that bleedingheart libertine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,since were all doing this now socialist progovernment noninterventionist bleedingheart progressive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,note you can skip answers if you dont know or dont want to answer skipped answers count as maybe rofl also you are a communist authoritarian interventionist bleedingheart progressive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a communist progovernment humanist liberal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,socialist progovernment worldfederalist bleedingheart libertine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist progovernment worldfederalist bleedingheart progressive is bleeding heart like an actual thing i always thought it was more of a descriptor than a word associated with a particular ideology
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a communist authoritarian worldfederalist bleedingheart libertine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is the least biased survey ive ever seen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist progovernment interventionist cosmopolitan progressive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,socialist progovernment worldfederalist bleedingheart progressive accurate and unbiased
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i love these quizzes rightleaning libertarian totalisolationist bleedingheart liberal not the way i would describe myself personally but okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow even the first question is so beggared i just saw it panhandling next to a onelegged veteran
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist authoritarian multilateralist bleedingheart libertine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you are a socialist authoritarian worldfederalist cosmopolitan liberal apparently im going to take over the world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ultramoderate do you look like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean there is apperently a thing called httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiradicalcentrism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i claim you cant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,filthy xeno scum come here so that i may heatedly debate you about your opinion of our emprah
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah the funny thing is there is one called moxymoron or something like that i stole a cheap joke from a brewery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a liberal but i hate almost everything about modern liberalism but i want free health care and want to smoke weed so im super liberal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on the plus side you have a promising career as a mod of rthedonald
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont see how either of those two perspectives would preclude the other though if anything they seem complimentary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,both of those positions seem complimentary though if theres no objective morality then it would follow that moral statements cant truly be objective conversely if a persons comments on morality arent objective doesnt that imply that a persons views arent any more objective
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the really interesting trend there though is that constructivists especially are beginning to look more and more realist or at least are accused of drifting towards realism yeah im a constructivist who likes realism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no worries you have been most enlightening since virtue was back again does that mean people were putting more weight in things like the golden mean again consequentialism leaves a bad taste in my mouth due to its excessively inhibitoryrestrictive nature a mistake being a moral failing doesnt quite sit right with me im used to constructivism being used in a different context often referring to folks like jean piaget and cant really comment on metaethics as its beyond my purview but man all that sounds pretty interesting aww i always had a soft spot for that scottish git even if his latin uh had some issues
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is there such a thing as a professional philosopher in this day and age
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have my own values and beliefs that makes me feel they are valid i dont need some kind of objective crutch to make the case for me but what is the point of those judgements what meaning does a statement like oppression is bad hold if believe that oppression isnt necessarily wrong when other people do it a large part of it is recognizing that there are actually different answers and no inherent right one and what you might act upon is going to depend on a value system i said realistic moral philosophy many people would tell you that there are inherently right answers to many moral questions because most people believe that there are absolute moral truths even moral relativists moral relativism the larger term i mean doesnt really need a case made for it why i mean i get that its cool because it opens the door for more tolerance but that doesnt make it an infallible or even inherently valuable philosophy i dont even disagree with idea that its worth teaching and studying i just think its silly to say it shouldnt need to have a case made for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,moral relativism doesnt avoid the problem of justifying terrible things i can say my society says its okay to oppress other people therefore its moral for me to do so see colonial europe if anything moral objectivity saves you from justifying horrible things you can claim all day long that oppression murder rape etc are moral but youd be wrong with moral relativism you cant avoid that especially with cases like the oft used example hitler where one could quite reasonably argue hitler was moral for murdering millions because his society approved of it if one accepts moral relativism so again your argument fails from the getgo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they seem to think traditional religion is the only source of morality and that its one end of a spectrum with moral decay on the other end
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you probably just have really good fundamentals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist progovernment multilateralist humanist progressive coming in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist authoritarian multilaterest humanist liberal over here does this mean i like people but i dont like freedom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist authoritarian multilateralist bleedingheart liberal interesting how they managed to determine my entire political belief system with only questions and managed to fit it in into only words s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist antigovernment multilateralist bleedingheart libertine reporting in hedonism for everyone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,socialist antigovernment isolationist humanist progressive for me does this make a lick of sense to anyone can a person even be socialist and antigovernment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah that pretty much proves this is where he got it from also we should nuke our enemies noninterventionist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did the same and got objectivist libertarian isolationist ultranationalist traditionalist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i put in the worst answers possible and got objectivist libertarian isolationist fundamentalist which can be conventionally be shortened down to donald trump or alternately ayn rand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,collectivism refers economic intervention whether the society or state should intervene in the economy to redistribute wealth from the more to the less successful i think theyre using the same screwy definitions of socialistcommunist as the pundits who use it to insult obama their axes are just weird in general though internationalism refers to political involvement in other nations or global affairs either via war treaty or international organizations i think i didnt get an internationalism word at all because my like of treaties somehow canceled out my dislike of wars
SubredditDrama,not_removed,leftleaning progovernment bleedingheart progressive here hey i only got things i feel cheated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same except without the authoritarian part ironically although i am a communist im not a communist by their definition so im also kind of at odds with the first part
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey i got almost exactly the same thing except apparently im just progovernment not authoritarian
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shit at least mine dont contradict each other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it refers to euthanasia as in old or terminally ill people being provided the means to end their life if they choose to not the nazi version the person who made that quiz seems to have some very peculiar views though so maybe im the one whos wrong either way lumping those three things into one question is pretty stupid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but i still answered it because even though theyre being lumped together stupidly i do think those things should all be legal true but if you get your definition from people who complain about the godless liberals undermining the fabric of society it is not unrestricted for euthanasia in particular need to make sure its a willing lucid decision and theres nobody who stands to gain by pressuring the person also i support giving medical attention and possibly protective custody to attempted suicides but i dont think we need the current weird legal footing of making it illegal in order to do that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think politics quizzes are almost more entertaining when theyre really bad its interesting to try to guess what results they want people to get this one sounds like an glenn beck or alex jones recruitment tool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,internationalism refers to political involvement in other nations or global affairs either via war treaty or international organizations i think they took the alex jones approach where the un counts as interventionist in the same way as the invasion of iraq
SubredditDrama,not_removed,here it seems to be the opposite of this guys ultranationalist presumably it means youre weakwilled enough to care about slavery even when it happens to foreigners
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what makes a man turn neautral a lust for power gold or were you just born with a heart full of neutrality
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay what you gonna do about it buddy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in my opinion the emperor is the one true go double heresy you dare compare our emperor to a filthy god exterminatus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i believe deadramones was saying how people on the internet often conflate those two views with each other in that people mean to say something like an expressivist view instead of moral subjectivismrelativism when they say morality is subjectiverelative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the two ideas definitely can go hand in hand but the important distinction is in what they are making claims about relativism makes a claim about the nature of moral fact what we can call right or wrong while expresivism makes a claim about the nature of human moral judgement and reasoning
SubredditDrama,not_removed,obligatory there are dozens of us but seriously how can someone read korsgaards selfconstitution or darwall and not think theyre at least some kind of realist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,often referring to folks like jean piaget this is funnier than you know piagets work has been applied to the field of moral development by lawrence kohlberg turns out when you do so you seem according to kohlberg to get a sort of kantian constructivism so the two terms are actually related in this fun manner
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but what is the point of those judgements what meaning does a statement like oppression is bad hold if believe that oppression isnt necessarily wrong when other people do it what meaning do judgments have at all to try and convince someone to act a different way usually what would change if i told you it was an objective moral imperative where did i derive that authority from what grounds do i have to claim its objective those values are gonna be subjective as well even when we use the word of a god to say its an objective judgment there are many who would say those words were misinterpreted my problem with claiming your idea is objective is that it then means youve convinced yourself theres no other way it cuts off conversation and understanding you can try to convince them its subjective because it always comes from somewhere even if they heard the word of god directly and see the value in your own ideals but thats a lot harder when you treat something as an absolute many people would tell you that there are inherently right answers to many moral questions because most people believe that there are absolute moral truths except divergence appears in situations actually involving nuance that demonstrate that these moral truths arent absolute two people might agree that killing is wrong but present them with a complicated scenario and they might get different answers because we might say killing or murder is wrong and say thats an absolute truth but we can easily come up with a scenario that shows it is not absolute at all for almost any given situation why cause its already completely accepted i guess if i really had to i could make a case for it but i dont think its at all necessary you can find all kinds of writing on the subject and ample justification for it i dont think i need to really sit here and create a case for it if you dont like it fine that doesnt mean its invalid or not taken seriously which is what you originally asked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mussolini actually said that fascism was the ultimate relativist doctrine since why would any country in it not look out for number one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my society says its okay to oppress other people therefore its moral for me to do so thats not moral relativism though if anything thats moral objectivism moral relativism doesnt say because you have morals that make it okay it is therefore moral at all it makes the case that there arent any absolute morals or rules and that people find morality from many different areas moral relativism is generally against the idea of dictating what acts are right or wrong it is more about recognizing that people can find things we might find amoral moral and many would extend that to say we should tolerate different moral practices as a result objectivism is what allows one to claim what is right or wrong morally and thats what my problem with moral objectivism it keeps people from trying to understand differing views when they can say mine is right because its derided from some authority you can claim all day long that oppression murder rape etc are moral but youd be wrong thats a pretty absolute and far reaching statement even on the more extreme end of normative moral relativists i think youd struggle to find people who advocate for such an idea so again your argument fails from the getgo if you cant talk about something that is inherently complex without making an absolute youre wrong from the start then theres really no point in discussing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you wouldnt be wrong claiming murder is moral if murder is objectively morally right though which sort of brings us back to square one in this utter shit debate of subjective vs objective morality
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if anything moral objectivity saves you from justifying horrible things the problem is in the interaction between moral philosophy and psychology people like to think of themselves as being and acting moral regardless of what their actions are so it leads to a line of thinking that goes i am good ergo my moral philosophy is good morality is an objectiveabsolute standard so ergo my moralityactions are absolutely universally good any criticisms or suggestions for improvement are written off as relativistic garbage even when ones morality is justifying horrible things so one justifies terrible things in the abstract setting while the other justifies them in the applied setting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,almost the same here and apparently i have tribalism whatever that even means
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist interventionist bleedingheart progressive master race equal of many different races checking in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist authoritarian multilateralist bleedingheart progressive apparently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uh excuse me but communist progovernment worldfederalist bleedingheart libertine is the only true ideology im going to need you to report the gulag of friendship for ideological retraining
SubredditDrama,not_removed,communist progovernment multilateralist bleedingheart libertine i think i have a heart condition
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wonder what the difference was for us since youre a multilateralist bleeding heart liberal and im an isolationist bleeding heart progressive i put maybe on quite a few questions because i was on the fence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can a person even be socialist and antigovernment httpsenwikipediaorgwikiagrariansocialism generally the places where this is tried devolve into a pseudofeudalist system pretty quickly with local regions dominated by charismaticviolent strongmen leaders
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anarchists would count as that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cant intervene if theres no people to intervene with i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well two ways to look at this either im very opinionated and have firm views on specific issues or im completely confused on the world you be the judge another one of those quizzes i took had me labeled as a centrist libertarian aligned with john mcafee
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ahhhhh i see yeah that quiz is garbage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im gonna claim that i beat you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tagging utomshoe for visibility youre right in your second point thats more or less what i was driving at people conflate subjective with relative with not real all the time the tricky part is that the term moral relativism doesnt track a particular theory the httpwwwieputmedumoralre which i highly recommend reading lists seven different claims that moral relativism could refer to its kind of confusing at base moral relativism is the claim that moral statements are only true in virtue of a particular standpoint now what the standpoint is and what you mean by true and also what your view on comparing standpoints is can radically alter the substance of the theory so cultural relativism which we can parse as moral views are only true or false from the perspective of any particular culture is a metaethical view because its a stance on moral facts in fact if you squint it actually looks more realist than anything else or at least quasirealist after all culture is a mind independent source of moral fact at least in a certain sense not a very defensible or robust realism but still there you can certainly derive a normative view from this metaethical claim like dont mess with other cultures but relativism in most forms that people talk about is chiefly metaethical the key to expressivism is actual a claim about language and beliefs namely noncognitivism its the claim that when i say murder is wrong that statement is neither true nor false when i say i like chocolate ice cream it cant be true or false in the same way that barack obama is the current us president is theres a trivial sense in that i could be lying but the purpose of i like chocolate ice cream is to report my mental state not say anything about the world expressivists claim moral statements are just like that so an expressivist claims that moral statments are not truthapt ie cant be true or false and the meaning of the statements are just reflections of the speakers mental state heres a fivedollar term for you this is called semantic ideation thus an expressivist is antirealist in that morality is just is a colleciton of mental statesattitudes about as minddependent as you get by contrast a moral relativist is commited to claiming that moral statments are truthapt just that what makes them true or false is contextual to keep with cultural relativism when someone says murder is wrong theres a definite fact about it the norms of the speakers particular culture and this in my view is the truly messed up part of strong cultural relativism on this view an abolitionist in alamaba was in fact making a grave moral error
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think ultimately it depends on how we conceive of things like reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im actually familiar with kohlberg as well and yeah his claimed final stage is reaching a kantian worldview ie universal ethical principles i enjoy studying the ways my field bleeds into others and vice versa as i think all of them have much to gain from one another but thanks for drawing that throughline for me i love this shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my problem with claiming your idea is objective is that it then means youve convinced yourself theres no other way it cuts off conversation and understanding not really tho for instance if someone believes the statement that life is generally preferable to death is an objective proof that doesnt in anyway cut off conversation and understanding
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you can never determine whats right or whats wrong then how can you criticize anyones actions on moral grounds for instance is there no moral value for the holocaust do we just say it was wrong because hitler wasted million good labourers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not moral relativism though if anything thats moral objectivism moral relativism doesnt say because you have morals that make it okay it is therefore moral at all it makes the case that there arent any absolute morals or rules and that people find morality from many different areas moral relativism is generally against the idea of dictating what acts are right or wrong it is more about recognizing that people can find things we might find amoral moral and many would extend that to say we should tolerate different moral practices as a result what i described is textbook moral relativism morality is relative to ones culture from that relativism inherently dictates that what is right and wrong is what ones culture says so people misinterpret relativism in that they think it implies tolerance and other virtues but it does not as my example shows objectivism is what allows one to claim what is right or wrong morally and thats what my problem with moral objectivism it keeps people from trying to understand differing views when they can say mine is right because its derided from some authority again relativism makes normative claims as well if you have a problem with a theory claiming that theres a right and wrong thats a problem with relativism as well and it could very well be a moral fact that being open to others ideas is morally good so again moral objectivity doesnt preclude what you want it to thats a pretty absolute and far reaching statement even on the more extreme end of normative moral relativists i think youd struggle to find people who advocate for such an idea its an extreme idea to say things like rape and murder are morally wrong sure there might be extremely unlikely overriding circumstances you can use to justify some cases like murdering one person to save humanity but those are so far fetched that i might as well say all cases if you cant talk about something that is inherently complex without making an absolute youre wrong from the start then theres really no point in discussing if you put forward an argument and i counter it successfully then your argument fails if you say and i say no it isnt and prove so then your argument fails to be somewhat honest im being quite dismissive of moral relativism for a few reasons one because ive already gone through intro to ethics and seen how absolutely dumb naive moral relativism is when applied to easy cases two because i dont want other people to become misinformed and end up on badphilosophy and three because i like debating actually decent theories like utilitarianism vs deontology where theres great arguments to be had for both sides unlike arguing against naive moral relativism which is boring and like shooting fish in a barrel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah cultural moral relativism is largely dead from the get go but the main takeway from all this should be that objective vs subjective is not only one of the most abused concepts on reddit its also one of the least productive ways to think about morality determing the criteria for objective is far trickier than first appears the speed of light is x ms and barack obama is the current us president are both clearly facts but the sense in which they are objective is radically different
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes but then you have to explain why we all have this massive misconception that murder is bad when its really good it seems fairly ubiquitous among humans that murder is usually a pretty bad thing so why did we gain this misconception if murder is actually good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is my experience purely but i dont often see that more often than not people are really receptive in listening to what your reasoning is and dont believe themselves to be the allknower of what is moral and just are there those closed minded fools sure but they seem to be a very small minority
SubredditDrama,not_removed,negative percentages indicate opposition to national or ethnic identity and oriented towards panhumanism youre basically a culture citizen now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for me i am a communist interventionist humanist liberal i apparently got that for having a collectivism score while having a authoritarian score with a in both the liberalism and internationalism categories
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im curious too maybe the euthanasiaabortionsuicide question how do you feel on questions while were at it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think they just have five separate axes that dont interact but use inappropriately sweeping adjectives to describe them liberal probably just means you said you didnt want to make the commandments into laws or whatever that question was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aligned with john mcafee you should be proud john mcafee is a beast made of magic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im gonna claim you lied then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in fact if you squint it actually looks more realist than anything else or at least quasirealist after all culture is a mind independent source of moral fact at least in a certain sense i have to disagree with you a bit here its mindindependent if you take it in the this group agrees but if person was gone the fact the group agrees would continue sort of way i interpret mindindependent as a stronger even if there were no humans or at least no humans who believed it it would still be fact like how is correct regardless if anyone existed or believed it otherwise ill defer to you im just starting grad school so my education is less extensive than yours in this area though i wasnt taught that moral relativism was an actual metaethical theory just simply a normative one the more you know star shoots by
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh expressivism kind of seems to be a roundabout way of getting to what most people understand evidently incorrectly as moral relativism to me the salient takeaway from expressivism as you described it is the implication that morality is subjective and not an inherent aspect of reality that seems perfectly reasonable does anyone even argue this point but im not sure why its necessary to arrive at that point via semantic ideation surely the idea that moral statements are simply a reflection of the speakers mental state would stem from the subjectivity of morality not the other way around
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you dont think if someone believes their cause is objectively right they might be less receptive to ideas that go contrary to it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you can never determine whats right or whats wrong then how can you criticize anyones actions on moral grounds ill turn the question around on you do you need to know youre right objectively and unquestionably in order to say something else is wrong for instance is there no moral value for the holocaust do we just say it was wrong because hitler wasted million good labourers course not he is responsible for killion million people and decimating populations on a completely flawed basis that stemmed from fear the systemic killing of millions should bother you for personal reasons values beliefs and opinions that are yours regardless of whether or not theyre objectively right but one should also consider and understand why this happened the kind of trap the german people ended up in and how easily people slip into something horrific its not because they were wrong and we were right what does that tell us nothing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what i described is textbook moral relativism what textbook httpwwwieputmedumoralre httpsenwikipediaorgwikimoralrelativism from that relativism inherently dictates that what is right and wrong is what ones culture says so people misinterpret relativism in that they think it implies tolerance and other virtues but it does not as my example shows what your example was taking the idea to its furthest extreme and drawing incorrect conclusions about how most at least moral relativists might treat it again relativism makes normative claims as well but it doesnt try to make statements about which morals are objectively right it teaches that there are disagreements about morals and these values often have legitimate background much like our own many also think that for this reason tolerance should be given to differing values which clashes with the idea of objective moralism which teaches intolerance of differing values its an extreme idea to say things like rape and murder are morally wrong not what i said if you put forward an argument and i counter it successfully then your argument fails are you actually serious this isnt an rpg and boy the arrogance here where theres great arguments to be had for both sides unlike arguing against naive moral relativism which is boring and like shooting fish in a barrel maybe if you dont actually know what it is cause its only been a subject of debate since ancient greece if you wanna post this whole thing to badphilosophy go ahead please link me it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean the definition of murder have changed all through out history a good example was that it was deemed alright to kill your newborns in rome would most definitely constitute as murder in pretty much every country on earth today and be morally wrong though a mother killing her newborn is often deemed less morally wrong than for the father to kill his newborn baby i guess you could argue that its objectively wrong as of right now but that just seem obnoxious and is basically saying the same thing as morals are subjective
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yea im totally a human supremascist those bloody aliens should be crushed under the boot of a united humanity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for the euthanasia one i put yes yes no no mainly because after being in the military i think we involve ourselves in way too many fights and cause more problems than we solve isis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds that way i dont feel a religion should be set in laws but the morals behind them arent bad i mean not killing each other seems to be one of those things all most religions can agree on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im going to claim myself on my taxes then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think at least in metaethics there is a certain amount of debate about mindindepenence going back to barack obama is the current us president thats at least to my view a mindindependent fact but it certainly wouldnt be true if humans had never existed or if the earth had blown up in i think taking into account social structures or human behaviour is a perfectly acceptable thing to do while talking about moral facts but that could just be my constructivist bias showing i wasnt taught that moral relativism was an actual metaethical theory just simply a normative one i think the way most people talk about relativism if at all in actual philosophy classes its david wongs normative one so youre right there but if you look at a writer like harman you can see the metaethical view more pointedly and what im trying to drive at above is that the normative theory has to make metaethical claims to make any sense a normative moral relativism just cant fit with either a more robust realism or antirealist theories like expressivism i suppose it could work with fictionalism though good luck in grad school what are you studying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah youre pretty much on target i think antirealism in general captures the intuitions that drive people to talk about moral relativism but in a much more precise way one of the major issues when talking casually about philosophy is when people talk past each other you can see it in this very thread when some people say moral relativism they mean subjective morals while others mean cultural relativism while others mean some kind of nihlism its really really important to nail down exactly what we mean before trying to talk about it otherwise discussion is going to be fruitless and frustrating relativism just isnt a precise enough concept to be worth arguing over the point about semanic ideation is the cognitivist question the realism debate is really two questions what are moral facts and how does moral language work expressivists agree broadly with other antirealists about but disagree with them about so you can be an antirealist but still think moral statements are truth apt error theorists for instance argue that murder is wrong is analogous to phlogiston is released during combustion so truthapt but always wrong expressivists go further but about language not the state of moral facts they agree with other antirealists that moral facts are minddependent but they also think moral language are just straightforward expressions of attitudes rather than statements about the world that seems perfectly reasonable does anyone even argue this point there was a survey of professional philosophers a while back on philpapers and they showed that about half of philosophers currently in the field are moral realists if you add constructivists quasirealists to that number it pushes so dont think the issue is settled especially considering amongst people who think about this for a living antirealists are in the miniority httpwwwieputmedumoralrea would be useful especially sections b and c
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in some cases yes in other cases no it depends on the belief
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill turn the question around on you do you need to know youre right objectively and unquestionably in order to say something else is wrong so are you saying you are capable of criticising another moral framework based on subjective morality alone course not he is responsible for killion million people and decimating populations on a completely flawed basis that stemmed from fear but under moral relativism hitler could just respond decimating the jews is morally right according to me what response do you have to this if you cannot make objective statements about morality the systemic killing of millions should bother you for personal reasons values beliefs and opinions that are yours regardless of whether or not theyre objectively right so there are values beliefs and opinions i should hold that make the holocaust subjectively wrong but if i dont hold those then i could say the holocaust was right should these values beliefs and opinions be held by everyone that is a rational and moral human being doesnt that give us an objective framework for morality
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wikipedias shit for philosophy sep instead
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what textbook httpwwwieputmedumoralre httpsenwikipediaorgwikimoralrelativism from the first moral relativism is the view that moral judgments are true or false only relative to some particular standpoint for instance that of a culture or a historical period and that no standpoint is uniquely privileged over all others from the second descriptive moral relativism holds only that some people do in fact disagree about what is moral metaethical moral relativism holds that in such disagreements nobody is objectively right or wrong and normative moral relativism holds that because nobody is right or wrong we ought to tolerate the behavior of others even when we disagree about the morality of it btw never trust wikipedia as a source on philosophy because its usually edited by philosophically ignorant people it shows on the last line in that moral relativism doesnt imply tolerance in the slightest but wikipedia says it does what your example was taking the idea to its furthest extreme and drawing incorrect conclusions about how most at least moral relativists might treat it my example was saying that under moral relativism you can easily make the judgment that oppression is moral and so moral relativism doesnt escape justifying oppression like you thought moral objectivism did but it doesnt try to make statements about which morals are objectively right it teaches that there are disagreements about morals and these values often have legitimate background much like our own many also think that for this reason tolerance should be given to differing values which clashes with the idea of objective moralism which teaches intolerance of differing values yes it quite does morality being dictated by your culture is literally the core tenant of moral relativism youre attaching things to moral relativism that it doesnt have as again my example shows i can quite easily be an arrogant douchebag and oppress other cultures because my culture approves of such a thing not what i said it is when you accept moral relativism because relativism cant say its always morally wrong like we want morality to say are you actually serious this isnt an rpg and boy the arrogance here im being arrogant because i have studied and am studying ethical theory and this stuff is literally debunked in every intro to ethics class so it shows you have no knowledge about the subject matter theres a reason moral relativism isnt a very widely accepted view in academia and those who do profess it usually have to have very complex systems to get out of even just some of the problems mr has maybe if you dont actually know what it is cause its only been a subject of debate since ancient greece if you wanna post this whole thing to badphilosophy go ahead please link me it im sure someone else will stumble upon this and post it and since ancient greece the most widely accepted view has been some form of moral objectivity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what constitutes murder might change depending on your culture sure but if one does commit what constitutes murder its often a morally very bad thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,death to the idirans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no maybe maybe yes i think that answers that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah they seemed to think that theres a scale between traditional morality and hedonism but i think thats a false dichotomy because you can still have morals without religion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats at least to my view a mindindependent fact but it certainly wouldnt be true if humans had never existed or if the earth had blown up in yeah im not entirely sold one way or the other on that one on the one hand if noone believed barack obama was the current president then it would be the case that he was not the president wouldnt it so it seems like its mind dependent in that sense on the other hand it seems like a lot of people can disagree he is president but the idea of the president can admit a bit of tolerance and doesnt completely fall apart because someone doesnt accept obama as president so its mind independent another way i sort of lean in the direction of minddependent though good luck in grad school what are you studying thank you mostly normative and metaethical theory i find questions about oughts to be interesting and engaging why ought i dothink x seems infinitely more intriguing to me than straight is x theory or y theory correct
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so how could one believe that morality is mind dependent yet also believe that moral statements reflect anything other than the speakers mind also — unless im totally misunderstanding constructivism — wouldnt it be pretty much compatible with antirealism it seems to be the notion similar to constructivism in the social sciences that morals are mentally or socially constructed if thats so does that not more or less fall in line with the antirealist notion that morals are subjective rather than grounded in reality i mean perhaps you dont get the same nihilistic implications you could interpret from antirealism but apart from that the differences seem relatively minor in any case i dont really understand what the metaethical case for realism is beyond this seems bad but antirealism says it isnt necessarily
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but if i dont hold those then i could say the holocaust was right nobodys stopping you technically and there are those who do i think theyre absolutely fucked up for doing it and disagree entirely but under moral relativism hitler could just respond decimating the jews is morally right according to me what response do you have to this if you cannot make objective statements about morality he could just as easily say its objectively right would that change anything maybe the tone of the debate so are you saying you are capable of criticising another moral framework based on subjective morality alone id hope so objectivism is a real crutch asserting that you know the truth and what is right id need to be omniscient for that or be able to delude myself into thinking i can truly tell what is really right from wrong morals to me mean something because i believe we should treat people how they want to be treated within reason of course because i desire the same treatment from others its not objective or absolute but i think its agreeable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpplatostanfordeduentriesmoralrelativism most often it is associated with an empirical thesis that there are deep and widespread moral disagreements and a metaethical thesis that the truth or justification of moral judgments is not absolute but relative to the moral standard of some person or group of persons sometimes moral relativism is connected with a normative position about how we ought to think about or act towards those with whom we morally disagree most commonly that we should tolerate them i think thats agreeable with how ive been using the term
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from the first yeah and youre taking that idea that moral judgments being true or false relative to the particular standpoint to the extreme your example is not accurate of the subject its just an extremist interpretation that ignores nuance and seems to miss the point entirely it shows on the last line in that moral relativism doesnt imply tolerance in the slightest but wikipedia says it does you know just because you say so doesnt make it a fact id say that teaching people to consider others views on their morals and that yours arent inherently better than theirs is in many ways teaching tolerance it means you cant just dismiss anothers views offhand because they disagree with your own yes it quite does youre saying that moral relativism tries to say what morals are objectively right if anything shows you seem to have a warped idea of what moral relativism is this should that quite literally goes against the basic tenets my example shows i can quite easily be an arrogant douchebag and oppress other cultures because my culture approves of such a thing doesnt mean everyone will see it as right or that it is objectively right to do so and even within your own culture a lot of people would say youre being a dickhead im being arrogant because i have studied and am studying ethical theory and this stuff is literally debunked in every intro to ethics class so it shows you have no knowledge about the subject matter theres a reason moral relativism isnt a very widely accepted view in academia and those who do profess it usually have to have very complex systems to get out of even just some of the problems mr has i think youre full of it people who understand a subject arent so outright arrogant of it as if theyre trying to prove something they discuss they dont lecture even those whose job it is to lecture shouldnt talk down to people theres clearly an ongoing discussion on the subject to say its been debunked shows a fundamental misunderstanding and so long as you keep insisting youre right that misunderstanding cant be breached
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so if im understanding you right youre saying if killing someone is murder its objectively morally wrong because thats a prime example of why this entire discussion is retarded people are basically saying the same thing with different words and talking about different things while thinking theyre arguing about the same thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but if one does commit what constitutes murder its often a morally very bad thing but not always you realize thats what moral relativism says
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it seems to be the notion similar to constructivism in the social sciences that morals are mentally or socially constructed ideally constructed so the idea is that if you have a perfectly rational being thats perfectly informed maybe a few other criteria like a veil of ignorance theyd set out judgements for how to act how the world should be like etc and theyd be whats moral there is no actual person or culture doing this thing its abstracted away past any particular culture or person or species in any case i dont really understand what the metaethical case for realism is beyond this seems bad but antirealism says it isnt necessarily so there are a variety my friend nicole has posted a good few on rphilosophy over the past few years one can be found theres heumers ontological argument but my favorite is this one most famously put by terence cuneo moral facts are facts about moral normativity epistemic facts are facts about epistemic normativity moral and epistemic normativity are not different in kind thus moral and epistemic facts are not different in kind thus objections to moral facts that succeed would succeed against epistemic facts but those objections dont succeed against epistemic facts thus the objections to moral facts must fail the two real ways to escape this argument is to deny that moral facts and epistemic facts are similar to show specific ways in which your objections target morality and not epistemology but this is near impossible to do since the standard objections target both the second is to bite the bullet and accept epistemic antirealism but this is a horrible bullet to bite
SubredditDrama,not_removed,moral and epistemic normativity are very different in kind epistemic norms yield tentative truths that can be empirically tested what truths do moral norms yield and whatever your answer how are they empirically tested
SubredditDrama,not_removed,epistemic norms yield tentative truths that can be empirically tested what do you know what an epistemic norm is an epistemic norm is a claim about what one should believe that aint empirically testable or tentative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a postdoc in the philosophy department at fordham university my areas of specialization are metaphysics and medieval philosophy do you know what an epistemic norm is and since the answer is no you dont even understand the argument you made no wonder you dont see it is shite edit httpplatostanfordeduentriesethicsbelief replace norms with beliefs and see if that makes any sense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a norm is something you should obey now lets not just go with some person on stackexchange that doesnt even specialize in the field though they happen to actually agree with me lets go to say where they say some epistemologists most notably internalists like pollock hold that the norms have to do with epistemic responsibility in a way that is analogous to norms governing moral responsibility one might say for example that a belief is warranted insofar as it is epistemically permissible to hold the belief given some set of standards for permissible belief shit or hey we can look at a seminar in httpcanbaskentnetlogictalksnormstalkpdf epistemic norms are those norms which describe if it is epistemically permissible to hold various beliefs well fuck replace norms with beliefs and see if that makes any sense errr what the fuck is that unrelated article supposed to show
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a norm is something you should do or not do not believe we use epistemic norms to acquire beliefs moral norms are also what we should or shouldnt do but for different reasons the point i was leading towards eventually this is no doubt the source of your confused argument dont murder is not something we should believe it is a rule we should follow edit its not even a proposition epistemic norms are those norms which describe if it is epistemically permissible to hold various beliefs replacing norms with beliefs you get epistemic norms are those beliefs which describe if it is epistemically permissible to hold various beliefs your quote is poorly written under your meaning or mine but the most charitable interpretation would be along the lines of epistemic norms are those norms which describe what rules to follow to acquire various correct beliefs but this is a distraction give an example of an epistemic norm using your meaning and a moral norm using your meaning and lets see how similar they are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,moral norms are also what we should or shouldnt do but for different reasons thats nice please support your bullshit claims replacing norms with beliefs you get why should we the two are completely unrelated why do you keep trying to switch norms and beliefs they arent the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why should we the two are completely unrelated why do you keep trying to switch norms and beliefs they arent the same because no see my last answer dont murder isnt a claim about what we should believe its a rule we should follow reyour other quote some epistemologists most notably internalists like pollock hold that the norms have to do with epistemic responsibility in a way that is analogous to norms governing moral responsibility one might say for example that a belief is warranted insofar as it is epistemically permissible to hold the belief given some set of standards for permissible belief permissible is a moral concept it is permissible to believe anything it is not permissible to murder or at least thats one normative claim i think the author was making an analogy i hope so anyway likewise with epistemic responsibility taken literally its just silly this hasnt gone the way i planned we have gotten distracted by a side point and it doesnt look like we will move beyond it it doesnt look like i am going to get to show you how epistemic and moral norms are different oh well thanks for your time anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont murder isnt a claim about what we should believe its a rule we should follow its a claim about what we should do or rather its the imperative form of it is wrong to murder which is a claim about what we should do permissible is a moral concept no its not its a normative concept there are senses in which things are permissible but not moral eg legal normativity or epistemic normativity its not silly youre just blatantly wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a side note i almost never recommend this site to non users because if you dont know how to avoid the trash this site is awful so true it took me probably a full year to get the hang of this website heck theres still a bit of a learning curve every day new abbreviations circlejerks and metahumor are popping into existence always
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i remember the drama back in may may june a couple of years ago and i thought that would be the tip of the default mod dramas looks like i was wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,guys weve gone too far down the rabbit hole i think we need to unplug the internet and plug it back in and then see if that works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the issue is that when thedonald goes into other subreddits theyre not sending their best theyre sending death threats doxxing and harassment holy shit my fucking sides
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus christ theyve completely taken over rself over that thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,first things first if you have not watched a gay man aggressively defend trump supporters please watch this video spoiler alert the video is about milo a gay man who hates gay people and thinks it would be better if they just stayed in the closet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is this the thread thats staying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rself is a mess with all the brigaiding going on right now i was thinking about posting something there about flexitarianism but now i think ill just wait on that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good times when we didnt have td drama on this website
SubredditDrama,not_removed,banning rthedonald would be a step beyond banning rfatpeoplehate which itself was a step beyond banning rcoontown it also feels like shutting the barn door after the horse has bolted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought trumps election might at least be the end of their pathetic fucking victim narrative color me naive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,something i wrote in that response thread that seems fine at first glance denouncing racism right no problem take a look at the comments there are people with upvotes defending literal white nationalism and thats only the people being blatant just about every top comment is attacking diversity and saying that ethnonationalists are totally not racists you guys shit like that remains on the sub while if you mock trumps hair you get banned permanently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the internet kiddo why are you so thin skinned you guys called spez a pedophile over some edited comments ooh downvotes despite powermods openly calling for the execution of trump and all his supporters i have no life outside reddit therefore being having one account banned will destroy it the comparison isnt who is involved thats not important td refugees have been at the center of a number of terrorist attacks hate crimes and violence in various countries we want em all out im assuming youd take problem to kicking them all out yes people in this thread a small number of td users are being assholes over the internet we want to ban them all from reddit and end their sub these do seem like comparable moral arguments yes kicking out refugees to face probable death is quite similar to closing one subforum ban rpedofriends first and foremost these people get it but seriously reddit you need to start banning subs before they become a problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah yes the whole im totally for free speech but its almost as if his pandered response completely ignores the fact that free speech does not extend to privately owned websites or communities so even bringing up the idea is idiotic just look at the default front page and see the absence of free speech lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think that subreddit is absolute nonsense and that td will probably get the axe eventually but if thats gonna happen id argue that it happen sooner rather than later reddit isnt and never has been the bastion of free speech people assume it is and the sooner thats made clear to everyone the better off well be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the donald doesnt understand that they are ruining reddit with their shitposts its hard to ignore them when they are like a loud annoying child screaming at the top of their lungs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gifs of dead cats are criticism now sorry can someone explain this bit to me please i mustve missed it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cannot wait for trump and republicans to start going after net neutrality that is the one thing that will make them lose their shit because women rights dont affect them minority rights dont affect them lgbt rights dont affect them but destroying net neutrality definitely will
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not a one of these people cared when rsandersforpresident was taking up the entire front page of rall theyre right was everywhere but td is breaking rules did not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,admins lost any chance of neutering the subreddit now theyre targetting the establishment and harassing people wonder which breaks first the admins the defaults or thedonald
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont pay too much attention to reddit rall and as a canadian i only casually followed the us election i always thought thedonald was a troll sub by is it not ive never contemplated the seriousness of that subbut now im not so sure anymore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tldr td users doxxed me and threatened to kill my dog stop being such a little bitch about it forget justification as a case by case issue id be happy to see that sub go just because most the people who leak out of it are edgelords and assholes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,political standing aside that tyler the creator tweet is one of my favorite tweets of all time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sometimes i love posts like these because the comments on the linked posts give me the opportunity to tag all the users i should probably not bother interacting with in the future
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if thats not an admin ill eat my hat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the top comments i thought were disagreeing with op
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lmao the fuck is going on this year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel genuinely bad for these people that have nothing better to do in their life than to sit on reddit and literally cry about ctr all day lmao
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love that theyre still so mad that politics isnt trump propaganda that they feign false equivalence no one is being banned from politics for opinions theyre banned for posting factually false things and conspiracy theories that are not based in reality purge the donald and all of its users if they really do care about their community they will leave and go make their own website this is how you know their threats are hollow their intent is to have their own safe space troll anyone who disagrees with them and spread out to other subreddits by nimbly navigating the fact that they werent all purged months ago is the biggest embarrassment the reddit admins will ever face in their lives as professionals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i usually vote for right wing parties but ive always been extremely supportive of lgbt rights rthedonald makes me very proud of where america is on this issue id say of people there are supportive of gay marriage trump holding up the rainbow flag gets upvotes all the time this has actually left me dumbfounded first off vote bots and the actual people just blindly upvoting everything help explain the upvotes which isnt even getting into the fact that upvoting a post being supportive of lgbt rights second off lol get fucking real maybe that many might tolerate it which i also doubt but its delusional to think there were that many people actually supportive of lgbt rights on rtd i would bet a large sum of money that nearly none of them have ever done anything to personally fight for lgbt rights
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it pisses me off that reddit still claims its the front page of the internet when most of its viewership seems skewed so hard away from truth science and actual thought reddit has gotten used to being huge and they need to do something to curb the issue of people using he site to force their movements down everyones throats there was a lot of talk about how stormfront used to use sites like this to recruit when o first joined and reddit seems to have never addressed this td seemed to cheat their way up to the top of all over and over and no one wanted to address that this place is just the wild west when it comes to any kind of integrity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly though id be pretty happy if i didnt have to see td anymore its the circlejerks to end all circlejerks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,using res and my mobile app to completely remove as many of the politicallycharged subreddits as i could has immensely improved my reddit experience i miss out on some drama here and there but thats worth it to actually be seeing subs and posts i want to see rather than picking them out among the garbage that is most defaults
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if fph was banned for brigading then td absolutely should be too theyre worse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those were some cherry picked lines to make it seem like everyone was on one side of this argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im biding my time waiting for trumps administration to kill net neutrality and the fcc itll be fun to see the idiotic excuses td makes for donald and his crew itll be even funnier if all of them turn against trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont really know if was sarcasm or not but if not the lack of selfawareness is baffling to say the least
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant help but feel that maybe everyone is just being a bit of a cunt and maybe we all just need to simmer down a little bit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the is so greasy too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also my problem with td isnt the racism if it is even there my problem is the doxxing the brigading the harassment and the vote manipulation a most reddit of problems real world issues meh fake internet points and reddit decorum serious business
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude cross posted his own post to enoughtrumpspam then deleted it when it was found so his altruism about getting rid of it is kind of bunk even the commentators there called it out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is so easy to make poor people mad at each other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they should just ban the sub there are plenty of transgressions to cite
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thedonald is an echo chamber just as awful as any of the others on this aggregater i was banned from all for making an opposing point to what a demagogue known to be a slime covered bag of shit has said whether or not the opposition candidates were generally in my wheelhouse i could never nor will ever look back on this moment in history with pride perhaps this will not be the worst thing to happen in my life time however we can only pray that it will be i am with dr hawking on this one i want to get off this planet and go to another one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can someone please explain to me what the hell brigading actually means to you people i always thought it was posting a link to a thread or post and calling for people to spam them or downvoteupvote them nothing ive seen thats been getting called brigading in this thread fits that description as far as im concerned the fact of the matter is that trump subreddit is one of the most active on the site of fucking course when a post hits the front page calling for their subreddit to be removed a lot of them are gonna see it and respond what are they meant to do ignore it why cant their detractors just ignore their subreddit then im called a brigaded or told im concern trolling id really appreciate a nice thought out non insulting answer to this edit apologies for shitty grammar im typing this on an ipad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tanker truck full of liquid butter backs up to srd the popcorn is popping at critical mass
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a pretty short post to be called an essay maybe if i was in middle school
SubredditDrama,not_removed,baconreader allows users to filter out entire subreddits it doesnt solve the problem of brigading but it cleans up the front page
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know what all this drama is about because i blocked td as soon as i saw all the negative shitposting if for what ever reason i feel the need to go there i just go there by typing in the address
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people really think that srs brigades
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean hes not wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the best idea ive heard is that the mods should just remove their ability to ban people and unban everyone take away their safe space and actually give them unfettered free speech
SubredditDrama,not_removed,res is getting a workout with all these tags im getting to add tonight i mean this was all a trap to get td true believers to show up and invade the comments section right makes it easy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reddit has million unique visitors a month thederp has what thousand users that is of the user base but they create a large share of the problems in terms of spamming the front page and these huge controversies probably the vast silent majority of reddit users have no idea that td even is or whats going on as like me they just never see rall just their own front page im not taking a stand on thederp either way but they really arent as popular as they act like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,op doesnt come of great in that thread imo xposts thread to renoughtrumpspam posts an edited convo to support their point and barely responds to criticism that being said both sides are upvoted somewhat evenly turns out that reddit is pretty split on the issue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont you guys use res or use reddit filters how hard is that to do if you never want to see a post about thedonald my goodness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that entire thread was absolutely beautiful op got completely destroyed and because the opinions didnt go his way he reposted the same thread in ets the salt and butthurt are out of this world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you know i always come back to the thought why cant we be nice to each other what is it about humanity that causes us to utilize the anonymity of the internet to be total bucketwads to each other what is so rotten at our core that we as a species are capable of such vitriolic actions and cruelty i dont get it i dont know you people but even here on reddit where i am literally a nobody i dont have a desire to call any of you mean names or be a douchehat to any of you why would i oh we dont agree on politics or we are having an argument and you are trying to explain something to me that i just dont understand so you start to call me names what is the point of that and why would i react in equally cruel measures when you are just another person like me and a stranger why would i exert the energy to be an asshole to you just because you are one to me i know it is naive of me but i just dont get it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,imagine being so pathetic you actively care about a place on the internet so much you start a meme war like this is all you got going for you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all these bernie sanders themed accounts crying about the other side clogging the front page its delicious irony
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id just like to thank uspez for crapifying my front page with td crap after doing all i can to keep this bullshit out of my sight good job man s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,apologies for posting this here but i am unsure where else i should post my question i am a relatively inexperienced redditor as i have only been using the site consistently for the past few months despite having an account for years so please forgive my ignorance i saw a comment in the linked thread about being able to hide subs with the reddit enhancement suite but i primarily browse reddit on my phone is there something available that would enable me to permanently hide subs either in the reddit app or reddit mobile i enjoy most browsing rall but there are several subs that consistently show up there that i would like to permanently hide if possible because its really ruining the experience for me i dont want to mention which ones can anyone direct me to such a thing if it exists i dont enjoy using reddit desktop on my phone so that is not an option for me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i originally saw this i thought it said it was in rsubredditsimulator and was shocked how well the post was worded and how accurate the links were the awe even extended to reading the top comment but then the skeptic kicked in and i had to confirm i was almost sad when i realized it wasnt rsubredditsimulator oh well i guess were safe from robot overlords for another week or two at least
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reddit right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there really should be no default subreddits they should make you take a quick tour or quiz to determine what your defaults should be do you like pictures of kewt cats do you feel like women reject you because youre too much of a man do you hate the us oligarchy and think bernie was robbed do you have a sense of endless superiority and also love drama do you think carl sagan is the new lord and savior
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe this is why my younger cousin browses imgur comments yes you heard that right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,has anyone found out if theres a way to stop certain subs from showing up in my rall feed like a filter of some kind edit i got it res
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i created an alt account just the other week for reasons and finding out how to unsubscribe from pretty much every default was a hassle i dont know how i didnt turn around at the door when i first joined
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im actually ashamed to reveal i still use this website to friends who dumped it when it became the cesspool it currently is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nearly half of rall is comprised of posts by the same powerusers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man when i joined five years ago all i had to worry about was who unidan was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt really have an issue with it to start i joined for rgravityfalls before moving over to rpokemon and have been bouncing around political and fandom subs ever since subbing to routoftheloop helps ensure that any new memes or major site events end up on my front page which helps keep me in the loop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in all ideal world all the trash could be trash on voat or whatever maybe someday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i remember when socrates died for this shit was the stupidest thing id ever seen on srd oh those glorious days what i wouldnt give for another undefaulting of atheism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,two clicks for memes is fascism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,may may june was a couple years ago holy shit how much of my waking hours have i lost on this site
SubredditDrama,not_removed,directions unclear you are now a moderator at rpyongyang
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can we unplug reality
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sure some of them are good people too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hadnt noticed the joke until i read your comment now im in tears
SubredditDrama,not_removed,be accused of brigading in other subreddits defend self by brigading in other subreddits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre spamming the subreddit like crazy but are mad that the mods had it set to private for a short time like you cant really figure out why they would do that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have been assured that td never brigades s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus fuck what was that about brigading and srs this alone should be grounds for a hard ban
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trying and failing to do the same in here too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i got on that thread and saw a bunch of comments overwhelmingly agreeing with the op i come back now and td has taken it over they are like a plague
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and they wonder why so many other people who frequent reddit just want them all to go away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus christ theyve completely taken over rself over that thread their cult head is egotistical beyond belief makes sense his followers would be too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on rthewilders a subreddit about geert wilders and his party for freedom partij voor de vrijheid pvv this is not a parody sub we fully endorse and support pvv and their message if you need to say this is not a parody when discussing your political views you should maybe consider rethinking your political views
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rconspiracy isnt fun anymore its just filled with pizza gate shit and if you disagree you get called a shill i tried to explain that today but no one ever actually reads what you write they just yell at you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah the canada subreddit has really been impacted over the last year or so i think theyre definitely like a second fph and like fph i have a feeling most people wouldnt be sad to see them go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,milo yannnipoaspdfsdof or whatever has literally been quoted as saying he became gay to piss off his parents a lot of selfinduced homophobia in there hes a really nasty guy to watch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes a boring troll so far he has never said anything of worth in his entire life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpswwwtwittercomnero
SubredditDrama,not_removed,guess so god damn mods ruining my chance at karma whoring
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all the while in the thread are people saying we dont brigade while the whole thread is being brigaded its absolutely ridiculous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow that is some amazing brigading over there you werent kidding i give it another week tops something has to give guess well see if its the mods or the admins that snap first
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously report this stuff to the admins if ive learned one thing by constantly pestering them its that they dont have their finger on the pulse of this website its pretty much whatever the opposite of that is actually they seem incredibly insulated to the actual user experience until you tell them about it rub thier faces in it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i want to hear about flexitarianism lay it on me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wwwredditcomrselfnew oh man you werent kidding
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well we used to have fatpeoplehate and reuropean and others like them the site never gets more than a few months to breathe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres still horses in the barn though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you have to start some time and you have to start some where yes its late to get started and yes it will be playing wackamole if they spread into other subs or create new ones but if you dont get started then other regulars will eventually tire of this shit and move on right now im still blocking certain subs and users but eventually ill tire of this as will others and move onto a new online community that doesnt have this kind of bs last point if fhey didnt brigade subs like they are doing in rself as i type this or use lots of proxy subs it wouldnt be such a big deal but that isnt how they operate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man thats some gross imagery right there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youll note that he used an alt that is not connected to him to make the post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe buddy is martyring himself so they finally get rid of td
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats never going to happen they want to feel like plucky underdogs ideas like your guy won and the republicans control every branch of the government are not going to get in the way of that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,playing victim is racist wrote an entire research paper comparing the klans self victimization they portrayed in their self published newspapers vs the interpretation of the same events in standard media seeing the new form of popular racism go through with the same tactics is unsurprising when reality doesnt fit your narrative attempt to discredit reality
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had to stop reading the thread once td users started comparing their struggle on reddit to the struggle of actual refugees
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre crybullies this is all they do shit on everything they can ruin the fun for everyone else and once they finally face any hitback its the worst injustice ever and the person responsible faces the full force of their anger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyll always have george soros to cling to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump supporters always need to paint themselves as victims of something otherwise the conversation turns to them and their ideasand it doesnt usually go well for them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im convinced that its just like a halfdozen russian guys trying to tie reddit in knots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah just wanting my whole country to be white isnt racist right so what happens to people who were born here but arent white do we only throw out people of other skin colors or other nationalities like poles or czech as well what im asking is assuming someone like that got power in say austria what they would want to do is single out everyone who isnt a purebred austrian is this like turned up to we sort out anyone we find to be less than a certain percentage austrian ℅ how much and where do we put them just set them down outside our borders do we put them to work in camps while they wait for the train out clever use of already existing camps right there what about a married couple do we throw out the white partner too or only their spouse do we throw out that american staying with us or is he okay because hes white what about the black american you know what i dont even want an answer those people are ridiculous and im sick to death of stumbling over them on reddit constantly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i suppose to people who have nothing else going on in their lives or parts of their identity to be proud of losing some specific reddit account or subreddit is equivalent to that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these brigadees just gave me cancer and ive never wished to punch somebody as hard as now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,without them brigading any thread that mentions them yep they are hard at work in here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the concept of free speech is cultural as well as constitutional the legal requirements may be missing on a private site but people can still hold it up as an ideal in fact when it suited them reddits founders have done exactly that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,heres the problem donald trump had an ama there he wont stand for it hell make a stupid tweet about and create a massive mainstream shitstorm by having the president of the united states endorse a subreddit reddit is in a loselose scenario td spreads and ruins the site slowly or backlash from a ban that will hit msm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the donald doesnt understand that they are ruining reddit with their shitposts im pretty sure they do and they like it remember a few hours after trump won the election rthedinner made a post about how we should suck their cocks thats what we are dealing with here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they understand they even brag about all the shitposting in that thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not that they dont understand its that they dont care nor do tds mods they see it as they won and everyone else lost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trying to turn reddit into basically lots of faux outrage over supposed freespeech suppression and biased whatevers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thed is like everyones shitty little brother who wont stop annoying you until you kick him in the nuts and then he cries for mom and the waterworks start you probably shouldnt have hit him but he fuckin deserved it my take on the uspez situation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean the front page is either gonna be the donald or more stupid ass adviceanimals and rpics posts that dont make sense without a paragraph title its not like much will change the front page was always garbo and made reddit look stupid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its hard to ignore them i blocked them in res months ago both on my front page and in my rall but i can almost guarantee that if i hadnt i wouldnt be on reddit nearly as much as i usually am
SubredditDrama,not_removed,essentially mods that i know were sent gifs of dead cats and gifs of other dead animals after the slack leaks the responses shrugged it off as criticism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyll find some way to defend it theyll probably even say its better for them or something like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wont take that long the new attorney general wants to get rid of weed laws and most of td seems to think thats safe under trump for whatever bizarre reason even though trump himself has never supported recreational marijuana the folks who won this thing for trump arent the basement dwelling degenerates on td but old rural white people from the farm belt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its going to be awesome when they find out what attorney general sessions thinks about marijuana
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump is going to comment offhand about how videogamers are losers or something trumpettes would explode
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when trump understands that pandering to mainstream conservatives is better than pandering to neckbeards these rthedonald stooges are going to have egg on their face
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and a good amount of people cared renoughsandersspam was a medium sized sub at its peak
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the sub is shitposting but all the beliefs there are serious its a good number of people from pol and the like but there are a lot of actual redditors there reddit isnt exactly the most liberal website
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they are in favour of gays who like trump the rest of us could get electrocuted by pence for all they care and i have never seen thedonald being accepting of the t in lgbt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and what they mean by lgbt rights is gay marriage protecting lgbt people from jobhousing discrimination or letting transgender people piss in the appropriate bathroom is horrendous a bill that would make it legal to refuse medical treatment to lgbt people nationwide is aok
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good job shill
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats the best course of action ive filtered out anything thats related to politics as at least as far as reddit is concerned they are all cesspits unfortunately not everyone has the option to filter out subreddits so i can see why people may want individual ones banned but thats not the answer personally i think the admins should introduce categories that the admins can place any subreddit into whether that subreddit likes it or not then let users have the option to choose to either only see the categories they want to see or to filter out categories so you can filter out everything related to politics sports memes etc or a combination of categories to personalise it further or choose just to see subreddits devoted to gifs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hmm on one hand were witnessing the rise of and legitimatizing of fascism in the us on the other hand people seem to be upset at that yeah both sides really should just calm down cause theyre equally bad in a unique way that makes me superior
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you sound like a shill for insert person that i dont like while were making decency requests here i cant help but feel like people need recognize that the world is not black and white virtually everything is a grey area no politician or policy idea is good or bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this was my bad and its why i took it down my thought process is that because ets is focused on countering the trump spam they might be interested in the post calling for the ban of the source of the trump spam flawed logic and i deleted it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but then theyll just spam rall with angry nonsense oh wait
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the official meaning is what you said but another meaning people seem to use is when a bunch of people swoop in and basically just take over the discussion via numbers in an unfair way its not technically brigading but the results are exactly the same so you can see why people call it brigading honestly thedonald just needs a lesson in pr their approach to dissent does nothing to encourage understanding or respect for them it does the opposite then more people dislike them and then they swoop in again and do the same thing which causes even more people to dislike them etc i havent seen an approach to pr so bad since azalea banks on twitter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and the mobile browser i use doesnt the point is though that nobody should have to filter a subreddit like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,southparks website is shit for a lot of people you mean this clip right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they are just a very loud vocal minority
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it filters through to comment sections in previously unrelated subreddits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not just their posts its their brigading in unrelated subs their witch hunting doxxing threats harassment etc they are blatantly breaking site rules and the onus to fix that is on them not us
SubredditDrama,not_removed,plenty of people that use reddit through a browser dont use res though theres no reason not to use res but they still exist and isnt filtering subreddits locked behind gold to those people the complaints are fair i think
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the problem is all the donald kiddies that then infest other large subs in say truereddit theyre not a majority but theyre there barfing their nonsense into the comment sections their point of view adds nothing theyre just a bunch of assholes and it makes every large community a less pleasant place they need to go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if it was that easy i tried blocking us politics and ended up not home atm so might miss stuffget something wrong with rthedonald rasktrumpsupporters rlockherup rhillaryforprison rjillstein rhillaryclinton rgaryjohnson rlibertarian rconservative rthemeltdown renoughtrumpspam rwikileaks rdncleaks rwikileaks rpolitics and rpizzagate to escape this madness i only added sind i noticed while surfing rall some of them might be dead again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all news and political subreddit i know of are still very liberal politics and other are agressive toward republicains and any idea of the right if thedonald have an influence its with its style that all the left subreddits seems to copy now with shitty links from salon and huffington post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,go to imzy its small but help make it bigger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean filtering it is one thing but having the culture of the site as a whole lean toward the whims of young altright folks definitely makes it less enjoyable for those who post regularly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where are they throwing a temper tantrum theyre not allowed to complain now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if a young child spits in your face just go away dont fix it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at least bernie spam was overwhelmingly positive like the difference between feeling sick because you ate too many sweets vs feeling sick because youve been drinking grease
SubredditDrama,not_removed,was normal upvote patterns and mostly posts about fund raising phone banking results polls etc they mostly kept to themselves they were just big td is endless shitposts and stormfront memes with strange spikes and sticky exploits they also do not keep to themselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh god are you really going to go there theres a difference between overpromoting your candidate and shitposting dank memes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,use an app instead of the browser id recommend reddit is fun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you want to know which hollywood actor was a volunteer firefighter at the time happened
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats how stumbleupon worked but it was terrible for getting info at a glance or coming back to something youd already visited also didnt allow the creation of new categories
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is a great idea but it would make it hard for new users to start getting involved when i got my first account about years ago i relied heavily on the defaults and other users recommendations from there to find subs i really enjoyed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont forget about rdragonsfuckingcars do you like to watch dragons fucking cars i do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think admins have said they want to move away from defaults
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but seriously do you like cats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rcatsstandingup rtheredpill rpolitics rleagueoflegends ratheism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh my goodness do you want us to help you do an intervention
SubredditDrama,not_removed,use reddit enhancement suite or res it will allow you some reprieve on rall you just need to hover over the sub and you can filter it out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not sure i never go to rall maybe someone else will know im pretty curious about this myself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,back at the start the defaults werent all a cesspool i feel like this site got incredibly bad on the default frontpage relatively recently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my friends like visiting the site vanilla and there is so much more that they are missing they see me on reddit all the time and just think i view defaults such a shame
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like watching a ship sinking or a car wreck with lots of police we just cant help enjoying the horror amd drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in my case my old roommate showed me how to use it including how to subunsub installed res for me gud guy indeed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for anyone else the easiest way ive found is from httpswwwredditcomsubreddits and go down the list on the right have to do it in a browser dont think apps support that page
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i never let anybody irl know that i read reddit im ashamed to be associated with it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think cesspool goes a bit far sure certain sections are intolerable cough default subs cough cough but the visual arts subs are pretty good and ill always enjoy writing prompts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup i used to be proud of the karma i worked for it was validating in a way and i feel like ive honed my rhetorical skills through thousands of hours of participation now i not only feel like it was a waste of time but im actually pretty ashamed of it all this place is awful and for what because of some sophomoric devotion to freeze peach because we inexplicably value giving the worst parts of society free server time to preach hatred and bigotry fuck that this place is part of the problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,socrates died for this shit is still the funniest thing ive ever read on this site it has a succinctness that other eradefining pastas they targeted gamers slapping the tendies out of moms hands etc cant compete with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man the drama from back then seems so quaint and innocent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fugging jijler hates freedoms xdddd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the irony is that those guys won and now you just get karma from self posts it took a few years and the admins making a separate decision but still
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god im glad im not the only one who loves rrelationships sorted by controversial
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i always use the defense that if a site has rglorp then it cant be serious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,directions unclear kim stuck in ceiling fan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ketamine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,citation needed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good people not found
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can someone explain
SubredditDrama,not_removed,self awareness never was in ready supply over at thedonald
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see this is whats wrong with this site as spoken by whats wrong with this site
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is it really brigading though i mean like them or not they are a big sub on the site and have as much as right as anyone else to post in other subs it was a popular post on the front pagethat due to the size of thedonald a lot of redditors are going to disagree with theyre still users of the site with as much a right as anyone to voice their opinion maybe i missed a direct link where brigading happened but you cant assume it was brigading just because a lot of people disagreed with the op thedonald is a huge subreddit and the majority of them are going to disagree with the post on rself and agree with the comments disagreeing with the op a popular post on rall goes against the opinion of a lot of people on the site thedonald them voicing that opinion independently after seeing the post isnt brigading it just means a lot of people dont share that opinion on the site its easy to think of subs you dont agree with as different bad or not part of the what you consider reddit but like it or not they are members of the site and voiced their disagreement provided i havent missed any obvious brigading anyway feel free to link it if there was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is it brigading if they found the post on rall
SubredditDrama,not_removed,watch a gay man defend trump of course its milo who else would it be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,😂😂😂 why is that even first things first as if a gay person that supports trump suddenly makes moot the entire post having to do with doxxing and brigading
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that entire thread made me want to claw my eyes out my favorite is their insistence on still accusing anyone antitrump of being a ctr shill you know weeks after the election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was hyped to prove you wrong but that first sentence had me rolling my eyes so hard i pulled a muscle in my brain
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but i thought only the left cares about identity politics yet they trot out any minority that agrees with them to deflect basically any criticism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i couldnt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats their entire mentality punch you until you punch back then cry foul ive seen it over and over its actually their entire strategy and trump does it too so it emboldens them its one of the reasons liberals have such a hard time combating them liberals subscribe to a code of how to treat people and that you shouldnt be disrespectful of people then here comes td shitposting calling you a cuck telling you to kill yourself and saying all sorts of racist shit when you call them out on all their bullshit they reply with shit like the tolerant left and wow why are you so disrespectful theyre just bullies its a crowd of bullies and they do the same shit that elementary school bullies do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,remain calm citizen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actually let them go for it let them expend their energy on rself then they can be legitimately banned and people that cry about it can be told to fuck off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do we get to complain about how the admins are in bed with td now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know im actually curious if a post blows up and hits on all and then a bunch of ideologically driven people vote and comment on it does that count as brigading
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyll swarm us eventually itll be like thermopylae
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id need to stop moddingbeing the only person who posts in rthenau if that were a hard and fast rule and thats just not gonna happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah im annoyed by what this election did to r conspiracy i just wanted to laugh at the time cube and flat earth people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,deleted im a paranoid person
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rcanada is awful now they were bad with agendapushing before but now its atrocious and their profree speech arguments only seem to come into play when they say they dislike preferred pronouns
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the other day a top post was a political cartoon depicting a person with sjw on their shirt becoming outraged over a carrot was downvoted to oblivion for offering criticism its becoming another antipc circlejerk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not even sure if he is a guy he seems more like a lifesize ken doll that became possessed by henry ford to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,after watching him one time ever on drunken peasants podcast i have to say that he is the most disingenuous person theyve ever had on the show and theyve featured a real life uncle ruckus deranged conspiracy theorists and a chronic liar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wtf mods what about free speech
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my favorite are the vote manipulation comments one of them in the support rthethinskinned thread says that since the comments in the original ban thread are so overwhelmingly in support of rthetinyhands it must be vote manipulation theres obviously a conspiracy going on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what happens if the mods snap first
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just read about it today apparently its the definition for people who are mostly vegetarian but sometimes eat meat i thought it was sort of interesting people were making that distinction from people that eat a more mainstream diet im having trouble parsing it myself as far as i can tell its like vegetarian with an asterisk or a but im a vegetarian but having to come up with a label for it struck me as odd i read about it while i was looking for recipes since ive decided i want to go meatless most of the week for environmental reasons
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good times when drama was about atheism ron paul and weed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh god i forgot about the reuropean shitstorm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep the attitude of the the admins to only ever do something once the dumpsterfire spreads to something worth keeping is really ruining the site
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like the venn diagram of those subs and thed are a near perfect circle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only the mangy and sickly ones that nobody wants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,best time to plant a tree was years ago second best time is now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill tire of this as will others and move onto a new online community that doesnt have this kind of bs which just exponentially makes this place a bigger shithole all that will be left is shitbags spewing garbage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eventually ill tire of this as will others and move onto a new online community that doesnt have this kind of bs i suggest checking out imzy they dont allow hate subs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man killed by forum users he criticized forum remains open owner claims they havent broken any rules
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the entire us government is worthless to them as long as ctr controls rpolitics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this doesnt bode well for the next years a group in power that always needs to find a scapegoat someone else whos the real root of all the problems instead of stepping up and leading in a mature manner well its just not going to be pretty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah yes the plucky underdogs spearheaded by a billionaire tycoon who is in no way part of the elite establishment and who despite having just become president elect certainly isnt a politician hes just a regular guy like everybody else nbsp if everybody else looked like an explosion in an orangutan factory
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not uncommon for groups that start as underdogs to keep chasing that sweet sweet victimhood long after they take control christianity being the prime example
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is there an online link by any chance or could you post some of it in the form of reddit comment it sounds interesting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe td could write a book call it my struggle or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the world is hard when youre
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had to stop reading the thread once td users started comparing their struggle on reddit to the struggle of actual refugees this is just another trolling tactic for them to push the boundaries of reason and twist your opponents argument around to absurdly benefit your position if they actually bother responding to that bait the troll has essentially won
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought refugees were a coddled people out to destroy civilization according to these bozos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree it was nauseating however i also had to stop reading my facebook and other subreddits when a number of people called hillary losing the election misogyny in action these issues arent exclusive to td nor are they exclusive to reddit or trump supporters these are the current social issues were living in and frankly i find tds attitude as sick as half of the people who comment about td users like theyre some kind of alien species who are dumb fucks cause its that attitude that mobilized the support who led to trump winning the whole holier than thou shit has to stop everyone here and online in general has the biggest justice boner with being able to call a certain group of people stupid and its reducing human interaction to the lowest fucking common denominator the leads to discussions about the future of a country being turned into memes and click bait articles and end up with a tv star being voted president ultimately shit happens you sometimes want something and you dont get it you sometimes dont want something and youre forced to accept it but what must continue is healthy discussion and debate as much as possible so for td threads to reduce everything to were a minority and fighting the system is stupid af but so are half the comments on threads like this saying zomg td users are all stupid fedora wearing kids amirite the whole situation is fucking sad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive definitely seen people still bitching about ctr in rpolitics but when asked about why hillary would still be paying people to astroturf after losing the election they say soros is footing the bill now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously im not a huge fan of soros myself but they crossed the borderline antisemitism line a long long time ago and just hang on to him as a punching bag
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its sort of like nazi propaganda wherein the jews were simultaneously rats who could be stomped out in an instant and an international cabal and the true power behind every oppression and injustice thats ever happened
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aint that the truth i finally realized it the other day after months of watching arguments with trump supporters they sling a few potshots but as soon as people try to have actual conversations with them they cut bait and run and thats by necessity they have to limit themselves to memes sarcasm and jokes because its so damn difficult to actually defend the man or his policies as soon as factsevidencesources are invoked theyre basically forced to concede on the spot it means that substantive discussions are just off the table for them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i was checking out rasktrumpsupporters and if you actually read through some of the bigger threads you quickly learn they know nothing about policy or are completely unable to defend their positions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like their talks of white genocide and how they are treated like refugees and people are trying to segregate them the irony of what they preach
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its so weird to me like who gives a shit do they think theyre going to convert people are they just that bored why do they do it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when it suited them which it hasnt in years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt suit advertisers so it wont suit reddits future anyone who thinks that a business that allows noholdsbarred speech can survive for long is deluded and by the way its only cultural for a specific vocal subset of american reddit users in germany holocaust denial is illegal and the majority of germans are perfectly fine with that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the us is the only place ive been in the world that protects hate speech culturally or constitutionally
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the existence of moderator powers directly contradicts that notion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a pr issue that can be both presented as a favor to trump or something that attracts the opposition but maybe the admins just want to stay out of politics on that level and keep their status quo and thats fine at some point normal users will just leave and find some other website to hang on then theyll have to learn the lesson the hard way protect your site your communities or lose them maybe theyre just not paid for that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then well handle it like we handle any tweet from trump we sigh at his stupidity and move on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uhmreally isnt it good for publicity if he mentions reddit directly i imagine a lot of liberals would actually join reddit if trump were to mention it negatively so it might just balance out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the toppest post of all time was obama won the presidency and everyone calling it historical progress an age of liberalism and a new era the toppest post on the donald was when he won the presidency and now everyone should suck their schlongs and prepare to be droned or deported
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre equating active participants to just the casual user the casual user who doesnt give a shit about comments and other meta garbage doesnt care about it they are here for cat pics porn and whatever they were linked here for from facebooktwitterwhere ever taking that on its face value which is always what it boils down to is helping drive the site with views and clicks which makes the site money like i said it doesnt really matter to the finance people of reddit just as long as they are getting paid thats why the donald hasnt been deleted and affiliated subs probably wont be either unless they really violate site rules even then who knows
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they were completely missing that mobile traffic is not included in their stats page while more than of reddits pageviews is through apps these days
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trying to turn reddit into basically hey at least pretends that pol is contained
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it used to be faux outrage nowadays i think they actually believe theyre being suppressed and that hillary in the bastard demon child of hitler and stalin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a classic bully technique poke and prod someone constantly until they snap back then go crying to someone else and pretend youve done nothing wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree completely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and dont forget the messages that one default mod got because her died recently died messages were like lol your dog is dead shillcuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,internet regulation and censoring is great cuz it will stop those damn liberals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they may never find out because im sure if you mention it there your reply gets removed and youre banned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuck calming down if lazyass liberal youths dont kick this fascist movements teeth in over the next four years it could literally be the world at stake you know what as far as im concerned fuck moderates too being in the middle is enabling the right theyre preying on your naïveté and weakness get on board or get the fuck out of the way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no we are not witnessing the ride of fascism you are just being overly dramatic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cue south park closing credits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no politician or policy idea is good or bad hah thats godwinbait if ive ever seen it yeah no bad people and ideas exist and a great many of them are political maybe not bad in your estimation but sure as fuck in mine your argument like much of the postelection handwringing on the left we just need to understand why uneducated whites dont care what happens to minorities brings to mind those old lines of yeats the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair he responded in a concise and civilized manner how is that a cunt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ets is trump spam
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and then theres that time where the donald mod provided screen shots that proved you were talking about bullshit nearly the entire time yet for some unknown fucked up reason you tried to stand by your original statement so you want rules and common sense to apply to everyone else but not you or anyone against trump thats pretty much the summary of your winded rant ps you cant just brush that off with oh yea my bad you literally just did what you were complaining about jesus fucking christ
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but i thought they were the silent majority s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also mobile users get fucked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats my entire reason id rather they just go i know they wont all go away thats a silly notion and all that theyd all ahem selfdeport but it would at least reduce the incidence of the most low effort td trolls i just cant stand this stuff filtering into other subs i mostly stick to pretty niche subreddits and use res so my exposure im sure is much less than others experience but ive seen this crap in adviceanimals of all places
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah if you have a problem with something you make a meme and call them a cuck like an adult
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you so much no idea why i never thought to check out some of the unofficial apps downloaded a few and am loving them much appreciated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this should be the be new narwhal bacons at midnight anytime you hear someone say steve buscemi you have to inform the individual who spoke his name that he once broke both his arms and got jerked off by his mom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you want to know which cover song was so good that the original artist said the song now belongs to the covering artist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that takes me back but yea its a great idea
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it would be easy to do something like this though list the top subs by subscriber count and then the top in major categories like politics sports humor gaming tvmoviesmusic select some stuff from the list and wade in with your new custom front page grow from there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yea and defaults arent necessarily a bad thing either lots of genuinely interesting stuff and the reposts arent a big deal if youre new and its great to have a community that seems so active and receptive to hook people its not until you dig a bit deeper and notice some of the shady shit that happens that you rely on like minded people to help curate your experiences but dipping into rall every now and then just to get out of our self made echo chambers is a good idea
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dunno works for pinterest
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you disgusting monster keep your dragons fucking cars ill stick with my cars fucking dragons as god intended
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a thing of course it is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i prefer rcarsfuckingdragons myself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its never too late to change source used to obsessively browse youtube comments and argue with people there when i was in my early teens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i havent even been on here relatively long but when i joined up the biggest meta annoyance was people complaining about ratheism and the new confession bear meme on radviceanimals simpler times i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,part of this is that places like pol the daily stormer and various other straight up hate groups actively come here to recruit spread their introduction ideology and turn it into a place that caters to them reddits initial mission statement helped them with this very lax moderation a laissez faire attitude to managing the content and a misguided idea that reddit would have more segmentation than ended up being the case what i mean is there was an idea that people would basically stick to just the subs they subscribe to and that there wouldnt really be major intersub travel basically these guys move in abuse the system and make it shitter and shitter for regular users people who do just stick to their own subs and never wander into defaults or use res or god forbid actually buy gold and use their filtering never notice it a place like rmechanicalkeyboards would have never seen this drama if thats all they go to but for the normal users the defaults and rall just get worse and worse its just not worth it to actually engage these guys since theyre not acting in good faith and if they do manage to get banned they have as many alts as they could ever want eventually the amount of normal users just declines and the pigs are left to wallow in the mud hole theyve made reddit really really needs to take a long hard look at what they want their site to become the system of glass the forest fire once it threatens the integrity of our site doesnt work all youre left with is a cycle of assholes taking over the whole site for months at a time and disrupting everything then a bunch of shit once you decide to ban it and a week or two of peach once it blows over step the fuck up admins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the worst that was on the front page within a few months when i joined was chili and the follow up ice soap its all been downhill since
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at least it was bareable when hour old posts were not regularly on the front page oldest is hours as of this post this doesnt sound bad until you realize that scrolling even or pages deep will get you tons of of day old posts youve already seen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i never let anybody irl know that i read reddit because idk anybody irl because im the kind of person who reads reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if i mention reddit i say that its a terrible site because it basically is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same i dont want people to think im some misogynist altright fatshamer the couple times i told someone i use reddit i explicitly said i just use it to follow the giants and warriors
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at some point a few years ago we noticed if you googled reddit jailbait was one of the links in googles sub menu for the site the first link maybe great when you tell your friends coworkers family to check out reddit and they google it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my girlfriend is always mentioning it casually when were out in public she doesnt understand why im shushing her the site is just so cringey
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes i mean the whole website in general which means mostly the default subs there are certainly enjoyable subs reason why i keep coming back here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,many of the sports subs are still good i really enjoy the community in rcfb and their mod team is really solid theyve raised money for charity met up at games supported players whove been injured and mourned with their dedicated rivals when something tragic has happened its still a good place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but thats the entire problem the good parts of this platform are being used to subsidize some of the worst people people in existence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,linky linky please
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my favorite srd post is the pokemon cant consent to sex drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love it because in my understanding of socrates shitty maymays and aggressive rathiesm are pretty much exactly what he died for he chose not to escape athens because his commitment to trolling was real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its shit all the way down from here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean i kinda get it reddit has a bit more impact than forums like mommies with tommys i mean look at the boston bomber incident but the extent of the outrage baffles me like calling that one guy the next snowden what seriously seriously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,about that subreddit you just linkedwhat the fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you now have been banned from rpyongyang
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this guy knows you dont bring up ketamine as unplugging reality if you only meant to make a silly drugs are crazy guys joke but yeah its like if you unplugged your computer but the cpu kept running dutifully calculating the random electrical noise created by heat and static electricity like genuine inputs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but they upvote a picture of donald trump holding up an lgbt flag
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean its the same reason im agnostic i recognize that i cant prove something doesnt exist so while i have no evidence that any of them are good people i do have to acknowledge that its possible for one of them to be good people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a reference to the speech where trump said mexico was sending us rapists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,object permanence is a bit of a struggle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its reflective of their politicians block everything in government look how inefficient the government is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i assume peter thiel has better things to do like nursing tenyear grudges against gossip blogs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,peter thiel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its funny how they hide behind a gay guy who thinks lesbians act gay for attention and that gay people should stay in the closet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,interesting how when he says something fucked up hes a provocateur and troll but for everything else hes their getoutofbeingcalledbigoted free card closest thing this election cycle to uncle ruckus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the equivalent of a person saying theyre not racist because they have a black friend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no one takes identity politics as seriously as these fuckwads
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive seen multiple people in different subreddits saying notice how different rpolitics was immediately on nov when they werent getting paid anymore i honestly havent noticed any of the articles posted are still antitrump and the comments below threshold are mostly protrump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its their only defense lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shouldnt all the ctr shills be protrump now trumps tax plan will work well for all those millions they made from shilling reddit think of the tax incentives
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow a million dollars goes a long way these days
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly its not just a problem liberals have the republicans had the same problem with trump in the primaries the only thing i still dont really understand is how this tactic works on nearly half the voter population edit pedantic clarity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a parttime teacher so i deal with kids a favorite thing for some to do is to bully someone and then when the victim finally hits back they cry to teacher to gain sympathy thats exactly what these little shits from td do and im fed up with it i dont even give a fuck about trump or hillary or bernie much anymore i just want this sub gone rconservatives and whatever else can stay these td cunts need to go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i imagine a bully shoving a kid in the back every seconds and after ages the kid turns around and punches the bully in the lip td was nonstop calling spez a pedophile how can they take the high ground
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont get why the admins just dont nuke td there the admins they can make whatever rules they feel like just straight up stonewall them and ban all dissent lines they did with fph notice how the fph shit had more of less dissappeared just get it over with admins its a running theme reddit wont do anything to combat shitty peopleculture unless it gives them negative pr jailbaitcoontown and that ilk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see and i just dont give a fuck as a liberal i never claimed to be tolerant or loving they are fascists and should kill themselves fuck the standards
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wouldnt say in bed more like the admins are into sm and are addicted to rthedonald for this service
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the admins have fairly sophisticated tools to tell them where users are coming from if someone is clicking a link from rall they know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its time i unsub as well the mods are trying to be fair and i respect that but pizza gate feels more like a fever dream than an interesting conspiracy its too polarizing and people wont allow anyone to question it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rampant antisemitism and saying dead kids were actors didnt make you unsubscribe but a couple of trolls did lol ok rconspiracy was always shit and i dont understand how any sane adult can enjoy that cesspool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh no the graffiti kill all muslims is a false flag it is really the left spraypainting it to make us right look weally weally bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i unsubbed recently due to this shit as a canadian to say that subreddit is shameful is an understatement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but if the majority are antipc does that make them the new pc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,since thed ruined rself for a while and you didnt get to have your discussion i think its great reducing our negative impact on the world as much as possible is definitely a worthwhile endeavor i started out trying to be a flexitarian over a year ago for both environmental and animal rights reasons i didnt think i would be happy completely giving up meat in the end i found myself not missing meat and decided to go full vegetarian i havent looked back not to say thats where you will or should end up i do applaud you following through on your convictions its really difficult to give up or cut back on things we enjoy for a good that we may never directly experience so good on you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant believe the reason i made the account was the atheism bullshit of now its way worse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and bitcoin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whenwhat happened with reuropean
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats like at least the best time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,spez editing a post is the greatest civil liberties issue of our time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you didnt see this before when trump is blaming everyone but the ushimself for problems
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres been a curious lack of the election is rigged since the election ended
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i too am interested
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry i dont have an online link as ive never been published ill give you a bit of a summary this was specific to the minnesota klan of the they published a newspaper and often chronicled their rallies and consistently claimed counter protests violence against them in the rallies so whenever they made one of those claims i checked the local paper of their rally to determine if theres any truth to the events one big trend was they were often not covered by local papers the biggest challenge was finding events they claimed corroborated anywhere when i did the details didnt match up the klans paper consistently had larger crowd sizes than the corresponding local paper violence against the klan was not found whenever there were arrests it was always the klan members getting arrested reading their paper was really interesting overall they were really focused on being a real american had quizzes you could do to see if youre patriotic enough they also really had a hardon for hating on columbus i saw anti columbus articles frequently in their paper and they promoted lief erickson as the true discoverer of america
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mstruggle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the source that is quoting my candidate verbatim is obviously biased and cannot be accepted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have ran into people who still insist trump isnt racist and refuse to say that his infamous mexicans quote wasnt racist because he tacked on that i suppose theres some good ones
SubredditDrama,not_removed,had a guy in rconservative the other day tell me the pencehamilton situation was on par with kkk levels of bigotry against conservatives i was banned for asking him how he makes it trough the day with that victim complex
SubredditDrama,not_removed,butbutbut the leftists and fake news and pizza and clintons
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have seen so many of them say that the left is trying to smear trump and if you actually listened to him and had context youd know he couldnt possibly be racist hillary in the other hand is incredibly racist anti gay transphobic islamophobic xenophobic a rape and sexual assault apologist a shill for corporations literally a satanistthat she started the birther movement hell she probably bankrupted her casinos and married melania trump theres no depth to the projection ive seen bandied about by trump supporters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which same question why what are they meant to be influencing right now seems like a great time in the election cycle to take a break
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my reply is that im now unemployed and have nothing better to do that browse reddit they usually get confused at that point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nice parenthetical balancing bruh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,apparently spros was worse than the nazis according to them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats the thing with the parentheses
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you want to fight you need a reason to fight and preferably have a chance of winning who better to fight than an existential threat to your people and way of life who also are so weak and cowardly that victory is assured
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup once you start bringing things into the conversation like citations from us supreme court cases or the us constitution or various laws they get upset call you a cuck which i fucking hate as a term and back out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,never believe that antisemites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies they know that their remarks are frivolous open to challenge but they are amusing themselves for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly since he believes in words the antisemites have the right to play they even like to play with discourse for by giving ridiculous reasons they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors they delight in acting in bad faith since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert if you press them too closely they will abruptly fall silent loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past it is not that they are afraid of being convinced they fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side sartre
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just hang around asktrumpsupporters for a few days and you can see this in action nearly every thread its great
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or theyll just throw those sources out the window and demand new ones thats been very popular
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not to mention acting like a moron makes it easier for them to back off with it was just a joke in case that trump fucks shit up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do they think theyre going to convert people are they just that bored why do they do it its a little bit of both yes some people want to covert others those being the white nationalists who have an actual vested interest in changing people and the others are professional trolls who just love to be complete shit bags while online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its simply because they have nothing better to do and its to hide their insecurities when called out on how pathetic they are they pull the it was just a troll prank card
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not since they realized that it was cutting into their potential profits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,since at least
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no not really you get to make your own subreddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the toppest post on the donald is a jeb meme
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the top post of all time is about jar jar binks being a sith
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but is it really good for user participation when like out of the top submissions at any given time are political shitposts it might be worse now than before the election there are jerks on both sides with the rightwing end being insufferable in having emotional breakdowns about any criticism whatsoever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those casual users the more suggestible ones at least are being constantly barraged with fascist propaganda that is explicitly intended to manipulate them on a subconscious nonrational level reddit being literally a neonazi propaganda site with a builtin lure in the form of cat pics and porn is precisely what is so insidious and evil about it like i said it doesnt really matter to the finance people of reddit just as long as they are getting paid which is a completely morally bankrupt attitude to have just because the liberals always predictably capitulate to the fascists if there is money in it doesnt mean that is the right thing to do if anything it is an indictment of the revolting moral abscess that is liberal capitalism itself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they are here for cat pics porn and whatever they were linked here for from facebooktwitterwhere ever you think people want to see nazi propaganda you think bigmoney advertisers like ford or mcdonalds are gonna pay money for brand advertising on a nazi site keeping td on reddit doesnt help anybody but the assholes it doesnt help the finances it doesnt help the userbase it doesnt help the world ban them and be vocal about not tolerating hate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hates pol because pol is a containment board that failed to serve its purpose recently when hiroshima nagasaki owner forgot his actual name announced that he might have to delete some boards a erupted because so many people were begging for pol to be deleted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres a dude in this thread right now trying to sell pizza gate the faux outrage is on the way out the satanic panic is on the way in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just like with reddit large groups of anonymous people makes everything turn to shit is tolerable good even when discussing things that are niche enough to not attract the large groups of people discussing such topics on is better than on reddit as you either get to discuss it or it just dies away whereas small communities on reddit often take several hours or even days to respond
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ok dude keep your head in the sand about rising hate crimes or rising number of hate groups
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to prove me wrong show me a policy idea that is bad its always good for someone my point here is that polarization hurt everyone in this election i know it sounds hippydippy but we should be working together instead of creating an usvsthem attitude clinton is a perfect example here sure there is plenty to criticize and on the whole maybe it means you dont want to vote for her thats all fine but her tax plan benefited the poor much more than cut so the poor would benefit more under clinton but theres no room for subtlety like this if someone is a trump or bernie supporter shes a liar and corrupt and yadda yadda yadda
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can i get a link to those screenshots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no insults or personal attacks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you have been unsubscribed from buscemi facts you have been subscribed to dicaprio facts today you will learn that leonardo dicaprio cut his hand in django unchained
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lost the use of both arms he didnt break them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that would mean thedonald would be a default
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or a search bar with what are some of your interests and if you type in bicycles or biking rbicycling will pop up type in breaking bad and rbreakingbad will pop up type in weed and rtrees will pop up that one will need to be explained every subreddit just needs a few tags as correct names might not get you to the exact subreddit ie rbicycling might be the biggest subreddit about bicycles but bikes should be able to get you there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah holy shit youtube comments like i know its cliche at this point but like two weeks ago i left one comment helping answer someones question on a video and almost immediately got called an autist by someone with a pepe avatar youtube comments are actually worse than the jokes about them would lead you to believe which is insane
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol years ago i argued with someone on there that yoshis island for the snes was the same game as yoshis island for the gba i still think about it every once in a while
SubredditDrama,not_removed,member when unpopular opinion puffin was your most disliked part of reddit edit hahaha and today td actually has one on its front page
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is all so true reddit as a community cant decide if its grandmas aol pornhub twitter vine an early message board or facebook news feed it really feels like reddit as a company is damned if they do and damned if they dont so they are circus performers with no boundary between the audience and the trained animals sometimes people get bit and the circus as a business seems like a shit show personally i cant stand all this nonsense it is really annoying and makes me want to stop using reddit since im a lib itd probably make td happy but reddit as a company wont be too happy if they lose people like me in droves they wouldnt be happy if all the td people left either reddit is officially as divided as american political culture and its not going to get any better for at least four more years i wonder if the company will be able to straddle the fence and keep everyone happy and make a profit otherwise theyll fail im not sure they can pull it off only time will tell
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and a misguided idea that reddit would have more segmentation than ended up being the case what i mean is there was an idea that people would basically stick to just the subs they subscribe to and that there wouldnt really be major intersub travel i find this rather interesting because its the polar opposite of in this regard boards are as segmented as can be you stick to your board and few if anyone crossposts to more than or of the something boards but moot never got that and assumed everyone would move boards depending on whatever topic they felt like discussing yet it didnt happen instead the boards all mostly hate each other with reddit you see the expectation of segmentation yet instead everyone crossposts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and were in the circlejerk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,since the beginning of this election cycle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,meirl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if caught i would make sure that people know that i only browse reddit for the porn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all of my girlfriends do the same very annoying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this website is extremely useful for unfocused technical information take the recent pokémon game sunmoon its much easier to find the best pokefinder spots on the pokémon subreddit than it is by googling it another good example is the space subreddit i forgot the date of a particular announcement a few months back and whenever i tried googling for it something else much more popular came up first but not on reddit the academic subreddits are easily connected in a single account rather than information scattered across forums literally anything besides politics is very functional the politics includes this subreddit which is effectively the politics of the reddit community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,askreddit is a super unique sub and id honestly be okay browsing just that sub and maybe aww
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,member the quickmeme killer pepperidge farm remembers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im agnotstic because im too lazy to disprove the existence of god and im too lazy to go to church
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah reddits gotten really annoying from a european perspective
SubredditDrama,not_removed,show me the goddamn math that proves that ball is still there if mom throws a blanket on it i fucking dare you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair fuck gawker
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no relation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right so long as their black friend is also a racist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its legit the whole argument behind trump is not racist there are black asian or muslim trump supporters therefore trump cannot be racist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cough ben carson cough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly on the night of the election when it became clear to me that trump was going to win i was very concerned that a lot of active antitrump users would de facto abandon rpolitics in despair paving the way for a takeover by td i remember when i didnt look at rukpolitics for a few months and then came back to find the subreddit was a lot more right wing proukip and protory than i remembered it being to the extent that i saw several conversations about which obscure conservative politicians had the most accurate ideas about society after some digging i found out that pol had organised a brigade getting its own users to create reddit accounts and submit and upvote links and comments for a few weeks until a lot of the regular commenting userbase retreated to runitedkingdom in inglorious defeat the mods of rukpolitics alas were entirely unconcerned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,haha it really is they havent figured out how to defend trump its all still a reflection to hillary its about as hilarious as it is frightening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only thing i still dont really understand is how this tactic works on nearly half the population it didnt a large portion of the population are ineligible to vote and a bunch chose not to vote in the presidential election of the population voted trump and he won voted clinton and she lost voted independent of the two major parties were ineligible unregistered or didnt participate for some other reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because when it comes down to it most people are bastards
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jeb and little marco showed up expecting debates and were clearly shocked that they got a grade school gym class instead
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a parttime teacher so i deal with kids a favorite thing for some to do is to bully someone and then when the victim finally hits back they cry to teacher to gain sympathy td is basically eric cartman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rrepublican is actually a pretty good sub in my opinion ive never had any issues posting there as an open liberal really respectful folks overall that said td is fucking cancer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it drives me crazy i feel like spez has no balls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in before someone calls you a smug elitist or regressive or some other bullshit like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we shall fight in the mod queue we shall fight in new
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think i unsubscribed from rcanada around months year ago because the sub became unbearable everything from rabidly defending rapists or rape culture ie that victim shouldnt have drank so much if she didnt want to be raped to harassing users who disagreed with them i was tired of the political hatred the misogynists the racists and the bitterness that filled the subreddit to the brim i can only imagine how much worse the subreddit became during the american election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you talking about the faces of atheism thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,happened last year reurope is a default sub if youre in europe reuropean is an alternative sub that was pretty dominated by farright users lots of antimuslim antiimmigration posts this was at the height of the european immigration crisis anyways reurope mods are thinking reuropean users are brigading mass upvoting antiimmigration posts and such imagine it as a hostile takeover you flood a weaker sub with your content and get your members to up vote it all eventually brietbart gets involved writes an article about reurope mods being leftwing sissies the usual brietbart crap ends with reuropean being quarantined just like srs there are a lot of parallels between what reuropean did and what td has done regardless of everyones opinion admins have solid precedence to take action theyve done it for less edit i thought i read that srs was quarantined but apparently im mistaken
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really though you should have seen this td post in particular the amount of effort formatting and sourcing that they put into a post about spezgiving was amazing who really has the time to invest in that sort of triviality its the stupidest shit ever treated like its a phd dissertation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i did see it before and thats one of the many reasons i didnt vote for him ive also seen it happening in other countries where you have postrevolutionary leaders leading as if they were still fighting their enemies it doesnt ever turn out well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they probably still believe that hillary was rigging the election but failed because trump and his supporters were just too smart for her and saw through her lies or some shit not to mention all the whack jobs threatening to violently overthrow the government if clinton won suddenly calmed down and simply said that people just need to accept the results strange that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive seen people claim it was still rigged but they somehow beat the rigging by voting harder or something because in the wacky race that was the election they think clinton was some kind of dick dastardly who simultaneously cheated blatently and still couldnt win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was annoyed that trump won pa not only because it helped him win overall but because earlier that day they were whining nonstop about how the machines in their state were rigged
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that sounds like a fantastic paper i would encourage you to seek publication if youre still able ive never heard of this hardon for lief erickson im not doubting you im just wondering why that wasis the case
SubredditDrama,not_removed,muh kampf by donny drumpf
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mkampf
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its an insult driven campaign them shills would know all about an insult driven campaign
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like to cite the whole situation where trump said an american born judge couldnt pass fair judgement on him because the judge was from mexican ancestry as my example of trump being racist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but hillary is the worst for calling half of trump supporters deplorable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah man theyve gone even farther now now theyre just outright denying that he ever said that and any footage is faked by the lame stream media
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can see why only shills could possibly disagree with them and shills cant be unemployed because shilling is a job ergo an unemployed person who disagrees with them is a paradox have you double checked to make sure you actually exist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people who use jewscareparens are the most unbalanced of them all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,confusingly if you probe far enough they also accuse soros of collaborating with the nazis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well he was a jew who had the temerity to survive the final solution of course theyd hate him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,neonazi code for this guy is a jew
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikitripleparentheses
SubredditDrama,not_removed,neonazis alt right morons on twitters used it to tag journalists or opposition they thought or knew were jewish
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or they tell you that you sound like you need a safe space
SubredditDrama,not_removed,great quote frankly the bash the fash people have been making better and better points as we watch once again the rise of an extremist farright you know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh my god that completely describes the alt right they know they cant convince people theyre right so they just seek to provoke and discredit their opponents racists have traditions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so how do you fight that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bbbut free speech valuable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no you dont understand your five seperate articles from the nyt wsj npr bbc and the economist are fake news my source of usafreedommnewsru breitbart and infowars are more trustworthy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or theyll make outrageous claims and provide sources but when you check the sources theyre completely unrelated when you point this out they say thats just the beginning read for yourself go to rsomebullshit if youre serious about the truth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the others are professional trolls who just love to be complete shit bags while online i legitimately dont see the appeal i just dont get it who enjoys being terrible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and that the awful shits of the internet would take advantage of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,foolish guac bowl merchant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ahh the primaries shitposting was at its prime with so much material to work with and the trump that could not be stumped
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pretty sure he meant to say top post of rpolitics edit turns out it isnt the top post but it was and a half years ago but now about posts about how great bernie is overtook it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,once the fascists have their claws on power guess who are the first purge liberal capitalists and the free speech the fascists hid behind for decades gets stripped from the liberals immediately because only liberals care about free speech fascists just coopt any ideals around them to scramble into power
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pol or news or whatever moot has called it several times in the past has been deleted several times to quell the racist bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hiroyuki is kinda a money whore though he monetizes chan boards thats his policy i doubt actually has server issues considering they dont actually archive any datajust store it for a couple of days and then delete slow movingold posts anything that gets a reaction goes nuclear on this has been true since day if people really cared they would just nuke from orbitlike the current cp policy by janitors just delete the posts with cp in them and if too much content is posted nuke the thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god fuck it all im having another whiskey you want one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its such an embarrassment that popular subs have upvoted comments supporting pizzagate and downvotes on anything else what the fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a policy idea thats a hundred percent bad nuclear war one thats been proposed during this election tariffs completely bad they hurt everyone in an economy from top to bottom even those that violate tariffs by smuggling get hurt because of increased prices on the goods they buy at home
SubredditDrama,not_removed,slavery holocaust sodomy laws forced removal of minorities etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,took a quick look at his history not a single name calling and abusive behavior for the first few pages so what made that guy a cunt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its one of the higher up voted comments in his self post that was posted by a td mod im on mobile but ill see if i can find it spez here you go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,leonardo dicaprio is a vegetarian and he threw up when eating real bison liver in the revenant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and he just kept acting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and he only kissed her once while they were orgasming together it was awkward so they never did it again the kissing they still orgasmed together
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he did however break them volunteering as a firefighter during
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well might as well if hes gonna be leader of the free world for years ¯ツ¯
SubredditDrama,not_removed,subs funny etc have million
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i havent even glanced at a youtube comment section in quite some time butwow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that was still pretty bad i feel like the year olds who grew up on the borderlineracist unpopular opinion puffins and sad bears grew into year old full blown racist rthedonald users
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reddit as a community cant decide if its grandmas aol pornhub twitter vine an early message board or facebook news feed thats because reddit as a whole simply isnt a community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reddit is officially as divided as american political culture and its not going to get any better for at least four more years even worse than american culture we have probably the number of white supremacists here lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like to use my front page as a way to look only at smaller subs of niche interests i have that would never make it to the rall and use rall to see the interesting stuff that would otherwise drown out the small subs on my front page or i did until the past fucking year and a half happened please let end
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because its an easy way to find content that you didnt know you were interested in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because its nice to find new stuff everyday that is outside of my normal circle of subs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i use rall to downvote td and i wish more people would
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the problem is that users from default subreddits and td are always spamming their political rhetoric and general bigotry around nonpolitical even nonamerican subreddits what could be a great reddit experience like say sharing opinions on climate change commenting on attempts to go to mars or just liveblogging a good television episode becomes the perpetual annoyance this website currently is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus fucking christ that was years ago im wasting my life away on this site
SubredditDrama,not_removed,american perspective also
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just replace ball with racism and youre there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,saw one of em use a pic of trumps face as a reaction to people saying hillary is a better candidate like what theyre not candidates amymore she lost and hes the presidentelect it feels like theyre still in the mindset that he is still some underdog candidate when hes not anymore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also most trump voters dont act like the people on td theyre regular people who were pissed at the way things are going for them and didnt trust hillary because shes untrustworthy the basket of deplorables comment reflected this hillary knew most people voting for trump were just discouraged but not hateful people but that there was another group that was loud and vocal with absolutely hateful rhetoric too bad that half was so caught up in their victim narrative that they painted her comment as her calling anyone voting trump deplorable fits right into their victim complex
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bastard coated bastards with bastard filling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why not add it to the colorful list of td insults ive received today during my trolling runs fag sjw cuck race traitor neomarxist and i think i was called shill once when you troll and get people angry you can get people to reveal how they really feel who they really are its telling how when a liberal gets angry they are more likely to call you a name that implies youre hurting people fascist homophobe racist contrast that with someone from the altright whose insults are against your very identity and occasionally things beyond your control like sexuality edit added liberal insults for clarity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre browsing a sub dedicated to conspiracy theories and youre mad that theyre acting like conspiracy theorists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just like srs dont remember srs ever getting quarantined
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are a lot of parallels between what reuropean did and what td has done considering how theyre the same users
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ummm hm oh i got one data caps the internet is an inalienable human right i wonder how theyll react to trumps fcc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who really has the time to invest in that sort of triviality well i mean here we all are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats exactly what they believe she rigged the election and lost because something something reasons something something cuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i find it how theyre fine with ill accept the result if i win but now anyone complaining about the result is a whiner i guess its really best to just assume they dont understand logic or are just fine being willfully ignorant of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup im not a fan of clinton i think there are a lot of legitimate grievances against her and i voted for her only as a vote against trump but people make her out to be the devil incarnate and i justlike jesus people you always accuse us of comparing trump to hitler but have yall looked at how you talk about hillary and her supporters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like to point out when he posted the fake murder statistics even if he is telling the truth that he believed they were real what was he trying to achieve by posting it other than black people are really bad guys he was clearly trying to incite prejudice against blacks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my favorite response i get to this is that judge was a member of la raza therefore he was biased they completely ignore the fact thats a completely different la raza group and just run with the breitbart headline
SubredditDrama,not_removed,out of one side of his mouth his parents are legal immigrants from mexico he must be of a particular political persuasion out of the other legal immigrants love me you cant have it both ways
SubredditDrama,not_removed,funny thing is there are surveys out there that indicate that she literally may have been on point with that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,spez probably edited it into the videos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought about checking but it triggered an existential crisis for now im just going to stick with being schrodingers rodent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,schroedingers shill
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my rabbi was super sad to hear how prevalent antisemitism is becoming again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its nazis and jews all the way down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive often seen the accusation that he sold his parents to the nazis which is surprising since they escaped with him to america and died in the
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how very subtle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus christ can we use kind of syntax for neonazis and then maybe one for nerds and for adhd people and you could mix them up so forexample would mean im posting on a forum in the nineties
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til also wtf
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gotta be honest i think i might be getting slowly converted to a fashbasher nazi punks fuck off has been the background music in my head for a while now edit loving that this turned into music recommendations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it nails the milo yiannopolous faction in particular
SubredditDrama,not_removed,with a baseball bat wrapped in a chain
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people have allowed them to balance the playing field by making the msm somehow equal and opposing counterparts to places like breitbart and infowars ive said it before but people really dont care about facts or news nearly as much as they care about their team winning and for them to appear to be winning at all times
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who enjoys being terrible the people who get bullied in life or the people who have shit jobs and spend every day getting yelled at by a crappy manager who makes their life hell or the alcoholic parents they have to come home to everyday and take care of or etc etc etc life can be tough for a lot of people and they want a place where they can just use that aggression they build up all day long somewhere they sure as hell cant do it in real life to anyone they just dont have the ability to do that so the internet provides that anonymous mask the other portion are entitled assholes who usually have shit parents who dont raise them right to respect others and become the bullies in this situation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man i miss that brief time when the donald was just hilarious antigop memes where i could be upvoted for suggesting they make friends with bernie supporters in order to help their candidate the sub is cancer but its in large part to the aggressive nazi mods
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what i wouldnt give for that holy guacamole now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres some in my next couple hour plan for sure
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill have a pizza please one with a nice tight asshole if possible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in those screenshots it does show them not caring about harassment does td has a reading impediment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not a vegetarian and id also probably throw up if i had to eat bison liver
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he looks at the lake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ok too much for me now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i disable comments on most of my videos because thankfully most trolls arent motivated enough to follow a link to be an asshole on a different platform but yeah lesson learned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,properly moderated comments sections are rather good like the ones on the various pbs youtube channels but not many seem to bother with that it seems
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive said this before but reddit is basically a forum platform that basically lets you access multiple forumns with the same single account this means that people who normally would not interact are thus forced into the same space
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the interesting stuff that would otherwise drown out the small subs on my front page uhm thats not how your frontpage works i constantly see submissions with upboats from tiny subreddits between those with thousands
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i only discuss politics here nowadays if its on rneutralpolitics rneutraltalk or rneutralnews because people are actually civil reasonable and mature there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is nice but they are invading all the subs im on and upvoting eachother hatefilled assholes do not make for fun times it is kind of a drag tbh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reddit age d
SubredditDrama,not_removed,martian perspective also
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the cyber is an inalienable human right ftfy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they wont when he talks about it theyll talk about the hidden message you cucks arent getting and praise him for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think she likely underestimated it no way only half of his supporters are deplorable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fucking spez hes been editing everything i bet hes the one who edits pictures to make the earth look round
SubredditDrama,not_removed,schrödingers rodent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well they aint known for their smarts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought while reading it that it sounded like milo to a t
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive already flogged this article once but this article fucking
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lucille is barbed wire fyi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what a pure example of the golden mean fallacy well i want to kill a hundred thousand babies and you dont want to kill any so why dont we compromise and only kill five thousand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks for the down vote you asked for the screenshots i provided them along with the entire comment for context they banned the user in question what more do you think they should do to that user there isnt anything more they can do in my opinion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i browse youtube i use the herp derp extension all comments turn into just random herp herp derp derp herp derps that you have to click on to see what was really said it really improves things it just sucks when youtube changes the coding and the author needs a few days to update the scripting the other one replaces video comments with reddit threads if you get lucky you get an amazing thread going on about how someone really loves porn and how the music video youre watching was playing on the radio the day he stole his first skin mag
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that would seem to be a common theme with comments sections of all stripes strong and consistent moderation leads directly to good communities but this will upset libertarian dipshits who think losing the privilege to throw shit everywhere is crushing oppression
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah look at the way theyve taken over self at the moment they invade other subs and then wonder why people are sick of them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this elon musk business must be really irksome
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think thats their point conspiracy theorists werent harmless before pizzagate before that it was a bunch of anonymous fucking dickheads messing with peoples lives from behind a computer monitor over a spoopy daycare in salt lake city and before that it was the same conspiracy theorists harassing the parents of kids who died at sandy hook trying to get them to confess they were lying about their dead kids and before that it was isla vista the boston bombing september the list goes on thats not even getting into the golden days of conspiracy theories the black helicopters and fema death camps of the clinton administration conspiracy theorists have never been harmless fun there have always been true believers who will either harass those alleged to be involved or get a little more direct in their attempt to stop the conspiracy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rconspiracy has always been trying to ruin peoples lives because they believed their plight was righteous whether it was the boston bombings we did it reddit that day care shit a mother fucking day care guys they look after children or calling up grieving parents of a mass shooting to tell them that their children were child actors and demanding the release of videos showing their death so that they can call that video fake because who needs humanity anyway pizzagate isnt new to them theyre not doing anything different you just either didnt notice or turned a blind eye to how bad they were before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,smarts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why do you think i downvoted you i didnt as for td they do ban users sometimes but they go very far to say look we wouldnt have banned you but this is what the admins make us do they condone harassment and they are pathetic it is possible to support trump without sucking thedick
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that would be a good music subreddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my apologies for the baseless accusation i was wrongit mustve been a passerby eh whether they enforce banning reluctantly or enthusiastically i dont think matters so long as its being enforced there arewere trump supporters that arent all aboard le trump train and chess but whenever they tried to have open policy based discussion they were dismissed and lumped in with the all trump supporters are ist for supporting a ist candidate after many weeksmonths of having attempted conversations shut down or down voteddismissed by blanket statements they give up some stop trying to have discussions others end up joining td and upvote the shitposting as a fuck you to everyone else obviously there is a large portion that joined td just to shitpost and have no intention of having adult conversations that type of behavior exists in any circlejerky sub i just wanted to give perspective from my point of view and people like me politically rightleaning persons who wanted to have open discussions but gave up after being lumped in and labeled with blanket statements this is what plagues the us political system and those at the top want it to stay that way people from both sides of the spectrum using blanket statements and guiltbyassociation to dismiss opposing views if us citizens could move past that and have discussions without namecalling and other forms of suppression then we could actually compromise and get shit done definitely typed way too much and went on several tangents there thats what i get for drinking coffee this late i hope i made some sense spez spellingtypos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cheekystarlight this is fucking insane i love it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is hilarious i spend a lot of time on both subs but have never paid attention to the survivor polls guess i should start doing that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,holy shit im now known as the dude who tried to get the furries help love it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just remember that no matter how confused you feel the atlanta falcons blew a lead in the super bowl bruhhhh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the best part about this drama is how fun and inconsequential it is it feels so much more satisfying than a lot the other stuff on this sub mostly i think because everyone involved i hope know its just extended offseason banter maybe i feel differently because the eloe stuff for me has always been about playing a character and enjoying solidarity with other teams for being hated in their success as well as sharing sweeter banter thats not typically tempered with division rivalries
SubredditDrama,not_removed,feels nice to see some honest fun internet drama for the first time in way too long
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dae enjoy seeing all the drama coming out in the comments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one brave bronco fan reaches out to the furry community for their help shit how did i miss that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think ive ever seen a more succinct illustration of the last years of american politics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt realize the eloes alliance with the texans was so entrenched that theyd publicly admit their complicity with evil seems hatred of the colts truly is a potent force
SubredditDrama,not_removed,amazing write up but you need to really go deeper on the texans full betrayal of rungulates and subsequent evil internship in the eloe a tldr is basically the texans hate the colts so much that they offered full support to the eloe in exchange for taking taking the colts out the colts are in the same group as the texans rungulates seeing this as a betrayal they voted and decided the texans were suspended the texans not giving a fuck went full evil and are anti rungulate now see the texans banner for more details
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude this is so well done im not even a sports fan and i just spent two hours going through it all fucking go have a wank and a cookie and call it a day you earned it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some have taken to insulting members of the eloe expecting them to turn on one another but that will not happen we must unite against the great evil we must slay them one by one as they have done to our fallen comrades we must strike down the patriots followed by the packers then the cowboys the eloe will crumble and balance will be restored then we fight like hell but in the mean time team up on these fuckers before your team is targeted without the pats as a meatshield theyll start to sweat it and turn on one another
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a die hard texans fan and reddit shitposter i am loving every minute of our heel turn toward the dark side
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not only do they love their team but they have a hatred for the green bay packers that is really unmatched in american sports thats not true us lions fans hate the packers just as much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuck rnba can be so smug right now edit lot of dramalawyering going on in this thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude the machinations of reddit will be analyzed in future sociology and memeology classes just watch ill bet three fiddy that im right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i also think a lot of people take the name too seriously like because were called the evil league of evil were not above cheating really we just like being dicks over the success of our teams
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my favorite was when someone went to thedonald and posted asking for their help in voting for the patriots his goal was to trick them in to eliminating the patriots by only linking the poll so the donald who loves brady and the pats for its apparent support of trump would think they were voting for them to win it ended up having no effect but i applaud the creativity eloe reigns forever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a subscriber of rminnesotatwins and feel like i should clear some things up for everyone we were approached by a member of rminnesotavikings asking for support in defending the vikings believe it or not there are some of us who are fans of both teams i am i did not know nfl was doing a survivor poll so i was happy to find out and defend my favorite nfl team in return the representative from the vikings sub said they would be willing to help us out in the mlb poll again minnesotans helping minnesotans at this point it seemed like a stately thing to do in support of our teams at no point was it made clear that it would be the coalition helping is out at least not to us when eloe found out that the vikings sub was asking for support from the twins sub they decided to drop a nuke on us they felt that it was fair having fans from the patriots packers giants etc voting out a team that was just offering support to a team most of us were fans of already i keep seeing people say that the twins sub agreed to an agreement with the coalition but this is not true an agreement was never stated from the twins sub it was just some of our members offering support to an nfl team that we were fans of in fact when our sub was notified that eloe were targeting the twins in the mlb survivor poll the most upvoted comment said this im sure our like normal users will continue to not give a shit the twins never made an agreement we never voted in numbers those of us who did vote did so because we were vikings fans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is the best rsubredditdrama post i have ever seen also i dont know why but i am a detroit lions fan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,full disclosure ive been subbed to the eloe for a couple years as a packer fan this survivor poll has been a goldmine for drama and fun im looking forward to seeing how it plays out ive tried to keep my main post as neutral and fair as possible for srd rules if i have made any mistakes or you see any corrections please let me know this becomes more fun when the whole story is clear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,usuperfeds you should include the fact that the eloe targetted baltimore because its the anniversary of the baltimore colts leaving the city and that they are eliminating the cleveland browns cleveland browns left to baltimore in tomorrow they are also enacting a new devious plot to vote out the stragglers with the least votes forcing the smaller teams to actually turn the guns on themselves to avoid elimination devious really oh and theres a lot of popcorn at rcoatlitionagaisntevil the leader and most active mod of the site fucked up and split the vote completely making them look like disorganized shitheads
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn this is intense i thought the mets sub rustled some feathers when were voting out teams as a sub over on baseball survivor just glorious lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is the first time ive ever said boy im glad i found that relevant furry art
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the eloe is not only in possession of the one ring but several others this is the best line
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont leave out the facts that the vikings said they would help the twins win their poll if the twins helped the patriots lose in our poll how can you accuse the eloe of brigading rbaseballs poll when the twins brigaded our poll at rnfl and the vikings said they would brigade the twins poll tldr everyone is accusing the eloe of brigading but the twins did the same thing and the vikings said they would do it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uh can someone draw a picture to help explain this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,may evil forever reign and make comebacks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rnfl is like the king of offseason shitposting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,furries owo whats this suddenly this is a good thread sign me up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not a big sports fans but this is absolutely hilarious to me especially since im originally from minnesota
SubredditDrama,not_removed,using that hate as a shield the eloe realized as long as they vote as one that link appears broken feel free to use my humble to fill it in seems appropriate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is amazing thank you for the well written recap sports drama is so much better than politics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man this season of survivor is very exciting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is why underemployment in an economy is harmful
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is mental but hilarious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not only do they love their team but they have a hatred for the green bay packers that is really unmatched in american sports theyve only adopted the hate others were born and bred into it we know the vikings hate us but we cant really be bothered to feel anything about them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a major player in this ask me anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love football game of thrones
SubredditDrama,not_removed,evil will win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the greatest part about this is that as a participant in the event there is so much more happening below the surface that i cant even talk about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not only do they love their team but they have a hatred for the green bay packers that is really unmatched in american sports minnesotan here god damn im proud
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this has got to be the best post i have ever read
SubredditDrama,not_removed,drama for the drama god the following is an accurate account of the twins tears and how they tried and failed to intervene in the rnfl poll sure to elicit more salty replies vikings fans came into the twins sub and asked them to vote in the rnfl poll in favor of them and to vote out the patriots this was done in exchange for the promise of the vikings interfering with the rbaseball poll and voting out all nontwins teams starting with the mariners as seen if you help us well help you vote out the seattle mariners and the rest of the teams still left id like to point out that if done successfully this would have also screwed up the other rbaseball teams poll in addition to messing with the nfls one they were simply so inept and disorganized they couldnt get enough votes to sway the result but if youre going to try to whack someone you better damn well do it right this was seen by patriots and their alliance members bears cowboys steelers giants packers it hurts all of these teams to see the patriots voted off and so they didnt like the twins brigading our poll so would of course there would be some level of retaliation even though the vast majority did not the votes on rnfl have been in the tens of thousands so a few hundred chose to come back and retaliate which makes complete sense it was not promoted by the mods but a few hundred votes within should be expected in response tl dr twins fans brigade rnfl and a tiny minority of the coalition they target retaliates which skews the rbaseball poll because its smaller than ours so because theyre small theyre allowed to mess with the nfl poll a small guy twins instigated a fight with a big guy pats and allies and they got smacked do you dear reader expect the big guy not to punch back extra salty addendum the rbaseball mods chose to accept the result and eliminate the twins to much dismay with an asterisk added to their elimination in baseball fashion rather than invalidate it so their own mods kept them eliminated the revilleagueofevil mods then doubled down and said there would be no apology and threatened to retaliate against any future baseball teams that wanted to interfere with the nfl game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the fact that not a single person on that furry post made a reference to despite it being maybe the biggest furry thing made for furries that met popular acclaim in mainstream culture or at least lgbt culture and is literally about fighting bigotry in american fucking football is godamn maddening i was seriously hoping that this was gonna be some drama actually about that book series at the bery least i cant believe im the first person to make this fucking connection fucking kids have forgotten their heritage also this is the second post ive made about kyell gold today wheres my godamn check for this shitty viral marketing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,redskins they dont give a shit as per usual
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love reddit so much this is so funny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this reads like a south park episode unfolding its so utterly pointless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a bears fan we dont belong in the evil league of evil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought i was on rwritingprompts for a second
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only way this will be interesting is if the pats who hold a plurality on rnfl get voted out so that pats fan votes get split up why does the rest of eloe not realize what will happen at the end its pretty obvious that everyone outside of their club hates all of them but knows that the rest of the eloe hates the pats as well and will help the pats win in the end out of spite i know that my team has no shot in this from the start because literally no one cares about the bengals unless one of our players acts like a dumbass or they can make tired jokes about playoffs and the dalton line even if their playoff record as of late is terrible or nonexistent and their qbs are worse which is a lot of them catteambrotherhood was pretty much our only shot and the eloe will nuke it just like they did birdteambrotherhood oh god now the coalitionagainstevil is saying to vote for the giants wtf they know casuals will vote for the pats no matter what just eliminate that choice for them early so you can give them a new target rather than split the votes for dumb shit like the giants who cares about the damn giants that sub is definitely a psyops from eloe side note lol at rtexans new banner
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be honest im amazed the bears are a part of the eloe if it was the editionmaybe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is fantastic just an fyi rminnesotavikings is not private you just spelt it incorrectly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pol majors are going to study this like epidemiologist studied the blood plague in wow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you want good drama just wait until eloe starts turn on each other in the final
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess im just wondering why the bears are in the eloe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rbirdteams seems to have
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is great
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you left out a critical detail that part of the deal to secure twins fans votes the coalition against evil offered to rig the rbaseball survivor contest to eliminate all other teams but the twins that is a massive omission on your part
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all i want is patriots and giants to remain and giants to eliminate the pats i am a colts fan so my team is already gone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuck the pats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man i participated in the baseball version on behalf of the mets and shit got fierce though not as bad as this people are taking this waaay to seriously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,holy shit i thought that i was in rsubredditsimulator for a minute and was freaking out over the complexity of the bots post now that ive actually read this completely still not disappointed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,minnesota fans dont even know how to be evil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your hate as a shield link is wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a rams fan who wants to be involved in this im unsure what to do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,furies like all spirits that cause every negative emotion or furries like people in wolf suits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,patriots are main tanking giants are ot green bay bears steelers cowboys are dps houston is tagging along
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i officially dont care about this anymore other than to eventually use it as inspiration for some gotlevel dramatic novel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uphunnelcake best drama ive ever been apart of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you need to do a part two talking about turkgate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so i guess baseball and football are both in the off season because some of us fans of other better sports have more important concerns right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,excellent read im not at all surprised a bunch of front runners would want to continue to jerk each other off also the bears lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are furries just mascots without teams
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vote pats tomorrow because frankly the ravens are fucked today
SubredditDrama,not_removed,has there ever been a bigger group of ass grabbers than eloe the answer is no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so um why
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is amazing as a seahawks fan i mostly tuned out after the first round of voting and while there was some preliminary drama bubbling up i never would have guessed it to go so far as to cross not only into individual team subs but into a completely different sports sub so much fun especially since rnfl is usually so mild mannered when it comes to petty drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just let the vote run its course theyll turn on each other eventually collusion not so stable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your first link to rbaseball is broken
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the fact the patriots are still in proves what a complete clusterfuck this is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its rather cute that you think the vikings hate the packers more than the bears do if you wanna see some hate check out the bearspackers games in the earlymid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is amazing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a steelers fan yall gotta fuck off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,any updates thanks for this thread btw i have shared it with most of my friends and family
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive lost the game five times today because of this post man not happy not happy you hear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bro i love how seriously people take this lmaoooo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt bother reading it because im not a sports guy and your post is really long but im really curious as to why hades sent his furies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is just weird to me im not a sportsball person but i am a writer the conservative crybaby puppies whove been gaming the hugos voting system in exactly that way hey we can totally game the system by voting in bad faith in a bloc and force authors we like to win awards referred to themselves as the evil league of evil as well their leaders were all very proud of the membership shits weird
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just lost the game and so do you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to quote ym dad these kids need to get fucking jobs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,title made me lose the game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its been a lot of fun actually also the popcorn in the ops post is nice and salty d
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i visit rnfl daily but havent kept up with the survivor pool i will now hopefully my team isnt eliminated but teams from the eloe are archrivals with us edit oh no we are on the chopping block d
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not to mention the comments in this thread this is such a glorious and absurd diversion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the most fun ive ever had during an offseason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sgpopcorn this is the drama i sub for
SubredditDrama,not_removed,popcorn popcorn supplies will take days to recover from this kind of thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,minnesota tribal council
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id be in favor of daily updates on this a la sushileaks its only going to get stupiderbetter and oh yes i hope to contribute to the stupidity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is now my favorite sub so much drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its really brought the eloe together it used to just be about memes and hating on the bears but i feel a lot more comradery with the other membersexcept the giantsand packers and steelers and who cares about the bears i guess its just made me like pats fans more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is basicly game of thrones but better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was a pretty funny part of this whole saga i wanted to include it without hurting anyones feelings i said higher up but i just enjoyed the thought of a bunch of serious sports guys suddenly having their very serious poll have furries thrown into the mix with neither side really understanding the other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what are you going to do with your new found celebrity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so did any
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at least im not the only furry on rnfl lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope you clicked that last sentence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was a really good cover for the warriors blowing a lead
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly things got a little salty which is why i can post it here but i hope it will diffuse a lot of that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the texans are hated for their success huh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a nice change of pace
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its one of my favorite features of srd extra for errybody
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is there even a prize for winning the poll or something or is this just purely an ego thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no clue i missed that post too despite rfurry being the first subreddit my browser recommends when i type reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,weve noticed that too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,crazy how a two party system formed almost immediately
SubredditDrama,not_removed,texans whole thing is hilariously weird they were originally part of the ungulate teams with the colts dolphins broncos and others the ungulates joined the coalition against evil well the texans really fucking hate the colts and so traitorously switched sides to the evil league on the condition that they got to kill the colts also i cant believe what im writing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah the afcs really surprised me i kind of get the texans being ok with the pats due to coaching trees and shared players i did not expect everyone to hate each other so much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and were getting the httpsgooglimagesnwirjd out of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they went full brutus its glorious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,texans hate the colts so much this plus the general alliance of the pats and texans its been going on for years thanks to our mutual hatred of the colts and the shared players and coaches between the two teams theres a lot of back and forth even prior to this survivor pool between rpatriots and rtexans when rtexans saw they could further align themselves the patriots and ruin the colts they saw it as a winwin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i missed the change to their banner incredible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the best part is that we totally can keep getting away with it since the vote margin gets larger every round the patriots are further from getting voted off than they were when we started
SubredditDrama,not_removed,evil is evil lesser greater middling makes no difference the degree is arbitrary the definitions blurred if im to choose between one evil and another id rather not choose at all rcoalitionagainstevil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we must strike down the patriots cut off the head and the body will die someone in the eloe or even multiple members will flip on the rest of them and form a secret alliance and it will start with the patriots being taken out make the coalition great uh for the first time ever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some have taken to insulting members of the eloe expecting them to turn on one another but that will not happen we refuse to be turncoats eloe will come out on top
SubredditDrama,not_removed,evil will win because good is dumb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know that you believe that but you dont after games i mine the other nfcn for salt not to troll or anything but just because i like the taste during our great meme war this year i saw several posts across all subs about ftp i then saw a couple posts calling for people to stop talking about the packers and keep the focus on the team of the sub both the lions and bears responded positively to those threads and tried to keep the focus on each team respectively the vikings had a similar issue with ftp posts and a similar thread was posted calling for a stop to them the guy who posted it was downvoted and anyone who agreed with them was also it lend to a rather funny fight i wrote another drama thread about and that i linked in my original post some viking fans love to hate the packers that loving their own team is second place ive never seen lion of bears fans act like that and at least between packerbears fans a weird lovehate thing exists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you dont you guys rage at us get frustrated and might even feel a tinge of hate the vikings are being made entirely out of spite if they beat us in the nfccg theyd be appeased for like hours and then their entire lives going to back to sitting around and waiting until the next time we lose
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think the same factions could form in rnba maybe once the warriors were voted out but i think theyd just keep trying to vote the warriors out again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill bet three fiddy that im right oh god damnit i aint givin you no tree fiddy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we just like being dicks over the success of our teams and cheating
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats great wish i had seen it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the coalition never planned for your support either
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love how how it is phrased as dropping a nuke we have consistently put together over votes for the last three rounds the number of extra votes in the baseball survivor was dead on in line with the best fit curve of the growing popularity of the baseball survivor game in fact there were half as many total votes in the twins demise as there were in the round before im still not convinced more than a handful of evil league of evil even bothered to go into the baseball sub minnesota fans just seem like theyre so sad to have been knocked out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wont post private messages but we offered to take down our post if you took down yours and you refused and now you want to say that you did not want that post to be made and that you did not support it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dropping a nuke is a bit of an exaggeration if anything this is comparable to sending a small band of mercenaries to bolster an existing force for one battle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you brought yourself into this we had to get you out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think it was so much that the eloe thought the sub had agreed but rather used you an warning for other subs not to get involved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vikings slander vikings slander never trust a packer fan you fools
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what kind of packers fan thinks the vikings hate them the most i almost feel disrespected
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im pretty sure detroit hates yall more than minnesota lol im feeling some confusing rage as a minnesotan towards eloe even though i dont care about sports mostly cause our peeps are the butt of all the jokes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,go pack go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,leader and most active mod of the site fucked up and split the vote completely making them look like disorganized shitheads sleeper agent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im going to do a write up about the whole thing in rnfl when this is all over im unsure if enough popcorn will spawn from this for srd standards to merit another post but if it does ill see it ill edit to include the update you provided ill go into more depth in the future if this keeping being interesting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had no idea these were things
SubredditDrama,not_removed,listen the eloe totally brigaded but so did the vikings the tone of your post implies the eloe did nothing wrong but they did and they had a lot more firepower than the vikings both did something they should not have but the eloe did theirs with much more power not saying one is worse theyre probably even even though minnesota lost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while i was taking a nap did someone suddenly decide that two wrongs do make a right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i edited my post a bit to make that a bit more clear i linked to the eloes explanation of events
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think youre forgetting to mention that on that day having the patriots lose meant not having the vikings lose they were hoping to help their hometown team not get eliminated and clearly it didnt even have that much of an impact on the poll
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is a game being played that has only bragging rightseven thats debatable at stake on rnfl rnfl already had preexisting factions from stupid shit in the past that stupid yet hilarious shit has found a purpose and the biggest faction is swinging its giant user base to win something that doesnt matter and prevent people that hate them from having any joy during even the off season shit got too real and other subs from other sports were brought in and quickly struck down until only a light dusting of salt remained
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id almost forgotten
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like chances are good i wont live that shit down ahhh if only it had worked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how does it feel to be voted out of your leadership position in the coalition against evil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,by major player he means leader of a futile attempt at resisting evil luh you boo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think ive ever seen an attempt at vote manipulation this blatant that didnt come out of td
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but thats why its fun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes you do we take the entire history of programs into account not just their recent history
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the bears have the most wins all time most hof players all time second most championships all time third highest win percentage they got the packers kicked out of the nfl for a year so that they could sign one of their players they stole a championship from buffalo they released a rap single about winning the superbowl before the playoffs even started their credentials arent as recent but the bears absolutely count as evil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there seems to be two distinct groups of people in the eloe those that just want to watch the whole thing burn and those that think they can make a power play at the end to oust the pats and win the thing themselves for the moment the best move for the eloe teams is to keep the pats in it whether enough people want the pats to win just because its the most evil outcome remains to be seen i lean more towards the watch everything burn group
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it comes down to whether or not those spite votes come through that is the only chance the patriots have of winning but i dont see that regular votes that the patriots get every day changing come the end game i think the patriots are the first team eliminated from the eloe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its brought up often and its usually packer fans defending their inclusion the lack of the raiders is also brought up being evil isnt just about winning at one point in the bears history they got gb kicked out of the league so they could draft a player both teams wanted the bears then loaned the packers the money to get back into the league plus that team with buddy ryan and ditka was pretty evil i do wish the raiders were in it but they really hate the pats and go their own way most of the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks i fixed the typo but there were some rumors and discussion about the vikings sub going private for a period of time last nighttoday it looked like some survivor poll threads i saw previously were also gone but i couldnt confirm anything i was hoping mentioning it here would learn to some more info one way or the other but only people from the twins have really spoken up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it will have to happen before that i think it occurs the moment that eloe user rate is higher than nonmembers even after the loss of a fanbase we have finally reached the point where the eloe represents more of the rnfl fanbase than all other teams still in contention combined i think we are close to cannibalism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i linked to this in my post i think that makes it clear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if it comes down to nothing but eloe teams left the coalition plans to make sure the patriots win thats what the other eloe teams get for blindly following what the patriots say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,were too damn nice for evil the best i can give you is passive aggressive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vote for the patriots today
SubredditDrama,not_removed,houston is that new recruit that needs gear and will probably get one shotted by an unavoidable mechanic at some point in the fight but is still just happy to be there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,baseball starts in two days but yeah for the nfl this is just about the deadest point in the off season i think only july would be worse but the sub usually has a few other shitposty things going on that time of year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no just because a mascot looks furryanthro dont mean its furry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its because we have nice asses
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the offseason is dark and full of terrors
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for laughs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,should be fixed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ha there will be for sure when the game is over maybe one sooner there have been some minor developments but some stuff brewing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eloe dominated the whole competition at the very end they voted the giants bears out the last vote to see who made it to the finals was the patriots demise this was due to cowboys packers steelers coming together to vote them out yesterday was the vote for the winner while polls are about to close it seems like the packers are bagging it in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all of them are based on the tv series survivor basically the people with the highest votes gets kicked off that day the next days poll is all remaining team once it is final teams the one with the most votes wins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had no idea they called themselves that i read a ton of fantasysci fi and post in rfantasy a lot i had seen the whole sadpuppy stuff unfold and how they used bloc voting i think the attitude between both groups are pretty different i havent seen any anger from the sports guys just smug circlejerky stuff youd expect but i get embracing the evil theme when everyone says they hate you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not a sportsball person but i am a writer holy pretentiousness batman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i too am obligated to announce that i lost the game and i was on a roll too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i tried to get the best bits but there is just so much that to really enjoy it you have to start really following the whole thing i wanted to include the furry bit not to make fun of them but just because i find the juxtaposition of all these super serious sports guys getting support from a community on such an opposite spectrum hilarious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,quoth the raven nevermore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,redskins or lions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,welcome to srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it seems like almost every american sports subreddit has attempted something like this survivor game but the nfls version is the most fun cause there were already factions in place to take advantage of the voting scheme this is easily the most fun i have had in an off season watching more factions form and watching a party political system develop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuck you packers foreverbut that fight comes later much later eloe represent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i used to just hate the pats but now i appreciate that without them absorbing votes and without the league the steelers wouldve been gone in the first few days
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its true my other account is a member of the eloe and ive never felt such connection as these last few days
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rpatriots is also the biggest individual team sub on all of reddit our power is vast and immense without the rest of the eloe together we will conquer the reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,way less boobs tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if anyone hurt anyones feelings the furries hurt mine by not coming through for me in my time of need
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably the same as always fail to get weird fandoms to help other fans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe one or two the overwhelming consensus was football the american kind i dont know what that is or why i would care
SubredditDrama,not_removed,highfive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,omg its never going to end haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,along with the indians
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and that ku beat texas in football
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im waiting for the big bomb to drop when the rest of reddit catches wind and decides to participate this post may become the early genesis of that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they are just joining in for the fun we promised wed keep them around so long as they voted with us in exchange for eliminating the colts theyll get theirs before the final whats an evil league without evil minions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,texans arent eloe they are our lapdog
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im still trying to figure out how the bears fit into this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah its really stupid but thats why its so much fun we get to put on the guise of caring about a dumb little game and there are factions and targets its a blast but at the end of the day very few people actually care im not holding any grudges about antieloe teams about this or the people really minus a few its all in good fin and it disappears when you arent in the subs that are directly involved even outside of the thread in rnfl it doesnt matter there its all contained and its all in good fun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its an evil thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,straight ego
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im pretty sure it started out as a discussion in the evil league of evil as to who could be the most evil team to make win the competition the fact that we knew everybody hates the patriots with a blinding passion meant that they should probably win evil laugh evil laugh evil laugh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,outlasting a rival is the prize
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the evil league of evil has been around for years the coalition against evil was made the last week just for this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when this is all over i think im going to do a write up of the whole thing for rnfl i need to go over the texan thing more it really caught me by surprise and i wasnt aware of a lot of details that are pretty hilarious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vikings fan here we got axed yesterday i almost guarantee that if the eloe had come to us asking if we wanted to flip to the dark side in exchange for the packers getting voted out of us would do so part of it is hating your rival part of it is just having fun with this whole game thats materialized out of what seemed like yet another boring offseason shitpost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait dolphins are ungulates quick look at wikipedia holy crap dolphins are ungulates
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we have a distinct hatred for the colts plain and simple and the titans spawned from the ashes of our stolen oilers franchise so not much love there either the also love to wear throwback jerseys to the oilers which i cannot abide only team i dont hate is the jags they are that kid in class that has been in every class youve taken for years yet he never speaks and you dont know his name and he does consistently average on tests
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the nfcs all really hate each other as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they went full brutus roose bolton its a bit more accurate since they werent really chummy to begin with it was a connection but really they just were stuck together and were always fighting though subtly then the texans sent their regards
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it says its a private sub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,being evil is just so fun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the degree is obituary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the mods once tried to ban ftp posts that went over well i know youre a packer fan but your sentence at the end is just false and pretty ridiculous of course we would rather the vikings have success over the packers failing but if the vikes dont win then yeah the next wish is for the packers to lose
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah the classic idiotic analysis of the other side by someone firmly entrenched in their own side its amazing how this analysis can be applied to both politics and sports vikings fans want the vikings to win thats it but we also know we probably wont so we also take joy in the packers losing as they are our only competition in nfcn as it often helps us win the division how is that so fucking hard to understand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,listen dont get it twisted just because the bears are working with the pack doesnt mean we hate you any less than the vikings or lions the reason we are tolerating the pack is because we are in an alliance together its like how the us and the soviet union worked together during world war we hate you and want to see you gone but we are in an alliance that benefits us and we want to get rid of all our enemies first
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and if we have to choose the most appealing team it will be the spurs im a raptors fan and its pretty obvious that the spurs are the most noncontroversial team after golden state get voted out its the lakers next
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not true i am a part of a real life alliance of celtics and suns fans who fucking hate the lakers i dont know if it could ever end up like this tho this is war games
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the eloe somehow believes we were your secret weapon maybe that led to the confusion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt know about any twins activity till after they stated crying about losing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup made chart today doesnt look like eloe had much impact on the baseball vote
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im active in both subreddits and a patriots fan i was already participating in both games but the twins thing affected how i chose to vote
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it really is odd im only used to seeing this sort of crying about cheating from michigan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that may be true but i feel like if it was just a handful of eloe members there wouldnt have been a need to have an elol mod put out a defense post on their sub and im not that upset about being knocked out i just wanted to put out the perspective of a twins fan from the twins sub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what post the one where the vikings rep asked us to support our local football team
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you for clearing things up again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wwjjd what would jimmy johnson do post it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your metaphor isnt quite right either until eloe interfered the troops were firing at miami the eloe decided to lay waste to a team that was barely getting a dozen votes each day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep youre right i made another account pretended to be someone from the vikings sub and convinced myself and a few others to vote for a team we were already fans of lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay that makes sense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bears fan i like to imagine that the vikings envy the great bears v packers rivalry so much it makes them hate the packers more than any bear could
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who else do the vikings really have to hate unless perpetually battling for second place in the north really drives you he bears and lions are just fellow tortured souls fighting against the tide of titletown or do you hate the rams for playing in the city that took the lakers from you i can see that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the bears and pack have a great rivalry the vikings are beings of pure spite its not about which has a more storied past its about what the vikings are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,naaah just typical dolphin fan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,have you got the original idea from the packers fan saved it was in the initial interest thread with a back and forth with seahawks fans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well honestly youre right theyre both bad but this wasnt were going to mutually strike at each other this was one strike and one retaliation its just that our retaliation had way more behind it which im not condoning by the way but i mean if youre doing baseball stuff why would you seek out to piss off new york and boston that seems like a recipe for failure
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive kept the tone of my post as neutral as possible while also making clear i sub to the eloe in the comments i think the whole thing is hilarious and the whole thing should be celebrated while not letting anyone start taking it super serious and ruining that fun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the tone of your post implies the eloe did nothing wrong lets make it official the eloe did nothing wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but the eloe is meant to be evil its in our name
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just look at the numbers theyre posted right there on the top of the survivor pool in baseballs reddit evil league of evil had brigaded there would have been thousands more votes than there were the worry about votes cast in the baseball survivor pool about of those went to the twins these numbers are completely consistent with the slow and steady rise in the popularity of the baseball survivor game sure there may have been individuals from the evil league of evil who decided to go and mess with the game that mlb was playing but it was such a statistically insignificant number that i wouldnt call it brigading
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when you wrong a group with evil in their name twice im not sure what people expect to happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks but i understand the highlevel overview what i wanted was a diagram of who was allied with whom since that is the complicated part there seem to be a lot of teams and a few other groups involved in several alliances
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i made a nfl news aggregate some of the nfl and nfl team subs use is it worth sticking this on the homepage of httpnflbludgrcom or will it be over with fairly soon first time im seeing this being on the other side of the globe down under
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you are now tagged as survivor furry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a new poll was created because of eloe brigading i have the most votes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre speaking to the man that will lead the army to wipe out your kind have some god damn respect you prick once the patriots are gone you will be doomed cant hide behind your mommy skirts forever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is why i took it down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yet revilleagueofevil are the ones being accused of brigading and cheating
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that warms my heart subbed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ya why dont people seem to get that the other evil leagueers would be voted out the next day the pats are the shield for the alsohated cowboys and steelers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this will likely be the next great source of drama eventually there will come a time when certain members of our league vote in secret to undermine the patriots or fall victim themselves im a steelers fan and member of the eloe and i feel that we will have to make a move when theres fifteen remaining
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well the choices for the pats were lose the first day or two or make it to the final id rather get a podium finish then lose the first day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a good number of people are pissed at the eloe and have decided to vote in favor of the patriots to spite the other eloe teams
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they really hate the pats its a shame they cant tuck all that hatred away somewhere and move forward
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think people were getting confused by accidentally going to rvikings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,weve had majorities the last two days
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for any team to flip enough of their own people to make a difference in the votes theyd have to announce it publicly as soon as that happens they know theyre fucked makes no sense for the eloe to break up until the final
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not really unlike post what you linked to does not explicitly state that the cae was openly admitting to gaming rbaseballs poll in exchange for votes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we wont care
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i still fail to see where the blindly following occurred the pats are the only team sub that has yet to kick out a division rival
SubredditDrama,not_removed,were well aware they cant do it without us it will be our victory as well besides most of our teams would be gone already otherwise anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont you see convincing a bunch of patriots haters voting for the patriots out of spite is the evilest outcome of all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh i stopped voting when our sub got voted out and i probably wont vote again unless the packers are the team ftp
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reminds me of flanders i pride myself on being a good host so im obliged to offer you a beer but im so darn mad its going to be mostly head
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you triggered i was being entirely sarcastic and imitating but you just piqued my interest
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so is the regular season
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thx do you know what became of the texans did they make it to the near end w the rest of the eloe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just found it a weird coincidence vox and hoyt were especially vocal about the eloe moniker
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh just trying to explain the context im coming from most people dont know who the sadrabid puppies are if they arent in the community somehow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and i love how most of the responses in the furry post were lackadaisical at best they were like yeah thats cool but why do i care again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a furry i do find it hilarious that they tried to get the furry fandom involved in this nfl thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey am a furry who is also big football fan we exist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it certainly is a community on the spectrum
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you forgot content like httpsstreamablecommpjks from user johnbrousseau
SubredditDrama,not_removed,great write up man enjoyed your analogies too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,have you ever watched survivor its a common strategy for someone who is a threat to ally with the most hated were the most hated and have zero chance of winning this game but we can certainly help another lesshated team win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ravens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah srd is almost exclusively agendaposts at this point too many people giving too many fucks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its such a strange and wonderful accident that those nfl subsubs already existed this never would of taken off without factions already in place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpiimgurcomgikpysggif
SubredditDrama,not_removed,our power is vast and immense without the rest of the eloe bit of an overstatement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if rbrowns still does boobs for browns this year that would probably change
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oddly the same amount of dicks tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,manboobs tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry its not personal a lot of us just dont care
SubredditDrama,not_removed,totally not what i would do id go out in a blaze of glory in vegas you know coke hookers the whole shebang
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well you tried you at least made the game waaaaay more enjoyable with it people may forget the results but people will always remember that furries got involved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why am i not surprised by this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ya im waiting to see evilleagueofevil treanding
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you guys think this is fun i guess for me i just feel like im trying to get a democrat elected in wyoming or a republican in hawaii
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol reminds me of tv shows like big brother and survivor where they have the players that latch on to groups but you know they are the bottom of the totem pole and will be the first to go when all the outsiders are voted out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we prefer the term henchmen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah we are just the sidekick mercenary yall bought with all that superbowl money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really nothing recent lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theguise the guise you return to the sub and tell me that the blood sweat and tears our mean put in trying to act concerned about the inferiors is a fucking guise its like i dont even know you brother you are lost to me now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh this whole thing is gonna hit the fan once the eloe teams have to start backstabbing each other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the texans were approached by the eloe to vote out the colts and of course we said yes if it actually happened and were considering their offer ungulate teams saw we were going to do it and nd threatened to kick us out once the eloe was actually serious about voting out the colts day and the ungulates were serious about suspending us we just went full evil there was never much diplomacy from the ungulates or coalition just a fuck you for considering being evil so at that point we just embraced it and rtexans has always been a fairly memey and off topic subreddit so the mods have allowed it to take over more than some other subreddits have and everyone has gotten more involved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,feel free to use any of the memes i created in your post write up i believe the cull the colts one was the first to use the texans logo and they give a sense of the relation we share with them round round round httpiimgurcomfktvhodjpg round httpiimgurcomammrfyfjpg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not really all that surprising they want the colts and titans gone and the eloe said theyd give it to them most of the wins in the survivor game is just getting the team you hate more out first
SubredditDrama,not_removed,keep notes so you dont forget
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we just really hate the colts there was a guy that posted the most used words weektoweek throughout the season pretty much all year the top words were fuck the colts that and something to do with brock sucking balls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just poke through rungulateteams the past few days and follow any links you see to rtexans that should give you a good overview
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this needs to be a book honestly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a texans fan i can say that in the eloe there is only one team we hate not in the eloe there are two teams we hate including our biggest hatred its simple math
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can add the texans getting temporarily banned for betraying the colts by the ungulates and then responding with a new banner
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats fair
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the classic narcissistic packers fan mentality the world is all about them so of course their main competition only cares about them losing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean i take joy in the packers losing just for the sake of them losing but thats mostly because the majority of my family lives in wi half my friends are packers fans and im an asshole
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not always about who is the most noncontroversial though i mean hell they just voted out the colts and hardly anyone cares that much about the colts lately if these coalitions formed in rnba they might decide to vote out a nice guy team because it threatens them in the future the steelers are trying to get the eloe to vote against the browns soon because the browns are the nfls sweet but slow grandpa
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id vote the clippers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt know this was a thing im a celtics fan and loved those steve nash led suns teams in the neat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they werent the secret weapon nick swardson was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i told them you guys werent but the rumor seems to still be spreading
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had been trying to get people to understand a best fit line for the growth of their survivor game but not many people seemed to understand it without a really pretty graph oh well thanks for sharing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a weird way to spell patriots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,considering that some subs were discussing getting revilleagueofevil banned for brigading a defense post was kind of necessary either way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the one where he offered to have him and his football allies rig the baseball poll so the twins would win yes that one youre okay with football fans rigging the baseball poll when its in your favor
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the evil subreddit loves it delicious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess your right then maybe its more of a situation where a foreign leader is believed to be interfering with a war he is not apart of but an ally is as a result he is assassinated as a warning to other nations not to interfere in the war any further normally this may be a reason to declare war except the opposition is so overwhelmingly large and your potential allies are so apathetic that it would be absolutely stupid to try
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you misread my post or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,correct and yeah i can almost see that but i think our recent struggles have really embittered some of our fanbase the circle jerk over ftp on our sub is real i think some people actually masturbate to their hatred of the packers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i always thought vikings fans hated themselves the most
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not necessarily the vikings but as a minnesotan the blackhawks fuck the blackhawks they dont even deserve a capital b to be considered a noun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for a while we were pretty bitter about the saints somewhat overtaking the packer hate i dont think anyone really hates them more now then theres pockets of us that hate recently good teams theres some that hate historical rivals that beat us on big games but the one biggest unifier is the packers for sure
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can almost see that a one sided rivalry fuels some pretty negative feelings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i do not going through earlier threads is proving needle and haystackish
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a fair writeup the only error i see with it is that you didnt really explain the eloe is teaming together out of necessity for survival if they dont work together they would all have been eliminated early in the game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly the best alliance involves the texans and the evil league the texans were grouped in with a very hated rival colts so they joined the evil league on the condition that they got to play the part of brutus and stab the colts in the back
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im going add this to the main thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fitting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry about that i was in our sub trying to convince people not to mess with your poll
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at this point i feel the game is already won by the evil league of evil even if one of minnesotas many desperate plans had come through and they had knocked us out the goals of evil is to spread misery throughout our enemies lives maybe this game will garner enough attention that a celebrity will take notice and put their thumb on the scales maybe the entire league that actually outnumbers us significantly will start to pay attention and assert their will at this point the taste of tears and salt are so great if i dont wake up tomorrow i will have lived a happy life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i find this belief to be somewhat unfounded even if the pats are voted out if anything the votes would get distributed more thinly among the remaining players the pats make for a convenient visual meat shield but i dont know how much their participation is preventing other teams from getting knocked out especially since its clear the pats fans the biggest fan base are clearly mobilized and motivated to participate and there is no rule barring their continued voting after elimination
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you do realize that even if the patriots were eliminated they can still vote and unlike other groups eloe members would keep voting after elimination just for the evil of it with each vote we grow stronger with each vote yall fall further into familiar irrelevance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when you guys get around to doing something ill worry okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eloe was literally telling people to use vpns to vote more than once then justified it by saying well were evil so we do evil things
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt that exactly why the eloe exists in the first place whatever the teams whatever the sport there will always be that group that draws the ire of everyone else because they have too many shiny things if you cant beat them disparage them becomes their motto thus groups like the eloe form up to celebrate that no matter what they do or say they will always be hated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i definitely think the cowboys are going to be the next target after the pats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the packers sub made a private enclave to discuss future strategy the jags also made a private sub before anyone else im hoping they come out of left field with something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah the classic jury move from survivor the show you stabbed me in the back so boldly i have to give you the money the coattail riders can suck it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill add you link to my post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree with your point about blindly following but disagree with your point about division rivals the patriots have no rivals in their division since brady took the helm in theyve won the afce every year but two one of those years was when brady was out the whole season with an acl tear no other division has close to this level of sustained dominance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,browns fan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,le sportsball huehue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look at those nerds taking their hobby way too seriously who could get so excited from something so weird i know bro ill never understand sports fanshows my tail
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but out of position tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we may be a small percentage but damnit were here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,purgethebirds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as long as the steelers dont win idgaf what happens the bengals definitely arent going to win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,patriots die day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is why i hate the pack more than any other team in the league combined you truly are deserving of the title of evil brother
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and the petty infighting begins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one browns fan said that boobs for browns would be cancelled if they were voted out jokingly i believe they are in the running for tomorrows chopping block by eloe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if it was soccer he could have thrown in a bunch of zabivaka and more would have participated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not a bad idea maybe i can invite my furry friends oh wait i have none
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt that the raiders plan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i suppose ive always been more of the jester than the king huh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly i shouldve seen it coming
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rcoalitionagainstevil trended on the colts day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its fun because it is inconsequential like i said no baggage associated with politics or meaningful contests ride with it try to win the meme war look at new strategies like confusing people on what the target of the day is go all out get evil to me it reminds me a lot of how twitch plays pokemon felt the way factions just came from nearly nothing and people just ran with it constructing new tribal identities for shits and giggles the coalition are the underdogs theres some prime meme game in that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or valued allies saints and texans are the protectorate of evil maybe jags and panthers too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,try halas and co did some pretty evil stuff back in the day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see thats exactly the beauty of the game we get to play this out whenever we like jsut turn it on and off and its a blast eloe forever temporarily
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not really backstabbing the major consensus is that once were the final we can take any means necessary to try and win itll just be a dissolution of the alliance with a guaranteed evil victor
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the nice thing about being a part of a league with evil in its name twice is that you can pretty consistently expect evil from your comembers evil only bands together when each member perceives it to be to their own benefit for now we all benefit from voting as a block because otherwise wed be the first set of teams out we all know where this is going though there can be only one and we are all explicitly evil i think the last rounds or so are going to be really fun to watch assuming no upsets as it becomes eloe and a handful of allies will the rest of the league band together against the pats can the pats exploit rivalries to ally a team eg bears or packers first will it just devolve to chaos probably the pats best chance should be interesting to watch how things break down edit just to be clear pats fan here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people on the outside seem to think so but we in the eloe dont particularly care about winning so long as everyone else has to watch someone from the league win it all if i can have days of i will be happy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive seen some subs already making private subs for strategy discussions post eloe im trying to stay neutral despite my eloe roots at this point but the public strategy discussions in the sub seem to indicate plans to keep the game interesting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly i was a little concerned that when i stickied the post declaring intentions that people would take it seriously and get upset with me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and honestly despite being in the afc most pats fans have a soft spot for the texans i cant speak for other eloe teams though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks having links makes it so much easier im trying to get people from all the subs involved to send me things for a more complete write up when its all over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also remember purgethebirds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the colts were a hilarious sacrifice to guarantee the faith of the texans in the evil league of evil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuck the colts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre a strong contender for leastlikeable team flop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id do a write in vote for the warriors again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,welcome to the club we call it desertboston for life or dbfl but its a placeholder name our motto however is set in stone lakers suck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nick swardson seriously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im eloe and i never believed that at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that makes sense but they still took ownership of their actions in that defense there wasnt an apology or an understanding of having gone too far it was only in the comments where i saw people say that they shouldnt have done it meh it doesnt matter they are evil and they are damn good at it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he never offered his allies to help us i stated that above show me specifically where he said his allies what he said in his post was that the vikings sub would support us and as i also stated above there are many of us who are fans of both
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nobody in rcoalitionagainstevil had anything to do with the twins and the rbaseball poll vikings fans who are also twins fans were invited to help
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is perfect thank you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,agreed i feel like some of them are more packer haters than bears fans our hate of the pack might be the thing that kept us together during the great cutler schism of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean thats the real secret packers fans are just jealous that vikings fans hate the vikings the most
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kind of like a patsbills rivalry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill send you the link dont worry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,forgot i was in the chain
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats everyones motivation for everything in this affair isnt it thats the moving force right the survivor game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyve done everything we asked and more the texans are evil bros now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also the texans are the patriots south bill obrien as head coachoc romeo crennel as ahc mike vrabel as dc last year their quarterbacks were brian hoyer and ryan mallett
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like how did the vikes not get chris kluwe or fred smoot involved both of whom are users and actually ocassionally post smoot is even a mod of rkirkcousins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i believe it was an eagles fan that got caught using bots to vote
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you say that like the logic isnt crystal clear the lesson is seen time and time again evil will always triumph because good is dumb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,using vpns on an offsite poll does not violate reddit rules
SubredditDrama,not_removed,surprisingly the packers have been drawing the second most votes after the patriots but it isnt a huge margin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is just a reminder to fuck the jets
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you are seriously underestimating how much hatred there is between the jets and the patriots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,both times the pats were tied for the best record but needed a result from thee jets in order to win the tiebreakers stupid jets failed to comply
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the san diego chargers of los angeles
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dunno i think its funny sorry if it hurt your feelings in some fashion jesus im not sure why youre memeing at me over it but you do you i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,am furry cant follow this drama can confirm everything above is true
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i said this is my post but its kinda crazy considering the most acclaimed proffessional furry writer kyell gold has writen a very popular series about american football which won a bunch of awards and a lot of them not furry specific awards so im pretty surprised there are not more people who care about football there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,read
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you vote
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actually we are about and the eloe in total is about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what they said before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if it helps the beer and cheese combined with the stress of winning most of a game choking and then winning with a hail marry will kill us early but at least we will die having seen our team win a few superbowls unlike the vikings fans whose hated in their veins may grant them long life but still never long enough to see a championship win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes i havent checked the nightly strategy thread yet but my understanding is they will be up soon
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vegas the american kind why do we care
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not the worst fate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i remembered some of the presuper bowl shenanigans of the bears after i wrote that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just like my giants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sick its the theoretical highlander immortal alliance strategy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so long as those filthy chicagoites dont win then ill be ok
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats precisely it as a steelers fan id love to be the last team standing however my only real goal is for all the last teams to be from the eloe im sure most of the eloe feel the same way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ya im a pats fan as well my assumption is that someone will try and be super evil and kill the pats a few days before its just eloe members always bet on the circlejerk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im part of the eloe pats fan im aware of that but there will still b those wishing to be the winning team
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as the person on the literal opposite side of the spetrum of this mod of rungulateteams ive been concerned of that this whole time too its all good fun to me lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we at the eloe appreciate your support and spicy memes im a little sad that my sub has been down playing it a bit its not like theres shit else to do in the offseason right now i mean one of our top posts is about jay cutlers naked ass right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they are looking after big vince for us and a good chunk of their coaching staff are expat legends like izzo and vrabel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a giants fan i certainly do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no problem your write up was fantastic ill make sure to keep you updated with the other ones ill be creating throughout each round
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and the browns are because we went with purgethebirds strategy first and wanted to eliminate the browns after the ravens so theyd be eliminated twice ravens used to be browns before they relocated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he is a huge vikings fan a few of us tweeted at him for a few days hoping to retweet the poll saying vote patriots he has over followers we would have won if he had retweeted did the same with josh duhamel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought the secret weapon was misleading rthedonald users saying vote for the patriots and we need your help beating those vikings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and many of us in eloe are fans of nontwins baseball teams whats your point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the coalition was mentioned and explained in the post they should have known that what they were doing was entering the war between the coalition and the evil alliance if they plead ignorance then that just makes them stupid voting out the patriots means voting out the evil league of evil if they were not aware of that then they werent paying attention to their own post because it explained that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i hope they do too thatd be a lot of fun maybe we can even have shady partnerships and alliances and eventually have our own srd thread well have to find another weird group to pull in for no apparent reason that makes no sense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the difference is the other teams at least had a viable path to victory whereas before the game even started everyone was talking about how the eloe teams were going to be the first out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they also took our sweet vince and took care of him we love them for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont forget larry izzo coaching teams
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who said it did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my little bit of bragging is that im one of the four people kyell dedicated the first book to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of course
SubredditDrama,not_removed,years ago on this day the baltimore colts left baltimore today the ravens leave the survivor pool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,patriots fan here were surprised weve made it past day but we would never have done it without our allies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot of people that dont vote pats would pick them as their second choice pats are already the choice every time i think the added votes from the ranked choice would push them over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the thinking was to vote out the browns after the ravens thus voting out the browns twice in two days to be particularly evil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fucking savage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly theyve prolly got the best chance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,feel the same way about you infernal cheddar heads
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we at rtexans encourage visitors to check out our flair game its top notch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats pretty funny i saw some guys suggesting tweeting players considering the boston fans out there that might be a dangerous gambit i dont know who the packers would havelil wayne and kevin from the office
SubredditDrama,not_removed,josh duhamel duhamel the poker player
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats actually pretty awesome
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the plan was as multifaceted as it was ineffective
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the vikings fans who are also twins fans wanted to see the twins do well in the rbaseball poll thats it thats all twins have nothing to do with the coalition and the coalition has nothing to do with them except for their interests aligning for the vikings vote you guys took it too far
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh my bad i thought you voted twins because elol told you to i didnt realize you were already taking part in the mlb survivor game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god i fucking love this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why would you expect them to immediately understand the nuances and convoluted power balances in our day old survivor poll
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe more like a patsbills rivalry if the bills had an outside shot to make the playoffs every now and then those bills fans have some hate let me tell you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that actually inspired the eloe coalition some seahawks mentioned how the pats go first and a random gb fan said offhandedly that the eloe teams up and gets rid of everyone before during it out he started the whole affair to be honest
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is very impressive and i am much too jealous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,me too for the eloe approved teams broncos suck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think that like the show survivor it will get really interesting when the eloe has to go after itself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im reminding everyone why the pats dont have seven rings right now and counting on patriotshate to spur us to victory
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think they have the second best chance its between them and the niners but the packers really fucking hate the bears and they have quite a large number of users
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i really appreciate all the ricks and mortys is it in reference to your owner
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we have silly story time i was at a catholic service an hour north of greenbay a few years ago during season and mass started at one hour before kickoff the dick head priest ran his homily speech fucking minutes longer than normal saying we should spend more time focusing on gods message instead of overpaid athletes i know some of you are hoping to hurry home but lets take time to focus on whats really important twothirds of the attendees had jerseys on and a few left early to be home in time for kickoff as he blatantly ran service past kickoff its crazy how rabid it is for packer fans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they do have paul ryan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is wayne not a saints fan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mean the las vegas security professional
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my favorite type of plan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the twins fans that voted in the nfl survivor game were not already taking part in the nfl survivor game if they were there would have been no point to caes post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cannot wait for brady and belicheck to retire oh man the revenge that will ensue will be glorious the patriots may reign supreme right now but know your time is short friend unless youre not a pats fan in which case uh lol you didnt win the superbowl nerds no im not creative bite me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes thats when things will get interesting i fully suspect thats when us pats fans get the axe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they dont have seven rings because its not yet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but which one will be able to acquire the ne and dallas voteblocks will they even vote as blocks within the final
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no clue id have to ask the flair master
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i lived in gb for a while and while i never went to church myself i heard of several churches that moved their services early enough so that people managed to get home for kickoff football is serious business in green bay if you ever find yourself in green bay on gameday the city is a ghost town not that its a bustling metropolis normally but still
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wayne is a brett favre fan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what cae post the only post we received was from a representative of the vikings sub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sure some alliances will form in the final at the beginning which will likely lead to the packers and pats being ousted first from there i assume a free for all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the post that was planned in the cae subreddit either way what is the difference between twinsvikings fans voting for the vikings when they previously only participated in mlb survivor and red soxpatriots fans voting against the twins when they previously only participated in nfl survivor
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not sure a singular comment counts as an eruption

SubredditDrama,not_removed,i miss fartbongo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seems like youre too old usually people are married by that age do you know how i know youre
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jokes on him cuz i just turned today and am not dating hahahaha fuck your average statistics sob
SubredditDrama,not_removed,young people that rush into marriagehave kids as fast as possible weird me out a bit nothing wrong with dating at etc theres nothing wrong with being happy and independent lol my two cents tinder has always felt like the worst of all the dating services out there okcupid has been pretty good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,even if most people are married by its probably still less than that still leaves you with millions and millions of single people above the age of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jeez id hate to see what theyd say about my mother being on tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would love for someone to make a graphical representation of the sliding scale of what someone considers old based on their age cause i guarantee that no one over the age of thinks that is old
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how old is too old for tinder asking for a friend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reminds me of a guy i know who thinks that he has no chance of finding a girlfriend because according to him at you have to be married and cant have fun dates anymore no movie theatres ice cream it must be boring restaurants and plays or something i dont know where he got those ideas also he thinks women at that age automatically want babies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only right now and being seems young to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sweet summer child imo dating is the best between the mid people are usually more confident have experimented enough with fashionmakeuphairstyles that they know what looks best on them and actually have money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,idk who you are but you smell like crumpets and tea i hear your armor clanking dead serious now im not american neither english so i really have no idea what the kid meant here someone care to explain edit in case anyone missed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh great im old now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,long until i have to get divorced
SubredditDrama,not_removed,suddenly shes a mean and hateful person when she points out his assumptions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aint nobody getting married before they are well into their you gotta enjoy your life thats what himym taught me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,funny when my aunts ask me the same question its like that reddit feed come to life except not really because my answers are far snarkier and less judgmental
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some things youll never understand until you get to that age im and in a long term relationship we dont plan on ever getting married maybe itll last maybe it wont the point is if you force yourself to follow a timeline thats a surefire way to end up unhappy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of my several friends who got married in their twenties only couple was still married by the time they were
SubredditDrama,not_removed,never been on a date but sure plenty of people over are dating
SubredditDrama,not_removed,weak troll cant believe it got posted here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he sounds like a rniceguys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuck im nearly now what do i do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just turned i have a feeling im gonna get these questions soon
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not yet and i dont date because its not affordable for me drops mic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you seriously that fucking dense and socially unaware get fucked you absolute muppet i just found my new favourite insult ♥
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im in my late and single going back to school to hopefully get my life back on track after my early didnt work out so well and i feel fucking old and depressed over it all a lot of the time i mean intellectually i know im still young in the grand scheme of things but damn it doesnt feel that way a lot of the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im have been with so for years this jan still not married but what annoys me more is the bad statistics discussion going on an average does not require a split of the population thats true for a normal or bell curve distribution but has nothing to do with the definition of an average if of people get married at age and at age then the average will be the median age people get married is probably around since theres bound to be some year old tying the knot and the mode age is probably its right tailed data
SubredditDrama,not_removed,idk who you are but you smell like crumpets and tea i hear your armor clanking bahahaha thats brilliant that person is definitely just fucking with these people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,itt heaps of late twenties to mid thirtysomethings hangout in srd not me though just saying not in the age bracket and never been on tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well that made me feel old
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i met my wife when she was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good reason not to get married if you eventually end up with someone like that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my partner is nearly ill be sure to tell him that he can never break up with me now without condemning himself to a life of eternal batchelorhood
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my dad wasnt married by thirty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people are usually married by that age whew lad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gotta be a troll
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dating at age good grief im in my only collegeage redditors would make an issue out of something like that the is nothing its when youre at your peak whether its socializing career or academics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah the ol i was trolling backtrack
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im why not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pretty sure all this internet stuff is only supposed to be used by people the same age as me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,clearly this person is either or lives in a rural community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we all seem to agree that when youre being sounds really old and thats probably whats going on here but just from a factual perspective in the us the average age of marriage is isnt even close to being an unusual age to still be dating
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they took the troll bait
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from man seeking woman an amazing show on fx
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im my boyfriend is weve been dating for almost six years and arent in any hurry to get married ill have to let him know that my request to postpone engagement is now null and void since a teenager on reddit says were too old to date
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are year olds on tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this this is like when a year old finds out his year old uncle still plays video games or that his year old aunt still goes to bars honorable mention to that oftreused shower thought where teenage you is disappointed in how often adult you sleeps in a bed with someone whom they often have sexual relations with but amazingly you guys just sleep instead of fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and a few years after that people are usually concealing their syphilis and fighting crime they are falling behind ill bet they dont even have an origin story
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair this was also the case for my friends that never left the small town they were raised in they all got married in there mid i moved san francisco oakland ca people get married late and or have little tolerance for shit spouses here so theyre also comfortable with divorce you can date until the day you die here edit can date
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reddit is pretty much all how think the world works thats what makes it funny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im and this is my second marriage but i have a child from that previous marriage at sooooo i guess i match up to a yr olds version of trailer trash idk there isnt exactly a set time to do anything especially college i see old dudes get that treatment a lot when i was getting me degree
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol seriously that was my first thought
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my thoughts exactly just a dumb kid who doesnt know anything about relationships marriage or adulthood
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know i think is too generous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im only but i like to get things done early how are you for saturday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i could use a tax break
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can i see your bank statements before deciding thx
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think we missed the boat we gotta sign up for spinsterhood and go collect our cats or something or if youre a guy i think you gotta get an expensive sports car and dye your hair jet black and hit on young girls im not really sure what the stereotypes are for single guys as they get older
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill marry you for the sex cooking tax breaks and split bill payments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i turned this year am single i probably should be dead at this point hmm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sup bb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im and my boyfriend allows me to marry you see you at city hall
SubredditDrama,not_removed,want some sweet canadian citizenship
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i turn next year since were already essentially dead might as well make it legally too i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i turn next month help me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in months definitely cant be seen dating then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,was my most fun year just saying d
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im you have a vagina if so im down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,happy birthday regardless of date status
SubredditDrama,not_removed,happy birthday stranger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,happy birthday 🎂
SubredditDrama,not_removed,happy birthday i hope you have a good day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,happy birthday you want to open the present
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no worries broham you do you the best part of being completely single is doing whatever you want whenever you want so make sure youre fully taking advantage of that not just the short term of playing video games until in the morning just go on short term tripa and stuff the freedom is phenomenal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats because it wasnt intended to be a dating service it was a hook up service people treating it like a dating service is why theres so much confusion and disappointment on it people coming in with completely different expectations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seconding okcupid met the woman of my dreams on there really it makes sense answer hundreds of questions and message people with high match ensuring you have a lot of common ground from the get go i read countless reviews and do tons of research before buying anything but dating youre supposed to just dive in based on initial attractiveness and hope you share all kinds of major life goalsdecisions very thankful i made and account on there and she messaged me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you just made me terrified that ill still be dating at
SubredditDrama,not_removed,happy and independent im hoping to marry before i turn but i think a major problem people have is thinking they or worse their spouse cant be those things while in a relationship just because marriage means compromising a lot in life it shouldnt mean dependence for selfworth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my two cents tinder has always felt like the worst of all the dating services out there okcupid has been pretty good tinder is awesome in that it requires both parties to make a move too bad the mechanism and the app itself is so superficial okc is awesome in the right places in the world in some cities ive had people lining up in other countries theres like three people signed up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,young people that rush into marriagehave kids as fast as possible weird me out a bit working for the courts has only reinforced my sense of bewilderment at the idea of marrying super early oh yeah just wait until youre ready to retire but need to dig around for a divorce from a half century ago for social security those are fun said noone ever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,iirc in western europe the average age for a first marriage is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the idea that people are married by the time theyre is old fashioned thinking these days that happened a lot in the baby boomer generation where people met their spouses in high school and married shortly after nowadays with careerfocused people less of a stigma about dating multiple people and traditional families being less of a priority first marriages after people turn is now the norm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,depending on the study you look at between of of adults age have been or are married that number increases as the age range goes up with around of adults age or older having been or currently married
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also theres the people who just got out of their first marriages gettin on tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im and still go to bars my pickup line is hey youre really cute is your mom single i was tempted to get an express tshirt that said your mom will love me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh god im older than your mother and im on tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh god im older than your mother wait i could almost be your grandmother im gonna go hide under the bed now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had a very strong conviction when i was a teenager that i was going to commit suicide when i turned because its all a downhill slide into decrepitude from there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the only adults who think is old are people who recently turned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i met my exwife she was and thought was old
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the inverse of the half your age plus seven rule is the oldest person you would consider dating so age
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im and ive always considered to be the cutoff between old and young
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i remember goofing around with my sister and we turned our age preferences all the way up there were plenty of people who were or even and most of them had fullyfleshed out profiles being a straight woman i only saw men so out of curiosity i asked my guy friend to turn his age preference up and sure enough there were also plenty of women although not as many as the men so yeah i dont think theres a hard age cutoff for using tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,movies theaters and plays arent great for first dates because youre watching something in silence for hours instead of interacting with each other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,implying restaurants and plays are boring fite me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair the last part does happen more but its far from universal but to the rest of it he may just be making excuses to himself to avoid getting out there i know i did it often when i was depressed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sad your friend thinks plays are boring clearly he hasnt seen the right plays
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and actually have money i like your optimism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and actually have money you dont know my life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mid and early so millennials actually have money haha youre funny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and birth control too they also are more likely to have their own place and not deal with terrible roommates
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and they arent afraid to post bussy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sweet summer child imo dating is the best between the mid it keeps being good after as well better in fact most people know more about what they want and are less afraid to ask for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably trying to call them a white knight usually anyone with any sort of basic human decency is either a white knight or an sjw
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes calling them a white knight i think
SubredditDrama,not_removed,me too thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats fucked up is i remember being and acting like being is so old i suck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pretty sure at you should be widowed already thats old as heck dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what himym taught me weird it taught me to try and bang girls you are friends with because it will make for a cool story later
SubredditDrama,not_removed,married in our twenties now where the fun in that drake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah his post history makes it obvious as fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uhm die alone obviously i mean youre youve got what years left
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know how they didnt get you already must be a malfunction run runner
SubredditDrama,not_removed,please remove the username ping
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont tell him that it might make him leave you it sounds great
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you sound like such a mean nasty hateful person please dont talk to me again when its in response to a comment like this that saying may not carry as much weight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay but like actually read what shes replying to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a human being
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i read that line as a slightly more complicated way of saying lol ok there guy i didnt really look into it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a year old girl got called out in overwatch last night by a kid who said youre and you still play video games its not like i work days a week or anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,year old me would be disappointed to hear of year old mes masturbation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honorable mention to that oftreused shower thought where teenage you is disappointed in how often adult you sleeps in a bed with someone whom they often have sexual relations with but amazingly you guys just sleep instead of fuck oh man teenage me would be so disappointed that im not having sex like twice a day every day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reminds me of the constant questions on raskmen along the lines of why might you turn down sex or men who turned down sex why like its some kind of unthinkable act
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my cousins year old son was floored that he had someone to talk to about vidya at our christmas party besides his dad anyway i told him about star citizen so his dad probably hates me now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,year old woukd just be disaappinted in me that i have never slept in a bed with another person
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so the uncle was ten when the kid was born thats some grandparents on a slow schedule and some parents who really cant wait to pop one out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,syphilis and fighting crime is this a reference to something seems like an interesting combination
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah man theyve got everything sorted out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,getting me degree had to go back and read the whole thing in a pirates voice thanks for that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rofl that was my first thought too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,am also lets cut our losses before we become decrepit skeletons at the ripe old age of lets do this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,real talk tho im turning in a week and ive never been on a date feeling a bit behind the curve year old op is already on tinder shes doing fine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hell of a pickup line wanna file jointly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tax break you mean marriage penalty the tax breaks come with kids
SubredditDrama,not_removed,childhood me thought old men age had prostrate issues that caused them to rub their crotches a lot it explained somehow the concept of older guys walking like they were wearing diapers or gangsta guys walking like they had stuck a wood beam up their asses thats also why they needed more space on buses you would too if you had prostrate issues childhood me wasnt very smart
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a guy and i have cats is that bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt that all the reasons
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good to know i have more years until dying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,were all gonna die alone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks ill be crying into my birthday hamburger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,high five stranger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks dude 🤘
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i napped all day so it was pretty good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont know why youre being downvoted tinder used to be awesome because everyone was on the same page and everyone knew what it wasa casual hookup app for fun then all these basics get on there with inflated egos saying i am not here just to hookup then why are you here on a hookup app go to pof or matchcom now every app is basically the same and no one really knows what anyones expectations aresex dating a marriage friends friends i have encountered so many girls who are just trying to make friends great i support youbut dont do it on bumble or tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unfortunately that was me felt pretty dumb when i realized most guys i talked to on there were primarily interested in hooking up but this is really what ive always encountered on dating sites anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people treating it like a dating service is why theres so much confusion and disappointment on it people coming in with completely different expectations meh it becomes what you make of it ive had a bunch of good dates through tinder after reading peoples carefully crafted and semi truthful ten page life stories on okc a few intriguing bullet points on tinder was kinda refreshing ive met some unexpectedly interesting people because of it it helps me look outside my type i guess ymmv also it seems to be dependent on geography in some cities it seems to be very hookupfocused in others less
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not at first but they actually made the conscious decision to make it a more serious dating app over a hookup app a while back thats why they took moments away and threw stuff like tinder social in its place imo it was a stupid decision they had the first and only place ive ever seen women were comfortable going to look for a hook up and they threw it in the fucking garbage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it depends where really i feel like here in the netherlands its used for both lots of people i know are in serious ltrs with people they met on tinder lots are also just using it to hook up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it could happen would rather be dating at than stuck in a miserable marriage with a dead bedroom or something divorce and death of loved ones will technically always be pulling older folks back into the dating pool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you at least divorced
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dating at get over it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just out of curiosity not criticising or anything how old are you and why do you hope to get married before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbyageatfirstmarriageeurope closer to for men and for women its lower in the us than europe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in the us its
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when my aunt got married at everyone kept moaning about how it was about time she finally found a husband cant even tell you the shitstorm my mothers marriage at caused
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for real my girlfriend recently got divorced as in legally weve been dating for over a year and she split with her exhusband half a year before we met and shes im feeling the opposite push at age assuming we stay together well get married within years and while i feel perfectly comfortable with that prospect i get weirdly self conscious that other people in their midtwenties might think im crazy happily all but friend of mine is over anyway they all freak out when i remind them i will turn in though so thats fun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the women in the link doesnt specify that she has never been married for the purposes of the linked post i think including divorces and widows isnt best that brings it down to married
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in the us you mean figures vary a lot around the world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did that ever work out for you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stick to the nursing homes grandpa
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah ma had me at
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep the math checks out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,me irl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or who are about to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i live in this weird dichotomy where i feel like im old but my parents arent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see year olds call themselves old all the time honestly its pretty annoying dont act old and you wont be called old there was a year old in my class who wasnt even the oldest by a standard deviation yet acted like she was sooooo old to be in the class she didnt even look old in fact she was hot i would have never thought she was older than if she hadnt constantly brought it up for no reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im lots of attractive women who are get so many messages on regular dating sites no matter what they write in their profiles that many dont bother anymore so for them tinder is exactly the same thing but they can control who messages them and control how far away the people are most just say not here for hookups
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only time i think its weird is when you see a year old with an age range set to like thats a little creepy what if she hot tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only time i think its weird is when you see a year old with an age range set to like thats a little creepy yes but the good thing about tinder is that those year olds have to swipe right on your year old ass as well the few who do obviously go for older people you might want to use your non arthritic finger for swiping though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whaaat do straight people think if tinder as a hookup app me and all the other gay guys i know think of it as the classier dating version of grindr
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only time i think its weird is when you see a year old with an age range set to like thats a little creepy id imagine they get next to no legitimate matches unless theyre smoking hot and even then probably a bunch of weirdos who are and legitimately looking for
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you know that going to the movies isnt about watching the movie right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol right i love going out to eat with my so we end up having the best conversations a good play can also be really fun i havent gone to one in a long time though c any youd recommend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,get a job hippy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,go away mom im in my room
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i meant the age range not just the people currently in that range and who doesnt have more money now than when they were in college i was poor as shit back then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the bussy flows quite freely especially in certain secret discord channels ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sjw did something change i thought the triple parentheses meant someone was jewish
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre gonna go far kid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oldirl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hell when i was in my early to mid seemed old now im and im old
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so do i and so will these kids who think is old
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just the once
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it usually doesnt make for a cool story later
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you forgot that the story is for your kids
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont ruin the bar dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for real marriage isnt about feeling tied down man if youre lucky enough to find a life partner in your twenties more power to you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shhh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you read hes so years left
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean a life of eternal singledom is probably one if the easiest things in the world to achieve if you desire it dont let your dreams be dreams
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well said beep boop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a kid kept trying to hit on me because i put a tiara on my car in rocket league it got bad enough that i finally had to dig out my headphones and tell him im a year old man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was in voice chat with some other players in a game i play often one time although i almost never use voice chat one of the kids was doing to whole how old do you think i am thing and was shocked when i nailed that he was a year old kid im a teacher and have been for a while it was blaringly obvious he was shocked haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know people in their that game my neighbor only stopped playing quake live when people stopped doing everything but duels
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all they know is their parents and their parents arent even close to the norm most kids that age dont even play games like overwatch and stick to whatever runs on a tablet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think people like that forget how recent in history video games came about as a widespread hobby you dont just lose hobbies because you age think of it like the music your grandparents listen to for example it likely isnt katy perry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a year old girl in overwatch so need pocket heals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,was playing csgo and i was got matched with a bunch of teens i wanna say and they asked how old i was i said i was they said wow thats creepy and gross that you still play video games at which is hilarious because half of csgos population is in their mid to late
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i get people trying to friend me all the time just because im a woman playing overwatch i just friend other women though almost have a full stack if you wanna join an all girl team
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i had the same thing happen the other day some kid maybe years old grouped with us so we invited him to our party chat not knowing he was and annoying the first thing he says is omg how old are you people a couple of us answered that were in our and he just couldnt believe it he kept saying how we were too old for video games and shit i was like so youre telling me that when you turn youll throw out all your games and consoles and stop playing video games forever and he says yeah because when im ill have a job and a house and i wont have time for video games because ill be a grownup i was going to make fun of him until i remembered being in middle school and telling my teacher that i was going to be married with children and a house by because that age just seemed so old to me kids amirite
SubredditDrama,not_removed,year old me would just be impressed that i can still get it up at the grand old age of i wasnt a smart teenager
SubredditDrama,not_removed,year old me would be amazed that year old me is still playing wow for the most part with breaks in between big updates
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im exhausted just thinking about that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i made teenage me proudsorta im in my and i did it with the same gender so i did well enough even if not to plan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as the oft resident sex educator in my social circle this is one of many things i have had to explain many many times sometimes if i really want to shock someone i explain that not all men want three ways or have any interest in having them o
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my oldest nephew is years younger than me my youngest is years younger than me same halfsister she doesnt make good decisions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nope but it explains moon knight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and once theyre grown theyre gonna do something with their lives theyre gonna take the world back from all the old people who have wrecked it and make it what its supposed to be theyre not gonna grow old in some ninetofive bullshit its gonna be different for them better you dont know its not a phase mom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did it add to me tale
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its yorkshire not pirate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hah i was a decrepit skeleton at the age of already also i was married at that age there might have been a connection
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all that matters is that you are happy where you are nothing wrong with being single but if you want something new there are ways to get out there just gotta find a place you are comfortable with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im and in the same situation youre fine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just wait another years and youll be where i am thats something to look forward to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a long life too aside from the other good advice here might seem old to you right now but once you get there it really doesnt seem like it and me would be shocked at how much better rightnow me is with women
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sending good vibes your way when i met my so he was and had never been in a date im also years younger than him so we couldnt have been together any earlier without being weird lol happily together years now and have an awesome life so i guess this to say no fear you never know where that other half may be my real talkjust become the best version of yourself so that when you do meet you will be ready for it good luck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey bb u wanna go halfsies on the cpa this yeaaaar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is so hot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,want to qualify for my survivor benefits for social security
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the real success comes with being unmarried with kids but living with the motherfather of your mutual children example in the state of michigan my best friend was paying child support to his girlfriend for their son because she was legally a single mother they were poor as shit to begin with so they also got healthcare for him but not so poor that they got food stamps for free state medicaid but come tax time he got to claim him as a dependent and got to claim the money spent on child support so he was essentially paying himself child support and getting a tax break for it why they decided to finally get married i dont know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well my father will marry me to the person who provides the fattest cow so how much does your priced prized milk cow weigh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,prostrate sic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mightve been reading the wrong manual ill do the car thing to balance the universe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a woman and i have cats lets get married so that we have of the cute little bastards
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i say the emotional support and having a best friend always by your side is a pretty big plus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is the darkest timeline
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh you had a birthday food item
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is great i am glad for you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can see how it happened two peeps meet up on tinder for a hookup the sex is good so it turns into fwb they find out theyre actually decently compatible because that happens sometimes and they turn it into something serious their friends ask where they met and they say tinder isnt that wild but all their friends hear is i met my so on tinder which means anyone can meet their match on tinder and boom hookup purpose of the app is undermined
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive always assumed that anyone who says theyre looking for friends on a dating site is just looking to add a bit of plausible deniability
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where does it say on tinder that its just a hookup app i dont see that stated anywhere my understanding is that its an app to meet people physically near you which i dont get any other way i have great experiences making friends on tinder just dont match people who say theyre looking for friends if thats not what you want
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean bumble has a whole section devoted to finding new friends so thats not really that crazy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but unlike okc or match or even pof theres no match algorithms or even really profile prominence on tinder youre just swiping left or right based on looks like not hating but why was that your expectation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i was in the dating pool i joined tinder for dating and i did meet my fair share of people wanting to hook up and couples wanting a third shudder but i did make like two friends on there so shrug ive always encounted hook up only people on all dating platforms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess in that persons eyes i used tinder wrong i ended up marrying one of my matches
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean to be fair a ton of different things could happen i dont think you should strive to stay single because you are afraid of marriage difficulties
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and basically two reasons one is that i legitimately feel like married life is more suitable for my personality just in the sense of having that teamwork in place for handling life i dont have any huge aspirations that require me to be single two is that i definitely want to be a father and im already in a place in life where i can handle it at least financially and stuff parenting obviously comes with its own challenges besides that and id like to be younger so i can spend more life time with a family but im not pinning my self worth on it or anything ill either marry my current girlfriend in the next two years or so she actually is or if we dont work out i could potentially meet someone when im and do it ill reevaluate if need be along the way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbyageatfirstmarriageeurope closer to for men and for women ah i may have seen swedens stats at one point and in my mind they became all of wes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yesss finally above average
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hate that so much ill be next month and am nowhere near close to getting married i dont know if people really want me to get married because they wont be in my marriage anyway as much as they want me to have a wedding that they can come to even if i got married tomorrow id elope im too broke for a wedding
SubredditDrama,not_removed,almost her mom lived too far away though she had been talking to me earlier though so not sure if that counts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats the family dynamic like with such a short age gap
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not surprising she isnt happily settled down then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pretty close actually
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and this is why you dont use any part of your birth year in a public username
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah hot older ladies of reddit dont be afraid to set that age range as low as you feel comfortable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was literally made to be straight grindr
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably a bunch of weirdos who are and legitimately looking for hey now lets not shame people for what theyre attracted to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cant forget there are tonne of of girls and boys in their late teensearly twenties that are lowkey open to a sugar daddy situation with an older guy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what for making out maybe youre thinking about first dates with people you already know fairly well going for intimate physical contact with someone you hardly know is weird unless thats the mutuallyestablished context of the date in the first place which to be fair i guess it easily could be in the case of tinder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,countless jobless millennials with tens of thousands in student loans they would have less money now than when they were in college of accounts in the department of educations federal student loan portfolio trillion are either delinquent or behind on payments because the recent graduates are severely underemployed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ok bussy flows sounds like something you get after a night of hard whiskey drinking
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nothing changed but the idiots using those terms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was parodying the fact that theres a lot of people in the intersection of people who rant about sjws and antisemitic nutbars cultural marxism is the dog whistle here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,social jewstice warrior
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i own canes how did this happen

SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh my heavens its worse than i thought get him married stat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rtotallynotrobots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maaan i cant wait for all these kids to go back to school in a week i had this one guy freaking out that i was a solo queued girl in competitive overwatch plat almost diamond now all i said was can we get a solider instead of a junkrat in case of a pharah he immediately types girl you sound dick thirsty for asking for a character swap k he then spent the rest of the minute game trying to hit on me and ask me to send him nudes or to give him my email so i could get a dick pic i had enough and told him to take the dick out of his mouth the next time he tried to hit on a girl he then rage quit i hate the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my game picture is a chick so when people get mad that i wreck them in siege i get a lot of hate messages with words like bitch and cunt it feels good getting that message from xbox telling me they followed up on the comments i reported and took action 😊
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just record yourself saying in a deep basso profundo im a man and sell the sound clips to women trying to avoid getting hit on in online videogames
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a male friend of mine has the nickname jenny which he uses for his online handle in a few games it amazed me when we first gamed together how often he got dudes trying to chat him up ingame because he had a girls name its fucking crazy and gives a bit of insight into the kind of shit women have to put up with online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sometimes i like to feel pretty damn it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have a pink kirby as my avatar and my name is the same i was invited to play some away from the randoms because i can at least hit the ball and finally into discord after a couple days of i start talking and then he says wait umm i thought you were a girl mfw

SubredditDrama,not_removed,sometimes you dont almond joy has nuts mounds dont
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sometimes you just want a nut
SubredditDrama,not_removed,preachin to the choir buddy askmens been giving me headaches lately so i dont go as often but when those threads pop up i really wish i were there in time to get in a flat sensible answer before it gets buried
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont diss khonsu
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aye matey
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as long as theres an even number of people in this comment thread we should be fine i hope im not an odd straggler because i want on the train too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unfortunately you are now divorced
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes not well at least im not and im kinda in the same situation as him or her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fixed interest cds or gtfo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no cows will he take an old lawn mower and a half sheet of plywood instead
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my neighbour has some good cows ill nick one whens the date
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i want to know what my dowry will be before i prove anything to you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what if i can only procure cattle and not cows
SubredditDrama,not_removed,alright i guess we can take turns hitting on college chicks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like this plan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ew gross
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but you can have that without marriage i liveed with my husband because i love him got married cuz i love the tax benifits power of attorney and mainly because i joined the navy and wanted to make more money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you say hes just a friend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i always say it because i could use more friends like if we wouldnt work as a couple and dont wanna hook up but shes still cool im open to even just friendly conversations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive never become friends with a person who said they were just looking for friends but i have become friends with people looking for relationships who it didnt work out with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think people are saying that because it makes for a piss poor dating app sure its your right to try and use it as a dating app but like literally every other dating websiteapp is better meeting people you might potentially have a longterm thing with because you can actually match people based on at least some amount of compatibility tinder you match people based on how hot you look on your first pic maybe your first few pics everything about it makes connecting with someone on a real level impossible the only way it works out as a dating app is if two people magically make it through the swiping matching awkwardcreepy tinder flirting phases and meet up in person and then find out that they are compatible against all odds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im with ya i dont see why tinder is exclusively a hookup app if people want to use it to hookup great if people want to use it to find something serious great as well just do the adult thing which i know a lot of people struggle with and make expectations clear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah you match based on pictures and a little bio so superficial but doesnt matter had sex
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just because you meet your future spouse at a club doesnt mean a club is a place people go to meet their future spouse youre not using the club wrong but when you go to the club looking for a lifetime partner youre going to be pretty damn disappointed most of the time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh im not really saying strive to stay single just strive to be happy you can be happy as a single person or happy as a partnered person
SubredditDrama,not_removed,makes sense thanks for your answer my curiosity has been satisfied
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so what youre really saying is the you should find someone thing from family never ends i got looked at like i was crazy when this was brought up at thanksgiving and i said i was actively avoiding it since i plan on moving back across the country when im done with school in years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean i dont really got anything to compare it too i tried living with my dad n his family for a bit in grade and i realized im use to a lot more independence then they wanted not like going out or anything but i was always expected to be more sulf sufficient around the house was there something specific you wanted to know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean his mother is on tinder so obviously there was some issues at some point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant use my birth year in mine or else i look like a neonazi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know quite a few people that found a gf on tinder a few of which went on there with the exact intention of finding that others that like you said were just getting it in and decided to stick around
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it depends on where you are i live in st louis and have had a decent experience with tinder but ive found it most certainly does have a much higher focus on dating once you move towards the mid to late twenties or older it seems the hookup aspect is more common among those and under at least in my town though if you look like a greek god then i suspect those rules dont apply no matter where you go or how old you are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all these people thinking tindr is for dating lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im and ive never actually made out at the movies ever if you just want to make out stay at home its cheaper
SubredditDrama,not_removed,countless jobless millennials fortunately we have the technology to count these jobs on unemployment rates what part of this data from the bureau of labor and statistics supports the idea that those in their mid and early are significantly worse off in employment than people older than them this data is showing a difference in unemployment from those age to years a difference certainly but not the doom and gloom youre saying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,less net worth not the same thing as less money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess it depends on where you live in portland it seems like its populated with either mostly welloff hipsters or homeless junkies and i usually dont hang out with the junkies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,income based repayment if youre unemployed your monthly payments should be zero
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shouldve done a trade
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe for you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay i got it now thank you for your clarification
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how many are also a sword if the answer is none you have explaining to do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its for all the caning of young whippersnappers you do right you know for being knowitalls disrespectful to their elders walking on your god damn lawn and too much virtualizing on the cyber to meme the augmented cartoon pornography
SubredditDrama,not_removed,build some furniture out of them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hear you with these christmas kids ive been playing for a few months now and after christmas the game turned into complete garbage im no super gamer or anything but i barely want to even play it right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not assuming that you dont know but i really did not for an embarrassingly long time so this is for anybody on pc overwatch who might not know hit p and from there you can right click on anybody and report user ive had to report a few dudes now i dont know if it really does anything but its satisfying the best is when you say reported and they quip back about how you cant do that in this game or i was just joking grow a spine blah blah like yeah keep crying it doesnt change anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hah it wont change at all when kids go back to school
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow calls you thirsty then asks for nudes and wants to show you his dick holy lack of selfawareness batman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh gosh tell me about it overwatch competitive has been hell the last week with all these kids im down like rating this week and nearly every loss is children fighting with each other about who should switch hanzo or widow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah my go to pick up line eyy girl imma swap out my junkrat so da teams balanced
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fucking same year old girl occasionally mistaken for a younger boy he other night i did competitive and wasnt getting any shit for my heals or playstyle for the first of the game until i say soldier flanking then i hear oh youre a girl no wonder were losing i responded with a trite i sure am glad skill and gender are correlated he stopped talking to me after that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this kind of shit is why i just cant play online games anymore except with people i know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the saddest part of that story is that shitheels still play junkrar at plat and diamond im in silver and i feel like i have to fucking juggle every role cause no one will play the right comp for the match
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is why i dont use a mic unless its with a preestablished group of friends and i have a deep voice i cant imagine how bad it is for people who sound more feminine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont really know what people like him are thinking do they really think theyll get anything other than an annoyed person on the other end if they behave like this i wonder who raised them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it sucks that happened to you honestly im glad i have a solid group to play with in comp as i usually avoid these types when you get up to triple queue or more i actually enjoy the game a lot more now though quickplay has become more of a shit show if you can find a nice chill group to play with regularly found mine on reddit actually do it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whoa overwatch has the whole riot ranking system too man i really do have no idea what im doing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and this is why i dont play moms anymore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,run voice software to change voice to be lower on mic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i kind of hate playing siege with women just because the entire chat is filled with guys hitting on her endlessly i could care less what gender or age you are if you work with the team but it sucks when a woman joins and everything becomes some sort of sexual innuendo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,add who lives with his mom and id buy that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i played wow for a few months as a female high elf in that time i learned what erp stood for and that unless i played a male character the daily requests for it would never stop speaking as a man men seriously suck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is just plain ignorance of major nintendo characters its disgusting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,year olds apparently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i definitely remember pretending to be when i was year olds just seemed so much older at the time p
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah there are a lot of ex or current military that play fpss im a colead of a planetside outfit the main leader is an exmarine and a bunch of his buddies who in the marines with him play various games with us its amazing just how diverse the backgrounds of gamers can be excluding the fact that were generally all male and rarely black
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,almond joy mounds tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ahh you two are so cute sadly cute but cute nonetheless go you two not necessarily together
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sorry to hear that have you tried getting yourself out there i dont know your situatuon and i cannot imagine how difficult it can seem but if you arent happy you owe it to yourself to try this world is awful we owe it to ourselves to try
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just cant see this working out you better hop on tinder right away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a bucket of milk from our new cow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait did they pay you more once you got married or you essentially made more because of the tax benefits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yo baby you you got what i need but you say hes just a friend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tinder you match people based on how hot you look on your first pic maybe your first few pics the only way it works out as a dating app is if two people magically make it through the swiping matching awkwardcreepy tinder flirting phases and meet up in person and then find out that they are compatible against all odds which is exactly the same way to match in real life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah relatives treat you like your worth as a human being is based solely on whether or not you find someone to marry and reproduce with this is especially true for women i am not where i want to be in my life in many ways but i am not about to find a partner just to appease my family not to mention what if i dont want kids what if i cant have kids the answers to both of those questions are none of my familys business you are smart for putting a relationship on the back burner knowing your future involves your relocation anyone who doesnt respect that maturity and insight can fuck right off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at least with my family theres a distinct generational divide between my sister and i to our parents do you notice that with yours
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats definitely a problem for people born in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that was my thought too if youre a teenager desperate for a place that gives you a dark room away from your parents and another pretense for being there fine but if you have your own living space and arent accountable to anyone else for who you make out with or when whats the point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most of the new jobs arent anywhere near as stable or well paying student loan debt and out of control rent siphons up an excessive portion of the money earned its not unemployment as much as underemployment that is the issue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,go away u filthy datasjw
SubredditDrama,not_removed,imo when people talk about jobless millennials theyre talking about something closer to underemployment than unemployment note that nthcxd even said underemployment in the next paragraph unfortunately i cant find broken down by age that would likely be a better proxy for what people mean might be even better though im not sure its quite kosher to add percentages with such different denominators
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you know if this is total or if it leaves out people who have dropped out of the labor force cant find anything on it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from the link to to to to and up difference i find this misleading to say the least to age group has assuming similar population count compared to of the older generation almost double for younger millennials its even worse vs and that precisely is the recent college grad demographic if you dont believe me about the federal loan delinquencies look it up so yeah fortunately we have the technology but often times that doesnt make the user smarter automatically
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think it matters where you live wherever you go if you only hang out with well off people you will eventually believe everyone has money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not at liberty to answer that question
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what im not i get a new cane everytime i lose a leg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my little brother got for christmas and i apologize on his behalf
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same with rocket league
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn i hadnt thought of this might explain why ive run into toxic people lately in overwatch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my buddy got me stardew valley for christmas im so happy in my little farm world growing my little parsnips all alone i may never go online again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i got it for christmas not my first battlefield though and im still kind of shocked how terrible everyone is at playing the actual game ill be like highest score on my team with kills and deaths loleveryone is trying to play calladoody id probably have an awesome kdr if i just sniped from the middle of nowhere the whole game like of everyone playing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a bit of a more involved process but in rocket league has some similar problems theres a report feature as well explicitly says its for when people are acting like that used it a few times
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im so lucky my six stack group are some chill dudes from the west coast they help mellow me out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the summer that never ended
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is why i quit rocket league the community is too toxic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i dropped from to kill me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i only play with my planetside outfit for comp if im solo queueing its always quick play solo queue is a great way to kill your rating
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so weird its been the opposite for me i went up sr in one day yesterday only had one game with noticeable kids and they were super cool
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i used to play enemy territory competitively with a old male politicians name so everyone would not know i was female and i would never hop on tsvent to play on any any any public servers only my clanmates knew i was female boy was everyone shocked when i went to qc but it was because i hate being hit on all the time in a video game and people being friends with me for ulterior motives which happened way more than it should
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but they are thats why there are womens leagues for gaming otherwise they never make it into tournaments its a strange thing nobody really knows why but its the way it always is im amazed were still finding things that show gender dimorphism but technology somehow finds a way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when came out my friends and i got real good at muting everyone in a lobby people are insufferable online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kids have been doing this to girls in online video games for years who are you kidding
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the saddest part of that story is that shitheels still play junkrar at plat and diamond i mean if they can play junkrat at the diamond or plat level then why not i mean dont get me wrong meta play and working with your team is super important but it goes both ways sometimes you can play by having everyone copying the currently popular pro meta sometimes you need to let your teammates play the characters that they can and play around their strengths
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait i hate playing w women cuz men act like trash how does that fuckin work
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i fuk yo mom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what does erp stand for 🤔 oh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn ive played female toons regularly on wow and i never had much trouble with it if anyone got flirty id just tell them im a guy and if they did anything other than stop rightclick and ignore solved the problem i think one time someone switched accounts and tried talking to me again but reporting them for violating the ignore rules took care of that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt perfect but im happy to say ive never been hit on as my mushroom lady though i suppose the big silly mushroom head puts people off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if they made a dark chocolate almond joy that would be the best
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no need to be sad im just making jokes to pass the time almost weekend time yay if i wasnt happy with my situation i would be out trying to change it rather than making jokes on reddit 😄 making joke on reddit is fun even if most of mine are bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id like to second this especially the try this seems like one of those situations where the line between i want to do this and im supposed to do this to be happy gets more blurred if it helps ive found people are commonly pretty into folks who arent experienced hell ive been on both sides of that you dont have to worry about pushing yourself past what makes you happy there wont be a too late
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but im too old
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah if you are married you are automatically given a housing allowance so you essentially double your pay for putting a ring on it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in real life you get to know them by actually interacting with them on a regular basis most people meet their significant others at work or school or through a mutually shared hobby the real life equivalent of tinder is a club a place known for casual hook ups
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not to mention what if i dont want kids what if i cant have kids the answers to both of those questions are none of my familys business oh i expect theyll lose their shit when they find out i have zero intention of having kids
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not that i know of or not that id recognize can you give an example because all i can really think of is like tv parents being hopelessly confused by social media and thats definitely not a problem here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,was also a bad year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so what youre saying is that theyre not jobless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unemployment and underemployment after college has been an issue for decades its gotten worse but its not a new problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,out of control rent is only hapoening in a couple west coast cities my rent is month for square feet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thinking about it i remembered unemployment rates do not count people who have dropped out of the workforce nonetheless a year old looking for a job has a higher chance of getting one than a year old which is part of the argument here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,persons are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job have actively looked for work in the prior weeks and are currently available for work persons who were not working and were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been temporarily laid off are also included as unemployed receiving benefits from the unemployment insurance ui program has no bearing on whether a person is classified as unemployed httpswwwblsgovcpslfcharacteristicshtmunemp httpswwwblsgovcpslfcharacteristicshtmnlf httpswwwblsgovcpstableshtm there are all sorts of charts in those links
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for younger millennials its even worse right people in college if you go to college for a year degree at you graduate at maybe or that is solidly within the range all things being equal is it totally inconceivable that of college students are supported completely by their parents and dont need jobs or that recent college grads have a slightly harder time finding new jobs compared to someone with years experience you said that there were countless jobless millennials and the data just doesnt support that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a pretty general rule that youre going to have more money when youre older and have been in the job market for some time from what youve been saying it implies that droves of college students arent able to find any job after graduating and are unable to pay their debts which is just not true
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its cool just tell him to ptfo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rocket league at least has solid matchmaking chances are you wont see any new players you will however get a ton of asshole kids on winter break playing a lot more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it wasnt that way before christmas the game was fun as hell before challenging good battles even losing was alright because it was a brutal fight for objectives you had to hand it to them now its terrible just have to wait for them to get better or go back to school i guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its why i quit multiplayer games as a whole unless theyre with friends the internet is too toxic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was huge into a couple years back how is it now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thankfully ive not been harassed too much i usually play with a group consisting of friends and family but my cousin and i are the only ones that play comp and he ranked way higher than i did so we cant play together mostly ill get the random omg its a grill kappa and then i just dont talk unless i absolutely have to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lack of female competitive players does not indicate any sort of skill discrepancy there are any number of social factors that could lead to esports being a male dominated crowd and it really doesnt take much to imagine why
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a strange thing nobody really knows why its because theres less of them and thats it really video games dont require physical strength
SubredditDrama,not_removed,social factors play a major key role in this in the past maybe years ago there was a lot more show us your tits going on its really frowned upon now if the pro players do that and if the audience does that to a pro player theres still things like social media events marketing and stuff to navigate plus finding a team meshing well with them and getting them to listen to you i dont think womens teams are an answer because of some of the past projects that turned out to be like a joke people just want to see women on a mixed gender team kicking ass that being said i know of some people making their way up in the overwatch scene who are women im kind of expecting to see more women in blizzard esports over the next few years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,amazing how fast you could mute every person in the lobby that you didnt know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think they meant they got sick of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,allofwarezru
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same way you can say i dislike this band because their fans are rabid and annoying i dislike the atmosphere a woman brings to a gaming lobby its not her fault and i never said it was just that i find it distracting and annoying the way people react lol the downvotes are hilarious sorry i dont like listening to guys trip over themselves to impress a girl they just met online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im assuming erotic role play since you didnt answer and that was the first definition on urban dictionary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my reaction too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this was back when burning crusade had just come out so a bit ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,early on the gms were incredibly inactive or at least busy helping people with bugs i remember for months there was an erp for pay service run out of a farmhouse in goldshire so a brothel you think theyd break that shit up quick but no it was common all around
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this was back during the release of burning crusade so a whole ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that sounds amazing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wasnt really sad is probably the wrong word im struggling to find the right word pathos perhaps but as i read through the comments i thought aww bless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so thats how sauron raised the money for his massive orc armies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lots of americans hit on random hot girls at bars or on streets and then exchange awkwardcreepy flirting phrases and met up in person and then find out theyre compatible or not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gilmore girls relationship is what they are referring to is think
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but their jobs net worth and quality of life have steadily gotten worse you cant just pretend like there isnt a problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they have advanced degrees and work in jobs that require no advanced qualifications while they use their skills and education to participate and run subreddits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,west coast cities are also where the vast majority of the good jobs are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah the usually quoted unemployment number is on that page you can see a couple alternate versions they keep track of often one of those is a better measure for what people think of as unemployment or even just civilian labor force participation rate unfortunately here they dont seem to break any others down by demographics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ppreciate it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if higher unemployment numbers dont support my claim that there are more unemployed people among millennials than baby boomers i really dont know what else i can do to show how about this as a proxy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well the of student loans being delinquent stat is true so obviously theres at least some truth to that i tend to think that while millennials have faced a particularly difficult job market and financial situation it isnt all that much worse than what some previous generations have faced what is very different is that this generation is saddled with more debt right out of the gate than any generation in recent memory factor in a lot of other issues like cost of living increase vs wage stagnation which affects everyone but far more acutely a year old just starting out and you can see that millennials have some very valid complaints while every generation thinks they have it tough it isnt always just baseless whining
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is just not true it is average debt a college student has at graduation tripled from in to in thats at federal stafford loan apr of as a member of this generation i can tell you this is very real what is also very real as i perceive from the general election and this exchange is that older generation really are clueless and could not be bothered i just hear you get a job and work it for a while and youll be able to afford things and comfortably grow old thats how it was for me and thats how its supposed to be heres food for thought remember social securitywho do you think you are going to tax to continue to fund it once baby boome retire the unemployed college grads already defaulting on their student loans before even starting their career what is your retirement plan in case that falls through
SubredditDrama,not_removed,git gud scrub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pretty dead almost all the good players are gone most of us are pretty burned out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep actually was one of many reasons we switched to pc stuff over time i should be able to talk to who i want online
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly i got less and less patient with the immature douchebags out there and eventually left entirely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hear you but the way you said it is victim blaming instead turn it around and put the blame on the guys i hate playing with guys who get distracted whenever a girl is playing and just hit on her relentlessly see the difference
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hah well rest assured its all in good fun i hope your weekend is great
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i never seen gilmore girls i wouldnt know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,were not talking about millennials net worth relative to people their age x amount of years ago were talking about whether or not countless millennials are jobless were talking about whether or not someone age has more income than someone younger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if theyre that good then that rent and debt should be no problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just posted some links that might be relevant to this conversation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of course my point originally was that its silly to assume you wont have more money while youre working than when youre a student
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bruh this is the reason people dont invite you to parties i know you want to feel victimized right now but its not that hard out there yeah it sucks more than previous generations but if you live below your means make reasonable payments on your student debt and just be generally reasonable youll be fine this is coming from someone who went to school for english and worked odd jobs through the years because i never expected to get a career using my degree
SubredditDrama,not_removed,victim blaming would be me saying women gamers only do it for attention and are a distraction to gaming i hate them and wont play with them im attacking the female gamers and so im blaming them for the atmosphere they create because its their own doing if thats what i said that would be a cause for downvotes or disagreement what i actually said was i dislike playing with them because of the guys in chat same exact thing you just suggested i say edit rambled to much so made it more concise
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and i yours cheer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh no he used hyperbole better get the rope
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it would be at the beginning
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have degrees and have means to pay off my loans which i am doing so diligently i am speaking on behalf of my generation yeah and just so you know you arent the only one telling us to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps see you never after you retire
SubredditDrama,not_removed,armchair experts are what make reddit so terrible but the drama so great
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i work in aviation and this drama is soooooo goooooooood all the op has is a private pilot license and hes arguing with an airline transport pilot who flies the plane in question this is glorious all praise to you bringer of airplane popcorn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i will go down with this ship
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people make mistakes i bet you do too so close to self awareness yet so far
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is really the hill he wants to die on hes weighed his options and hes made his decision
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow that guy is insufferable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i spent way too much time looking for
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think reddit guy needs to step up his game and accuse the pilot of being incompetent at his job if some guy watches videos knows more about the subject than he does gotta maximize that drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as an inactive private pilot i can tell you that an unusually large percentage of the general aviation community is comprised of douchebags like this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and strangely enough hes also a frequent poster to thedonald
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is it grandstanding to say im not surprised the guys a trump supporter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but he did stay at a holiday inn last night
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rflying is actually quite the goldmine for conversations like these
SubredditDrama,not_removed,looks like youve got some nakiri knife action going there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how embarrassing to actually double down once called out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude got shrekt nearly instantaneously with words
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is fantastic drama so sick of politics and all the comments here being political discussion instead of talking about the drama itself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i work in mining and we use helicopters for support on a daily basis had this one guy start with us and within the week he was trying to give the pilots tricks on how to lift the collective correctly and how to move the chopper in certain situations it still blows my mind how people who know absolutely nothing about something will teach experts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive had sex with a pilot in a public restroom and i say both of these guys are wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dammit another high quality sub that got too big i loved lurking there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like ken m for real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,edit fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what ive noticed when seeing people post about shit that i actually know about is that most of these walloftext posting reddit experts are full of shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive researched a bunch of different threads and ive determined that armchair experts are not what make reddit so terrible instead its actually the circlejerking
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this reminds me of the other day when someone on td unsarcastically told me they know all about the situation in europe because theyve been following these countries for years bitch i live there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup i call it university of reddit students i work in industrial maintence basically fixing huge machines but most redditors will tell me my job will be obsolete because automation have had a few arguments about this the people that sat in front of a screen for school and work think robots will do every job but theirs theyll look up very specialized robot or machine and say look this robot can do that but they arent seeing the whole picture its like they are arguing that your washing machine alone can clean your whole house dust the ceiling fans make your bed change your toilet paper when its empty and do your errands for you that one machine doesnt do all that and combining the of machines you use daily isnt possible plus they dont think of the price tag to do so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair this sub isnt immune either my first experience with this sub was an argument on rchemistry about some kid doing stupid dangerous shit in his basement and the top comment here was gee i wouldnt want to be a chemist if theyre all ass holes to this kid to which i can only reply fucking good i dont want to die in a lab accident cause some idiot thinks he can do whatever he wants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when youre actually a professional in x field and someone is arguing with you about something in your field theyre misinformed about obviously you dont whip out credentials because that makes you look like a dick like who the fuck uses a degree or job position to settle an online backandforth but even trying to show them some learning material can result in further ironic derision
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wholeheartedly agree i bloody love a good yeah this is my job and youre talking shite smackdown especially as you can envisage the roll of the eye that accompanies it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you might like rshittyaskflying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously most of the knowledge you get to receive a ppl is from a book thats maybe a third the size of the atp manual pair that with the hour minimum for an atp license and what you actually have to go through to get to an atp certification commercial ifr cfl and multi and turbine most likely its like a guy with an associates degree trying to argue with a doctor
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah hes really dedicated to not admitting his ignorance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and i wont put my hands up and surrender
SubredditDrama,not_removed,captains error or did the front fall off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,op crashed and burned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not really many other options when the ship is a bombardier dash turboprop airliner
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all those hours spent on youtube wont be in vain
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i think hes wrong about the flare i see it too but his point about whether thats a crash or not is valid imho the people arguing against him are making an argument about as useful as the gun thats not a clip its a magazine argument its a distraction more than anything for us lay people its a crash if youre an air accident investigator or an insurance adjuster then okay its not a crash but in this context its just a specious diversion that slows down the actual discussion of what happened
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i bet hes not a real pilot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,haha i was half expecting michael bay to have directed the video but no a flare in aeronautics is a clever little thing designed to aid the planes reception by the ground its a simple tag which goes beside the planes name carrying a pithy witticism or quote which allows the ground to best judge the character of the plane before it lands
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was looking for this kind of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its at seconds cant you see it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean pilot guy is obviously a shill hired by the plane manufacturer wake up sheeple
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its almost like people who ignore facts have something in common
SubredditDrama,not_removed,talks out of his ass gets called out on it doubles down i wouldve been surprised if he had been anything but a trump supporter its thedonald to a t
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gear failures are fake news
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and a patriots fan thats at least as likely based on the double down attitude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not if i upvote you for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh man and he just keeps going too despite all evidence in front of his face
SubredditDrama,not_removed,missed that one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,through hours and hours of research i have come to the conclusion that this post got nothing to do with this thread source reddit expert
SubredditDrama,not_removed,except for raskhistorians when you get a walloftext youre almost certain that itll be a good read
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a melt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah its funny almost like people who have time to write characterlimit length posts on reddit with bullet points bold text and finely crafted hyperbole are the sort of people who dont have much going on in their lives
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and ive looked at thousands of drama threads from the left front seat you can see the downvotes at about seconds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,agreed fuck circlejerking and everyone who participates in it upvote if you agree with me pls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this guy gets it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre too close to the situation to have a proper perspective on whats going on man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,christ trumps and his supporters ideas of europe is such a fucking embarrassment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyve seen plenty of swedish national security advisors speaking on fox news theyre the ones with the real story dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah the guys that claimed that im poor and that healthcare is actually more expensive in my country than in the us because the social security contributions that are automically deducted from my pay slip are so high their claim was something ridiculous like for healthcare alone while its actually about total for health accident pension and unemployment insurance with a fixed limit in either direction
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly i feel like maintenance is one of the safe jobs left im an it analyst that supports complex it software and hardware systems the help desk level can be automated and outsourced and practically is when you get into the upper tiers im working on problems with no real documented precedent which means i need to understand how these systems work together in order to solve problems no one has ever seen before you cant at least not today outside of extremely limited capacities program a computer to be smarter than its programmer you cant program a computer to solve a problem nobody thought to tell it exists i even work on our automation software i cant write it to do my job beyond basic tasks because more complex ones are so nuanced the minute variables are what determines the real source of the problem and the computer today cant do a good job of differentiating these details in many disparate systems anyway and once the machines take over somebodys still got to maintain them youll be at your job forever in some capacity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah couldnt agree more your job is going to change massively but itll be a long time until it goes away the main threat is of course the expected emergence of airless factories that is facilities designed to be entirely automated from construction right through their lifecycle its the perfect cleanroom not only are you free of human dust but also oxygen based corrosion etc nasa had a good paper on the theory they want them for space but obviously theyll be useful on or in the earth also the second threat is things being designed to facilitate automated repair and replacement sensor driven awareness to tell the mainframe which part of the factory needs replacing so things can be automatically unassembled replaced and reassembled this like the prior is likely to be first used in space and is as yet a fair distance away when it does come itll take a long time to be slowly phased in even if someone unveiled a perfect solution today itd still take twenty years for even the vanguard companies to plan facilitate implement and initialise the first full scale uses of it and even if it was a perfect success itll take more than a human lifetime for the majority of the other industries to fully adopt it people often look at technology and say wow computers just came out of nowhere technology moves so fast these days but they forget babbage had been dead fifty years before turings machine ever decoded anything so thinking computers started in and by the internet was already everywhere is foolish firstly the internet was and is still a baby and secondly the computer wasnt just mature it was a pensioner assuming you dont mind fixing machines that fix machines i think your job is fairly safe for fair while yet a lot safer than most jobs that involve being part of a computer program that isnt yet written eg accounting programming journalism etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the argument is that machines cant do those jobs now but they will in a few decades when theyre as smart as humans or a little sooner than that depending on the tasks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while generally true i dont think that applies to all situations the op is a good example theres not enough evidence to make a definite conclusion so someone with experience is more likely to know whats more likely that said theres often no way to tell if the person claiming they have credentialsexperience really do have them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its really bad when it comes to mental health topics or about the field of psychology in general people have some wacky misconceptions and then cling to them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yep argued with people on legaladvice about whether something was a hipaa violation which is something ive been trained indeal with every day and people kept arguing saying well in my opinion it can be assumped no this is not about your opinion reading the faq on the hipaa site does not mean that you know everything about it and then still arguing even when sources clearly disagree
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i fucking love niche niche niche subreddits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsgfycatcompoiseddecentheron hahahahaha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dash hate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there will be no white flag above my door
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i put my hands up when theyre playing my song
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i was little i thought the line was and i wont poke my eyes out and surrender
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jeesh its been forever since i heard this song
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hours minutes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look man hes watched hours of microsoft flight simulator he knows his shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no thats a flair a flare is a dd monster that eats brains
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then they complain about multiculturalism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gear failure wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey hey hey hey not cool dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,goddamit i tried to reply to another guy who was talking about automation somewhere else in this thread this is my bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well a wall of text post with sources
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and rbadhistory too those walls of text are pretty good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey that was an important post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yet the fact remains they circlejerked didnt they pesky little details
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aaaaand flaired
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its always good to meet a fellow dramanaut
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was gonna downvote you for asking for upvotes but then i saw your high quality flair and changed my mind and downvoted you out of envy instead fuck it i dont even care anymore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,europe has been ruined by all these far left socialists like merkel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what i said i do a lot of mechanical and plc repair people dont understand that plcs and mechanical machines are one and they will never be able to fix themselves or have one robot be able to fix them all in one plant some has to fix the machines when mcdonalds becomes a giant vending machine i work with cnc plasma cutters messer machines basically the cut out parts out of feet of steel plates with multiple torch heads i can have the software brainfart on me or a prox switch go out or gas pressure drop and thousands of other problems some people think a robot can not only trouble shoot and repair theses problems but also replace a torch head or bearings with foot shafts in them find them in inventory and get them to the machine as well as wayne campbell would say uh yeah right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know a couple of trades rather well and im considering getting out of the office life to go back into them people will always need a new deck or a house painted or whatever the pay cut would be rough for a couple of years as i get on my feet but it might be worth it longterm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you cant at least not today outside of extremely limited capacities program a computer to be smarter than its programmer you cant program a computer to solve a problem nobody thought to tell it exists and yet people think that in a few years cars will all be driving themselves with no human input on a variety of roads in different weather and times of the day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot safer than most jobs that involve being part of a computer program that isnt yet written eg accounting programming journalism etc i think youre wildly overestimating the capabilities of automation while some of the rudimentary tasks in professions like those may be automated machines as we know them just arent capable of the types of novel and creative input that all generally all skilled labor requires a computer program will never know what questions to ask in the field while conducting an audit or cant cultivate a relationship with an inside source in a government bureaucracy while much low skill labor will continue to be decimated by automation and technological advances the long term demand for high skill labor has probably never been higher or more safe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,smart thats it what about agile enough to climb on other machines with out falling or light enough not to crush them also small enough to crawl under them when i see machine able to tear down an entire car interior suspension electrical break lines and engine break down and rebuild the car while being able to fit inside the car ill think differently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while generally true i dont think that applies to all situations the op is a good example oh i certainly agree i should have added the caveat that sometimes its not perceived as dickish i was speaking in general and stupidly ignored the exception in the linked discussion where dude i fly these things youre wrong is a sensible and measured response the linked discussion just got me thinking about how expertise is normally received on reddit and how people will argue to the death about anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats only because they want to sleep with their mom tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know youre an expert because you actually spell it right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my gift to you rvexillologycirclejerk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i laughed at what i thought was the funny part and then oh my god
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bitch i played pilotwings a few times i know what tf im talking about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought flare is a nonelemental high damage attack oftentimes unleashed by the king of dragons bahamut
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the problem is that i never see anything there anymore the mods just flatout remove most everything and the question never gets an answer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah and entirely necessary things were getting out of hand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre good melts brent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there you go again using hollywood terms like circlejerked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no they jerked and the circle collapsed wouldnt call that a circlejerk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,flared
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good stuff we do work with plcs occasionally as well but just simple stuff where it provides a software interface where someone can push a button on a computer which then activates something mostly idec microsmarts ive been impressed with them theyre probably one of the most reliable things sitting in the rack of course computer hardware usually only has a shelf life of years im with you on the job even if robots replace all the other jobs somebody still needs to maintain the robots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,show me a robot who can reseal a toilet or pull out old household wiring and run new cabling and ill be truly worried about the trades even then if they had a robot who could build or stain a deck for a long time people would still rather pay the money to say it was done by hand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,machines as we know them i mean this in the politest possible way but i think its quite likely we know different machines a computer program will never know what questions to ask in the field yes yes they will actually this is one of the things theyre best at thats why twenty questions was one of the first complex games to solved by computer programs weve all seen this popular version httpenakinatorcom its using a fairly simple sorting system to determine which question is going to split the group into the largest diversity ie as close to a split as possible so itll analyse all the possible options and decide that testing to see if there is a hum noise or not will split the remaining possibilities then next it checks the remaining to see which is the most efficient solution computers have been doing this in really complex ways for a long time now because its the fundamentals of error checking and exception capture there are some really clever methods thatve been devised modern neural network based systems do a really clever thing of developing their own heuristics and error checking routines when they encounter new situations they have really clever ways of learning how to cope with them or handling them into a handling routine a thousand guys replaced by one in india who also manages six other factories in other tabs id be interested in hearing which types of high skill labour will think will still be in demand twenty years from now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,arguments are the spice of life and the best way to get new perspectives thats why i like reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my googling to double check the spelling has fooled you all mwahahaha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,holy shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rbettereveryloop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i played war thunder once i know how to fly a
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive landed in red barron after wings were torn off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most popular questions get quality answers eventually but it sometimes takes hours and dozens of deleted comments for that to happen if i like a question i keep it open in another tab and check back later you simply need to be patient
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most of the questions i follow get answered it might take them over hours however ive gotten questions answered a week later
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no ive seen dozens of videos where they spell it flaired
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought it was good was it good for you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the robot uprising would happen if they realized they had to do the prep work for painting a house and then wed all be doomed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,flag memes are best memes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i flew a kite once call me up to the cockpit if the pilots ate the fish
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its something that works really well on a site like reddit you have various subs for various audiences want jokes about history theres a sub for that want an actual correct answer to your history question theres a sub for that too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont get me wrong i agree but it seems like in the past they allowed more good if not great answers with maybe one or two sources and some speculation now its great or go home it is probably better honestly but id like to have some kind of answer to the question
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and ive seen dozens of flares from the left front seat theres no i in flared
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think flair as in personal style makes more sense than flare as in a flaming stick used on the side of the road
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it surely come from to gradually become wider at one end like flared pants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think flare as in the motion used when landing a plane to cut off its lift makes more sense after watching thousands of videos from the left front seat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,apparently any word can mean what ever you want it to mean because english changles baby
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh please theres always some goon talking about linguistic drift like they have the first clue go away i always appreciate when someone disputes a dictionary definition with this sort of logic they end up saying something like the dictionary just hasnt caught up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im surprised that people get so butthurt about this this is great drama haha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aussie refers to a citizen of the country australia or anything that is connected to australia eg the aussie dollar the colloquial way to refer to our bloody brilliant country is straya mate if you wish to dispute my description of straya as bloody brilliant you can choose between the genocide of the indigenous people our treatment of refugees or our action regarding climate change
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aussie or ozzie is australian slang for australian and less commonly australia ive never heard it used to refer to the country but according to wikipedia it is albeit less commonly used to refer to australia probably best to just go with what ever an australian says it correct though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like looking through a window at a quivery homunculus that was beautiful
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like ceddit has stopped working
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im australian and have never heard the country itself called aussie were aussies the country isnt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,used very commonly in south east asia singapore especially thing is were not adopting australia slang calling australia aussie is just an example of how our dialect creates diminutives the fact that it has a different but similar meaning is just convergent linguistic evolution
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we say it all the time in new zealand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,changles oh so were making words up as well now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its english their our know rules
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that has to happen at least some of the time dictionaries add and change definitions constantly for them to change or add to a definition there has to have been a point the word was used that way before they caught up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its funny isnt it theyll argue about anything in years god only knows what aussie will mean but you can be damn sure millions of morons will be arguing about another word and becoming furious and hopefully well be here watching
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you forgot your closing parentheses you tazzwazzling didgeridoo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aussie being used to refer to the country itself is really common in nz
SubredditDrama,not_removed,here in nz we sometimes call the country aussie but thats just because we cant say to many syllables in a row before our brains overheat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can see where there might be a bit of confusion though my dad definitely says oz and i cant remember the last time i called tasmania anything other than tassie in casual conversation and with how diminutives are structured ill admit if one of my friends said they were going to go to aussie itd get a hard what from me in response
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive heard several people with shit english say aussie instead of australia mostly for the same reasons they mess up the rest of their grammar shit english its a mistake to be corrected not an enshrined local dialect
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the fact that it has a different but similar meaning is just convergent linguistic evolution i thought this was a christian sub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in kiwi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stop censoring me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a perfectly cromulent word
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dam theyre you go blowing mind
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aussie culture is so diverse that it will mean different things to different people in every state and territory
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds about right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you need to corulate yourself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i should be a rocket surgeon
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aussie aussie will be so aussie aussie will aussie aussie aussie to aussie aussies in every aussie and aussie ftfy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well heck id vote for you

SubredditDrama,not_removed,playing makebelieve terrorist thatll certainly bring people to your cause radical politics is basically a real life rpg for neets
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tldr nazis have their party shutdown due to threatenings of terrorist acts im sure both sides will be understanding if each other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh germany the country that keeps on giving httpenwikipediaorgwikinipster
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nazi hip hop would be a thing to see
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah theres nazi rappers theres jihadi rappers etc hate groups will coopt any popular style of music to get their bullshit out there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im pretty sure you can find black supremacists in the hip hop scene id call a supremacist a fascist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsarchiveisuqitw
SubredditDrama,not_removed,metal has a ton of nazi and white supremacist music or people in the bands dont necessarily sing about it but do believe it and espoused it for some reason these bandspeople are invited to mainstream festivals and concerts that makes people angry because yknow nazis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,auschwitz
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought the claim was that the radical left were brainwashed students taking social science degrees now its folks who arent in education
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tfw world war ii was extremists on both sides with a large pool of moderates in the middle smugly telling them that there was no reason to be fighting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tiltoo outside of germany the term nipster has been used with different meanings including asian hipsters and fans of male breasts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nipsters rather than rejecting modern pop culture seek instead to hijack it to promote neonazi ideals this has also been seen in the new right and national anarchism movements this is why anarchists are hard on each other you never know when theres some nazi in disguise trying to spread intellectual poison or to hijack some movement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what the article lists die ärzte who are one of the most popular german pop punk bands ever their biggest hit actually being as rap groups plus calling the eagle the ultimate nazi symbol without any context httpsenwikipediaorgwikicoatofarmsofgermanyfederalrepublicofgermany anyway an actual german nazi rapper if anyones curious apparently he started out as a stalinist of sorts before switching to the nazis a few years ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on the contrary it would be a thing to nazi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whitest kids you know did a hitler rap video
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who are you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,especially black metal most of the other subgenres are often and vocally antinazi but httpsenwikipediaorgwikinationalsocialistblackmetal in the quite a few black metal musicians that are still popular today were arrested for hate murders burning down churches and other niceties of course youve got black heh sheep everywhere but black metal and ironically punk rock are the only two genres that i associate with having an explicitly extremeright subculture thats not to say that all or even most black metal and certainly not punk fans hold these ideologies but that there are extremeright scenes formed around these genres only with punk its not as noticable because the left to extremeleft following is much bigger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that doesnt justify bomb threats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is kinda weird if you think about it nazism was all about respecting the laws and authority and having a powerful state that was allowed to dictate everything about your life with a supreme leader you couldnt disrespect and citizens were supposed to be clean ordered and always perfect thats basically the opposite of metal metal music would be straight up illegal under nazism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a big tent though if youre asserting that a career barista is capable of making bomb threats i concede that it is possible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just want to thank uyesthisisdrake for starting us on this magical journey of learning
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bravogif
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if i were to hazard a guess id say he is the mechanic for the bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its so weird how forgiving black metal fans are of the nazis that plague the whole scene even amongst people who really dont believe in any of that crap i get the idea of seperate the views from the art kind of thing but every other subgenre is very unforgiving of that shit and thrives just fine just look at the backlash phil anselmo got for that stupid stunt he pulled his already dwindling career is basically done but a black metal band could practically put out a manifesto about how they want to murder all homosexuals and its just met with well i mean if you ignore that their music is pretty good how can you ignore shit like that good god i think varg is an incredibly fascinating human being and not in a way that makes me look at his views and agree more in a what the fuck is wrong with this guy and why on earth does he still have a following way and he is the face of black metal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,farright punk is entrenched enough that one of the best known dead kennedys songs is about it punk is more populist than anything else and you dont have to get too far into the scene to be aware of the nazi faction there are still more white supremacists in punk than in congress
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id argue that the two are kind of different issues in that while the norwegians were crazy and racist as hell they were crazy and racist on their own terms while nsbm started around the same time in france and those guys were organized fascists who decided to use music as a rallying flag the norwegian scene guys that are still around dont touch that stuff any more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this shit is why i cant get into black metal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,especially black metal irony not just a way to describe how iron tastes anymore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,punk really ive listened to the stuff for years not that im exactly a connoisseur and never really seen it im curious though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really why not we actually do bomb the propaganda stations of other groups that want to commit genocide and ethnic cleansing like isis but suddenly when we want to fight white supremacists its not okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,graveland has a lot of ties with national socialist black metal bands and is often considered a nsbm band itself even though the frontman rob darken denies it case in point nbsp nbsp
SubredditDrama,not_removed,graveland has a nazi front man apparently they dont sing about it directly but theyre super popular among the nazi metal head contingent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nazism is not about respecting laws the ruling authorities in fascist states always act in ways unrestrained by any human or divine law nazism is fundamentally about the military dominance of the aryan race in a nihilistic social darwinist struggle for power with other races anything that aids the racenation in its struggle is good and lawful and anything that goes against it is bad and criminal your misconception exists because the allies couldnt draw attention to their own white supremacist tradition when fighting the fascists in wwii so they interpreted fascism as merely the unfree antithesis of their supposedly freedomloving selves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fascism is at its root about saying this should be done but x is preventing it its present when people complain about the legal system stopping what has to be done when people complain about health and safety or about how pc culture prevents common sense actions like deporting all muslims fascism is at heart antirestriction it seeks to completely free the force of the state from everything that constrains it it tells people that what is wrong with the nation is obvious and the obvious solutions are prevented by minority interests and asks to be free to eliminate them blind adolescent antiauthoritarianism is the root of fascism its also something the right seeks to exploit about the young people who are interested in punk thankfully theres lots of punk bands who recognise where power lies and choose to oppose that rather than recruit people into the farright reddit could learn from them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we learn something new everyday and maybe find new tastes wink wink
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see snapshillbot doesnt directly archiveis links but requires a user to click on that link and snapshill does that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just look at the backlash phil anselmo got for that stupid stunt he pulled the level of popularity is quite different when someone close to mainstream pulls shit like this they have mainstream fans to lose as well as the fact that news will spread much farther if a black metal band pulls this shit they might even gain fans because their fanbase is smaller than the number of wheraboos they can attract
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what did phil anselmo do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can we just vote in abbath or fenriz as the face of black metal instead
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the same reason people today still put fingers in their ears over micheal jackson
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but a black metal band could practically put out a manifesto about how they want to murder all homosexuals and its just met with well i mean if you ignore that their music is pretty good how can you ignore shit like that good god the same way reddit ignores td because of money and millions of other people ignore fascist propagandizing because of free speech its just modern liberal amorality and spinelessness in action
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the same way you can ignore music about torture misogyny murder or sexual abuse there are always gonna be people who take it seriously but for most its just entertainment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nazi punks isnt about actual nazis though its about elitism in the genre regarding sound and fashion jello himself said it there were very few nazi punks in the us at the time it only became an anti fascist song because of its popularity in places like south america and parts of europe were there actually were nazis in the scene
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the double standard in regards to metal always surprises me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nazi punks fuck off was written for a reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikinazipunk its difficult to talk about this stuff because punk has so many different meanings i probably shouldnt have mentioned it in one breath with black metal because the situations are vastly different black metal has a huge problem with ns ideology and is often associated with it some would say the very roots of the genre come from rightwing interpretations of paganism and satanism punk on the other hand has historically been adapted httpsenwikipediaorgwikipunkideologies the most prominent of which is the leftleaning to farleft one which is often meant when using the word punk to describe not just a style of music but a scene here in germany its definitely the case that rock and particularly punk rock are the neonazis most popular music genres its important to mention that leftleaning punk is far far more successful but i dont think theres another genre that is so popular with nazis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oi and rock against communism are two subgenres that have a decent sized naziwhite supremacist community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rkillthosewhodisagree
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think there has to be a test here before we can support stuff like that idiot nazi metalheads are probably just like the nazi punks vs anarchopunks plotline in slc punk in that theyre just violent thuggish idiots looking for a team to cheer for like soccer hooligans and couldnt organize their way out of a paper bag not much of a threat and we should be on guard for the potential consequences of turning politics into a contest of who can organize the most violence the skokie illinois nazis in the are also in this category this should be contrasted with bannon and the altright and the npi of spencer which do seem to be organizing and taking power while promising violence and other horrible fates to minorities and more and more in my mind should merit a response by antifa and i mean their usual response like breaking up that mussolinis restaurant meeting the same troubling consequences may apply but the threat is also much greater
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not all of them are nazis and even then it isnt a nazi propaganda event its a rock concert also the rights of white supremacists to say their terrible beliefs are protected under the first amendment and if we ignore that were no better than them edit stating my point better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rob darken
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and then theres varg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the ruling authorities in fascist states always act in ways unrestrained by any human or divine law how does that apply to musicians nazism introduced the reichsmusikkammer an institution with the job of controlling that no degenerate music was composed this included all music made by jews american music jazz blues and the music of political dissidents im fairly sure death metal would be on top of the list of degenerate music you say anything that aids the racenation in its struggle is good and lawful and anything that goes against it is bad and criminal what do you think that means if youre a common citizen that you can do whatever as long as you think its for the good of the state it meant that you had to shut up and do what the führer told you or get dragged to prison exiled or killed nazism was absolutely about respecting laws unless you were part of the elite and allowed to do pretty much whatever you wanted in private
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fascism is at its root about saying this should be done but x is preventing it where did you find this definition of fascism exactly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope this is more about male nipples and less about white nationalist hip hop but this is reddit so not really sure which
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah hes probably got a decent script going it just fucks up sometimes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hitler salute and white power shout on stage which you can see at the beginning of the video the rest of the video is a good commentary from machine heads robb flynn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gave a nazi salute i think
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or joe paterno or bill cosby or
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes the problem with the modern left is not enough censorship brilliant diagnosis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that makes me appreciate the song a lot more it always seemed like too much anger for such a silly phenomenon anger better reserved for jerry brown s punk definitely has a significant farright presence now though my highest exposure to the punk scene was in suburban chicago which isnt a noted nazi haven and there were abundant nonironic skrewdriver fans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,huh which double standard
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its certainly interesting i guess counterculture can also come about as nazism though the left leaning varient always struck me as the more prominent so i was surprised
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is why people associate skinheads with nazis when racist skinheads splintered off the original nonracist skinhead subculture
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because theyll do it first so might as well beat them to being fascist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and even then it isnt a nazi propaganda event its a rock concert yes one that features nazi propaganda additionally were at war with isis we arent at war with white supremacists in our country we should be just like isis jihadism white supremacy is a morally depraved and illegitimate ideology that has just bullshitted its way to the highest level of political power in the nation peoples rights are in danger if you dont believe in defending civil rights and equality by force then you dont believe in them at all and despite their despicable beliefs their right to express them is protected under the first amendment that only means the government cant persecute them the common people on the other hand have a right to socially regulate their own private communities
SubredditDrama,not_removed,their right to express them is protected under the first amendment why should they have the protections they actively attempt to take from others
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vargs different in my eyes he wasnt actually part of the nazi movement just a sympathizer nsbm is an organized arm of nazis themselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,varg isnt a nazi somehow his beliefs are even dumber
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how does that apply to musicians simple music that spiritually weakens and degenerates the aryan race is banned and music that supposedly does the opposite is promoted nazi themed death metal would almost certainly have been embraced had it existed back then nazism was absolutely about respecting laws unless you were part of the elite and allowed to do pretty much whatever you wanted in private so in other words nazism was not about respecting laws
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i recognise it mostly but if you want to learn about fascism i would recommend primary texts and anatomy of fascism by robert paxton
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or kanye
SubredditDrama,not_removed,error deserves no rights
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that nazis are somehow worse than the wide range of music about torture rape or murder people who happily listen to songs with horrific lyrics about torturing women to death wont go near a band that sings about national socialism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah ironically skinheads originated from black ska culture
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is cool and all but i thought the srd crowd was against might makes right and the law of the jungle and whatnot which is why im so weirded out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no john you are the fascists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sometimes i feel like reddit is babbys first political thought and i dont mean you i mean the people youre satirizing kill them before they kill us is about the most basic tribal reaction is any situation and the vibe still kinda underlies the anarchical as opposed to hierarchical international system but in hierarchical domestic politics in stable countries the majority of people have realized thats not a good way to business all that does is result in a figurative arms race people rushing to kill their ideological enemies before they get killed themselves and ukaliyugaz is apparently grappling with that for the first time weird stuff
SubredditDrama,not_removed,socially regulating is not bombing im not denying that theyre terrible and should be boycotted im just saying that bomb threats for a group of people containing some white supremacists is also bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you are literally advocating domestic terrorism here just thought id remind you and everyone else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably because the only speech that needs defending is the speech that pisses people off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because everyone has those protections under the constitution and denying them based on political views is a dangerous slippery slope
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the only anatomy youre using is your own because your idea of fascism cames right out of your anal cavity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kanye raped someone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people who happily listen to songs with horrific lyrics about torturing women to death wont go near a band that sings about national socialism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the stuff i listen to is mostly along the lines of iron maiden or nekrogoblikon so while theres horror imagery there its most assuredly not glorifying murder or rape
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i really hope youre not trying to say that literal nazis are comparable to bands who write graphic lyrics for shock value
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you surprised that people who are big fans of horror movies dont also enjoy nazi propaganda and films like the birth of a nation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because the guys writing about violence for shock value in other genres arent serious you can safely assume that of them are not murderers and while im sure theres some nsbm bands doing it for shock value there are many more that are very much serious about it you dont see a guy from other subgenres going out and saying hey rape and murder is cool kids try it out except maybe gwar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there was an inspector george gently episode about that way before my time so it blew my mind i guess back then it was considered a militant genre thatd be like goosestepping to smooth jazz today
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not in a long time for the past few months people here have been advocating violence against those who disagree one pretty upvoted comment wished drug addiction on all trump supporters and of course there was a thread that defended racism against indian men because some of them are sexist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and then john was a nazi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but in hierarchical domestic politics in stable countries the majority of people have realized thats not a good way to business until you know they take over the federal government and really do try to deprive you of rights and equality or do you just not believe that human rights and egalitarianism and democracy are worth defending by force are you just some kind of nihilistic weenie who doesnt want any trouble and thinks appeasement will work
SubredditDrama,not_removed,socially regulating is not bombing have you ever wondered why the instinct to violence exists at all httpsaeoncoessayspeopleresorttoviolencebecausetheirmoralcodesdemandit if you dont believe in the enforcement of moral norms against those who would destroy them then how can you say you truly believe in objective rights or equality or any other moral norms at all im not denying that theyre terrible and should be boycotted chants and slogans do nothing boycotts only do a little historically the only way to get rid of fascism has been through violence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ha looks like im in good company then give me liberty or give me death patrick henry the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants thomas jefferson terror is only justice prompt severe and inflexible it is then an emanation of virtue it is less a distinct principle than a natural consequence of the general principle of democracy applied to the most pressing wants of the country robespierre if there is no justice there can be no peace martin luther king jr but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security us declaration of independence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why should their attampts to harm others be protected
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fascism isnt just a case of different political views theres no such thing as a fascist who says im a fascist but its okay if youre not fascists make coexistence impossible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ha okay so you deny that fascism seeks unrestrained power for the state and that they argue for that by presenting popular problems and saying they could solve it if given such power
SubredditDrama,not_removed,paxton is iterally one of the most prominent scholars on fascism in the world you really should read his book its fantastic and educate yourself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really when
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my own experiences talking to some metalheads
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some of the truly fucked up bands mean everything they say but that is besides the point my point is listening to extreme metal and being shocked and horrified at what you hear seems a bit naive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,depends on why they enjoy said movies some people view it as entertainment others view it as a look at the dark side of humanity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whos to say they arent serious some bands certainly are advocating what is in their music
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if clinton had won something tells me they wouldnt have been so kind to the protests and threats of violence a complete lack of self awareness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,always report comments that call for violence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one pretty upvoted comment wished drug addiction on all trump supporters lol from my observations its pretty apparent that this has already gotten to like well before the election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like you didnt read anything i wrote your answer is to kill them first that you think this is some informed enlightened thought is absolutely laughable what are you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,w e w when did srd go from mocking the absurdity of rpolitics style leftism and contrarianism to full out eclipsing it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,their attempts shouldnt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre not actively attempting to suppress other views right now to go after them now violently makes one no better than them and preemptive warfare never works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,replace fascism with communism and fascist with communist and watch how some people squirm and try to justify it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is how they get into power once they are in power pointing out problems becames highly illegal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sure there might be some but i can guarantee you the amount of that vs the amount of guys in black metal bands advocating white nationalistnazi views is significantly higher thats just how black metal is and it attracts those kinds of views at a higher rate the biggest name in black metal is varg vikernes and he is a truly awful human being
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a complete lack of self awareness its kind of key to the whole mess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i do and you guys do a good job of trying to rein in your userbase but im becoming convinced its beyond saving
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i never said to kill them first im really arguing for something quite uncontroversial that it is morally permissible to use violent physical force to resist and undermine fascist ideology besides whats your solution singing kumbayah impotent chants and slogans bending over and letting the fascists have their way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look im far from in a position to do stuff like that right now im just interested in convincing people of the basic philosophical justness of force once militias actually do start forming in defense of the rights and safety of oppressed people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when cb shut down for the summer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when did srd go from mocking the absurdity of rpolitics style leftism and contrarianism to full out eclipsing it months ago or so the election amplified it a bit but its been pretty bad here for a while
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe when we all realized they may have been right all along its time to stop mocking and start thinking and doing start sobering up and taking things seriously for once politics isnt all about fun and rightwing extremism especially isnt just some kind of big joke its literally left western civilization in ruins before even if im wrong id rather follow the precautionary principle and be wrong as churchill than wrong as chamberlain
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats all fascists do fascists dont fundraise for charity fascists dont try to educate people fascists dont work to help people every aspect of their identity as fascists is harming people who dont conform to their ideals thats what fascism is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats all fascists do thats what makes fascism fascism again theres no such thing as a fascist whos cool with nonfascists why should they be allowed to bide their time until they actually decide to do what they said they would when they declared themselves fascists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes of course i wasnt claiming that fascism in power encourages opposition fascism as a ruling ideology is very different from fascism as an oppositional or insurectionist force
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think he is strictly a fascist either just a rightwing authoritarian but the people who support him are a different story his campaign was utterly suffused in protofascist sentiment one more terrorist crisis or economic crisis and i wont be surprised if they go full nazi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cant argue that varg is pretty scummy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats sad your face is sad yes i was making a sad face in reaction to the sadness i experienced while thinking about ur sad life thats gotta be the worst comeback ive ever seen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,neither of them is very good at this whole slapfight thing no creativity no energy no impact
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and ur so sad and pathetic thats the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me i think im in love marry me i like women sorry thats ok your attitude clearly indicates what youre missing in life is a dick up your ass like being in middle school all over again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,soooooooooo is it the fish or the dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i get it though this guy looks terrifying something is just completely off about him mostly the eyebrows
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt we already have a thread about rdrunkorkid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,worst or best
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like women sorry followed by thats ok your attitude clearly indicates what youre missing in life is a dick up your ass seems to have made an impression on the op because they made a pegging request thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its like a slapfight but both participants are mr burns its hilarious to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the full thread is better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,except that other guy did realize that he was missing a dick up his ass
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tucking your hoodie into your shorts is pretty alien dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the blond eyebrows my dad has the same problem when your brows and lashes are the same color as your skin you kind of look like a real life bad photoshop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is bad they have nothing better they couldnt even make it to darby street
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know about that look at that fish no a single inorganic piece of anything on him it could be the alien from the thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if hes wearing socks with sandals someone call area
SubredditDrama,not_removed,million dollars on the line and theres a gentlemans agreement to not use certain strategies sounds crazy to me they should be playing to win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what did do that was cheating
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the difference in community response between this and other games when underdogs beatalmost beat top teams really is telling to the maturity of the players
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those posts seem to be salty about their fav not crushing the worst and i dont follow esports or even really like it that much but in most other games people would have loved the best getting shown theyre not untouchable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i used to follow all the major esports but something about the call of duty scene just annoys me more than anything else the fans are so demanding and rather unpleasant i sense the aftermath of all this is caused by optic winning pretty much all the time generating a large fanbase and now that fanbase getting upset because their team didnt do too great also the idea of a competitive scene is to see whos the best for something having gentlemans agreements to not use certain strategies is sort of contradicting the first statement you should play your best in any way possible while following the rules
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all im taking from this is that cod seems like a worse competitive game than mario kart
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everything about that community sounds just stupid to me if you dont want certain things in a game then ban them if you cant then get good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont understand any of this but that sub seems to be all up in arms over this gaming has changed man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i clicked the first np link with visions of codpiece competitions dancing in my head i was sorely disappointed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is like when kabuum did the thing except they actually won underdog victories are nice in the way they shake things up a little and make stat geeks sweat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was just explaining the httpenwikipediaorgwikicodwars to someone after iceland upset england iceland hasnt embarrassed england this badly since the cod wars so initially had a different impression of what what rcodcompetitive was going to be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,add to the list of why cod will never be taken seriously they can pour as much money as they want into it but its still a joke the black ops hay days are over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is stupid if its in the game and isnt prohibited by the tourney rules its fair game the problem seems to be with the meta of the game being absolute trash and the balance being poor people should be pissed at activision for either having a poor ruleset or balancing the game poorly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can someone what went down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly i find it bewildering that all game mechanics wouldnt be open to use it seems like part of the competition should be knowing all the different weapons perks and how they can be used especially when theres millions on the line
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no offense but if the best team in the league loses to the worst team in the league because theyre forced not to use what theyre used to are they really the best team hmmmm
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man this makes me really appreciate the dota meta and strategies the idea of certain bans being unsportsmanlike is insane
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cod makes people so mad even in this thread different reasons but still everybody is suddenly an expert on competitive shooters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how does one play competitive cod when the game has a month window before its predecessor comes out is it the same people switching to each new iteration
SubredditDrama,not_removed,beat optic what the fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair are fucking scumbags this is the team that rage quit a lan match unprofessional idiots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if it wasnt against the law id stab someone for million dollars in any place you want
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im confused are they complaining because a team wants to win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so called scrubs always complaining about cheap strategies spaming good moves and what not you find a lot of them in fighting games and rts games
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think these people are just angry that cods compressed skill gap is ruining conpetitive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah thats the kind of thing you leave up to the dev team to balance if its op it should be fixed not ignored
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what i was thinking if you think someone is going to stick to some agreement with on the line then youre naïve you have to expect that someone is going to throw it in your face
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so there was no cheating going on in this match but some optic fans are upset that they used special abilities that most teams agreed to not use was also using certain weapons that you dont see like shotguns and light machine guns so no actual cheating but some fans are upset with the actions of thieves others are happy to be seeing variety in the game and a team able to keep optic on their feet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously why not go for the underdog why are people so on the top teams dick
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right there with you on the second part
SubredditDrama,not_removed,time trials are actually pretty competitive in mario kart i mean the community is really nice and its mostly competing against yourself but mario kart still has an active community in fact they have a world championship next month
SubredditDrama,not_removed,worse than monopoly even
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres a reason a lot of people jumped ship a few years ago and started playing csgo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree git gud
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gaming gaming never changes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no competitive cod has always been dumb as bricks if you cant play the game as it is and win then you arent a pro whats the point of watching something thats so far detached from the actual game some rules make sense if something is ridiculously op say noobtubes in everything not banned in the rules should be fair game especially when theres money on the line
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its hilarious im glad the bottom team could bring some heat to the number
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am sorry bb what can i do to assuage the dissapoint
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im still pretty confident that kabuum taking down alliance isnt going to be touched in terms of upsets in competitive league for a long while it was such a perfect mix of perceived strength disparity the european super team vs the wildcard that hadnt even won a game and high stakes even better alliance played really overconfident and got absolutely styled on it was beautiful
SubredditDrama,not_removed,never forget tyloo vs lg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ohhhh hahahahaha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sorry are you saying black use a sniper like a shotgun ops is considered a good competitive shooter lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,worst team versus best team they play first match normally worst team gets stomped going into second match worst team bans weird stuff that messes with best team best team now has to make new classes to work and worst team wins second and third game by doing this best team wins game and then game goes to overtime people are upset that worst team did weird stuff that they are not used to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some of them would be way too over powered that it would end up being the only thing you see
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people know things that i dont bs lets call them posers to assert dominance also you forgot to call them weaboos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,successor not predecessor predecessor is the previous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes the pro scene stays more or less the same with some new coming in each year some pros are just bad at certain cods too so that might send them off their team
SubredditDrama,not_removed,came very close to it game round they really should have won but johnny got hitmarkers on formal with a kuda somehow from feet away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only one of their players rage quit from that lan and he was not playing today rosters are locked but we can assume that he will be off the team as soon as possible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not being allowed to stab people is a good law i think
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lets have a gentlemans agreement not to stab anybody but if you do you win million dollars
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so its not two million but ive got three hundred dollars and this annoying coworker
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seems like theyre complaining that the bad team is playing in a way which makes them likelier to win which makes no sense to me if the worst team is playing competitively with the best team doesnt that imply that these two teams are of comparable quality
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is exactly why i dont play fighting or rts games online it just turns into the same game every time spamming special moves or racing to build of catapults
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like a terribly balanced competitive game if you need an agreement to not use weapons or perks that are in the game especially if youre already pickbanning perks if theres no rules against it and both teams can utilize them go for it not surprised the competitive cod scene is shitty though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whenever i see something like this i cant help but be reminded of my first forays into online gaming via i dont know if its still the case on bnet today but back then youd see the odd match with rules in the title like no flying units or no magic sometimes id join and invariably one or several players would break this agreement and stomp any other player that hadnt anticipated this breach of trust the remaining players would then duke it out within the confines of the game itself while the gentlemen were left crying in the ashes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no shotguns or lmgs whats the reasoning behind that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they want to identify with the top teams so they pick up their manners and customs and conventions and then hate on the team that doesnt follow them if the roles were reversed can you imagine them standing up for the little guy who stuck to the unwritten rules and got destroyed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,optic is a lot like the yankees or chelsea fc in this scene people like them because they win and win a lot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know a thing about cod either whats the item that got banned and that people are upset about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what about team we taking down the tigers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah i think he is implying that black ops ii was the last call of duty to be any fun to play a month after release
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like a good strategy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but there would be counters that everyone starts running with and then counters to those counterslike keeping up with that meta is part of the competition
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then you explicitly ban those strategies if necessary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah youre right but im leaving it probably some sweet pieces out there who are into shitty grammar and this gonna get their bits in a tizzy and then i can swoop in and woo them with my improper comma usage and malapropisms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sure if you hate freedom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if we made stabbing illegal only criminals would be able to stab then what kind of a world we would live in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everyone knows you cant legislate morality
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but for £ id risk it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stabs people in two minutes no more for me guys will pay for funerals if it makes everyone feel better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dat username
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the problem is there are alot of things that are legal because activision said theyre legal in order to bring competitive call of duty to a broader audience is a relatively new team but just like at one of the most recent events have acted extremely unprofessional and childish well what else would you expect from a call of duty player harhar they have the worst record in the league and have no chance at cod champs so pretty much they are using the annoying shit to play to win the reason it worked is because if you play a meta that nobody plays or has played then theres a chance the community is just mad because those builds werent supposed to be originally in the rule set all pros agreed on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fyi thats exactly the scrub mindset that ufiodorson was talking about httpwwwsirlinnetptwbookintroducingthescrub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cs had one piece of equipment the riot shield that was so out of place that it was generally banned by tournament rules but thats it if the game has an issue of that kind its up to the tournament organisers to make preemptive rules if its so complicated that the game can be broken regardless the game is fucked up although there is a worse case and that is aoe both players have wild animals around their starting location that they can hunt for food pro players know how to push or pull these animals towards their bases giving shorter ways and therefore higher efficiency to their workers in collecting the meat so it is possible to hamper the opponent by killing their animals before they have been pushed they also begin to decay lose food value after they die because there is little to no counterplay to that its generally regarded as bm this is something thats just too deep in the game mechanics and with too destructive consequences for both sides
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like a terribly balanced competitive game have you played cod
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like a terribly balanced competitive game if you need an agreement to not use weapons or perks that are in the game yes but if you say this about super smash bros people will argue with you until the next nintendo console comes out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hearing the complaints reminds me of playing smash bros with people who when they refer to smash bros actually mean final destination no items stock with a heavy implication that only characters are even acceptable picks if you need to twist the meta into a pretzel just to make it work for you maybe find a thing less torturous to like edit hi im robotronica you might remember me from such comments as this one apparently some people are really bothered by my comment and how it inaccurately portrays competitive smash bros culture to those people id like to say i never mentioned competitive play and i think weve all had a judgey friend who tells us how were having the wrong sort of fun if you can find it in your heart to forgive me please send an anvil to mark mcconville co pistol shrimps radio po box los angeles california if however you find this misinterpretation unforgivable i await your down votes and probably also some pms of butts and curse words
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i totally agree pokemon is a terribly balanced game but players have created rulesets that reduce the randomness smogons the most famous example but theres multiple communities and each have their own rulesets with their own bans tournaments hosted by these communities use the communitys ruleset if your tournament doesnt have a rule banning x you have no right to complain when people start using x to win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like a terribly balanced competitive game if you need an agreement to not use weapons or perks that are in the game especially if youre already pickbanning perks im confused why wouldnt everybody just use those things
SubredditDrama,not_removed,repurposing a broadaudience massappeal game for competitive play like that seems perfectly fine to me i still think its completely unwatchableawful as an esport
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these match titles were a big red flag saying noobs here we are really bad at this game so naturally they attracted griefers who enjoy destroying bad players
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah yes the classic days of starcraft zero clutter no rush minutes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seems to me that pvp games should have the ability to present all the players before the game starts with a modifiable list of things that are allowedprohibited everyone has to agree on the changes before starting the game and then the software enforces it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well shotguns tend to be hit kills and not need much skill to use effectively so teams avoid using them as they can be a bit unfair however they are in the game and not expressly banned by the league so they are fair game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,guess theres bandwagoners no matter what kind of sports youre watching
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it was multiple things that people took as thieves being jokey and not caring which turned out to be them doing whatever they could to win for example lots of sights and a grip so that most ars were useless and they were using a specialist called rejack that is heavily frowned upon because it lets you come back to life where you died if you use it within seconds of dying
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what about tpa beating moscow granted knowing what we know now they werent exactly underdogs but at the time it was a mindfuck since many people believed was just waiting to claim their title
SubredditDrama,not_removed,black ops is good though basically only treyarch makes good cod games past
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stop forcing your morals on me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a world of old people to make children men have to stab vaginas so we have a future of criminal children d
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shit dude nobody said anything about killing them just stab them in the foot or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but cheap funerals no open bar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shouldnt they be mad at activision for the shitty ruleset and not the team who just used every tool they could to win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the reason it worked is because if you play a meta that nobody plays or has played then theres a chance then they are ahead of the curve in the meta if it can beat the current meta then its the new meta
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they should still be allowed to use them though using different strategies is one of the best ways to advance the metagame games get stale when strategies dominate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well what else do you expect from a call of duty player
SubredditDrama,not_removed,does activision set the rules for this pro league why not just make it a full ban instead of a gentlemans agreement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and dont really care i dont play competitively i play games to have fun you all can play games any way you want i dont complain ingame i just move on i certainly wont come up with a negative nickname and write paragraphs on why your style of play isnt correct
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait hold up aoe has a pro scene
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you literally couldnt buy the shield on any competitive server esea cevo cal ogl whatever most server cfgs disallowed it for private servers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because there is little to no counterplay to that its generally regarded as bm ban material what is bm cant drop an acronym like this and expect us to know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cs had one piece of equipment the riot shield why was it op that sounds like it would be very interesting to watch like a wild card strat a team pulls off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,condition zero had the riot shield not didnt it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god no why would i do that nah seriously though i havent played a significant amount of cod since like i played the new one when it was on a free weekend on steam and good god was it bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt it just tournament rules to not use items rather than some agreement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can disable items via in game options explicitly which is different than a gentlemens agreement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,with a heavy implication that only characters are even acceptable picks where did you hear that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you need to twist the meta into a pretzel just to make it work for you maybe find a thing less torturous to like in the pokémon metagame i think it could have been salamence was banned well moved to uber tier disallowing it from most games the reasoning was that every team was salamence two salamence counters two salamence countercounters and one wild card i understand that it was working fine and the rules were amended to make the game more interesting and diverse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,with a heavy implication that only characters are even acceptable picks amsa is going to be surprised to learn that he is breaking some sort of unspoken agreement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you clearly dont play smash competitively or watch it nobody would get on you for playing an offmeta character and the only reason items and lots of stages are banned is because they have too much rng involved smash is not only played on final destination and there are at least common tourney picks in melee if you stretch common out of characters banning rng is not twisting the meta into a pretzel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then what is the point of the competition then it seems kinda meaningless at that point if they are so gentlemanly and dont do these effective techniques if this was in something like say banning the instead of something odd like marathon would seem like a legitimate strategy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats so stupid if theyre overpowered then they should be banned if theyre not banned and are really strong then use them sounds like the entire cod competitive scene is just run by httpwwwsirlinnetptwbookintroducingthescrub but i suppose that isnt a huge surprise its not like cod games have a lot of competitive depth to them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well shotguns tend to be hit kills and not need much skill to use effectively so teams avoid using them as they can be a bit unfair what what the hell kind of tournament completely gets rid of shotguns theyre already hamstrung by the fact the barrel of the gun needs to be in the mouth of the person youre shooting at can competitive players really not handle that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats so ridiculous to me as a casual player because i hated shotguns not because i got murdered with them which i did regularly but because they have such a specific range its like yeah youll get a one hit kill or youll be out of range and do absolutely nothing but give your position away not saying theyre bad weapons at all just that i sucked with them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is pretty ridiculous ive watched a few of the matches out of curiosity to see how they play and everyone pretty much goes for the same guns shotguns are definitely not one of the easiest weapons to use in that game anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what makes rejack good in competitive in standard play its rarely used as it got nerfed into oblivion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks for the explanation so theyre blamed for repeated acts rather than one particular thing sound like assholes or trolls but hey if they follow the rules i find it rather funny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,was decent i guess i enjoyed multiplayer for a bit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,uyesthisisdrake is forcing his antistabbing agenda down throats virtue signalling virtue signalling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpiimgurcomkbcwliojpg
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there was so much going on at the beginning of the game that i cant put it all into one thread or else it would be a mile long but let me sorta summarize pros and david vonderhaar sorta the head honcho over at treyarch were trying to come to an agreement on rules but vondy was going to have it his way quote arent pro players supposed to be able to adapt community split in two lots of arguing the biggest problem with these rules is it allows the skill gap to close making teams like viable gentlemens agreement were then in effect between pros but those were actually banned and those who did it were fined or banned from the league pros at this point have real choices a deal with the rules or b quit but they also have c use only whats respectable c isnt supposed to exist but it does because thats what is saving the competitive scene so thats what theyve been going by since the beginning with this deviance though the community is just annoyed but they also hope it doesnt lead to other teams following in the same feet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes they do theres types of bans in the game universal bans and preround bans universal bans are set by the developers which covers very little of the available arsenal so it includes a lot of nooby choices premap bans are bans that the players do ingame before each map each member of every team gets the ban one weapon perk specialist etc the problem with this is the fact you cant ban all the bad stuff so you choose to ban against players strengths player x is really good with this smg so we are going to ban that so he is forced to use another viable gun the only thing stopping these players from not using these extremely overpowered guns and extremely annoying guns is this general respect among players to not use them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,david sirlins point was that people who play for fun are actually missing the orders of magnitude more fun parts of the game because of their selfimposed limitations unless the game is really broken which most competitive games obviously arent then every op strategy has its counters which in turns have their counters and its figuring them out and figuring out which the opponent might use so which you should use is where the actual strategic depth lies i recently read that whole book despite not even playing games much these days much less competitively and i enjoyed it a lot funny how it was an accident more or less someone on slatestarcodex linked to the chapter which explained why the counter to counter to counter thing usually has three and only three distinct levels and that was an insightful enough observation that well i read the whole thing would recommend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,here is some it was never as big as scbw or but the aoe competetive scene has been ongoing for a long long time i think they switched to aoe and maybe some other parts from time to time but at the very least since hd there was some comeback for good old aoe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just head over to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on youtube uploads promatches regularly from aom the titans too voobly is used to play the game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry it originally ment bad manners bm is now also used as a verb though so it kind of became its own term
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bad manneredmanners
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably bowel movement if i had to guess
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpcounterstrikewikiacomwikitacticalshieldtrivia but as said it was disabled on most servers anyway so it could rarely be used
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes it is there are also rules against certain stages both of these are for the purpose of minimizing random chances effect on the game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some morecasualthantheyrealize types look at a tier list and think it means you shouldnt play anybody whos not super high up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,salty bayonetta players probably
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only note that this was in smogon an independent website that has nothing to do with nintendo vgc still only bans event legendaries
SubredditDrama,not_removed,banning one pokemon isnt really comparable since it is just removing one piece of many and not inventing a whole new rule set a better comparison would be the invention of the pokemon tier system itself but competitive smash is arguably still bigger departure from the base game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also axe plup wizzy and a fuckton of the top
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly my thoughts i love seeing new stuff
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats probably the most self righteous article ive read in a long time talk about a straw man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sounds like the entire cod competitive scene is just run by scrub mentaility of course it is if they were actually any good theyd be playing counterstrike since thats where the most money is scrub games attract scrub players news at
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a scrub is a player who is handicapped by selfimposed rules that the game knows nothing about a scrub does not play to win well i guess im a scrub i play to have fun and i do have a selfimposed set of rules win or lose i dont like to play an unbalanced match because its boring
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah smgs in are so much more powerful i wouldnt say shotguns are op just that these guys are not at all used to fighting them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cod is kind of a runandgun game though unless its changed a lot since i played it last there arent a lot of wide open spaces in their maps
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are cod games usually i would think on smaller teams that would be more of an advantage also a couple of the rules i found by just randomly googling enforce a respawn delay of seconds depending on mode might be good there too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so like the other guy said although it is having an extra life really helps if when you die your friend can take out the guy who killed you another specialist that was used and frowned upon was the hive which basically sets up or claymore like bulbs on the ground people dont like that guy and id agree that he should be banned but he never even got used effectively
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the pros typically dont win gunfights by much when you jump back up from rejack the other guy is usually shot whereas you have full health
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if their acts are in the pursuit of winning i dont even see them as trolls is it trolling to try
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i understand the situation vaguely it just seems like the competitive scene is run like shit in other games either the company actually tries to balance the game if theyre the ones running tournaments or the organization who runs the tournaments just implements bans and additional rules to make the game more competitive having to resort to gentlemans agreements to keep games well balanced when millions of dollars are on the line is fucking bonkers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so is the tldr is that activision is killing their competitive scene because this seems like if nintendo came into the smash scene and told people to turn on items
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the pros could now move to overwatch good luck there d
SubredditDrama,not_removed,david sirlins point was that people who play for fun are actually missing the orders of magnitude more fun parts of the game because of their selfimposed limitations and my point is that he is wrong he is assuming that everyone is the same or plays games for the same reason i play a game for the experience of playing not to figure out how to be the best player its figuring them out and figuring out which the opponent might use so which you should use is where the actual strategic depth lies it takes someone a few minutes to look online and find the best build for their character or the best move chain for a fighting game or follow the steps layed out in a strategy guide the game then becomes how well i can follow directions my son loves playing this way i dont its just not fun for me it ruins immersion a main draw for me and makes the game a chore again play the way you like but dont call how i play the wrong way thats just arrogance
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sweeeeet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right i remember now condition zero had it first then it was added to i remember having to disable it on my server
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they only do bans on stages everything else is tournament rules most stages are restricted anyways so stage bans dont always effect a whole lot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres no bans on characters they considered it for awhile with brawl metaknight but that wouldve been smart considering how that character destroyed the scene by being so overpowered its important everyone get to play their character although theres some debate on miis and custom moves i think its a silly debate since none of them are op on miis there is a legal map selection that tos make smash is competitive but its also a party game the maps that are clearly not competitive are not allowed although theres some disagreement about which those are and theres a selection of legal stages of those players pick and ban
SubredditDrama,not_removed,itll all end in tiers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly its not the competitive players its the wannabes with a chip who pull that stunt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if its stock im guessing he means melee so more like fox falco marth shiek and c falcs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought there was a wobbufett ban also to avoid struggle lock
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well the site theyre talking about has a tier system they solved the problem by moving the thing causing the problem up a tier i think i assume thats what uber means
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant believe you havent seen it before mentioning it is damn near the godwins law of competitive gaming ftr i think the article has some good points along with a ton of nonsense handwaving
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats sirlin in a nutshell
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not remotely if its not over centralizing you dont ban it and if its not banned its legitimate if you whine that something is cheap because you dont want to counter play it youre a scrub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well then that sounds like the perfect thing to beat them with in a tournament doesnt it unless its officially banned you better believe someone would use it million dollars is a lot of money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre right for sure but i mean you gotta be real close for that one shot with a shotgun you can play in a way to make that happen but its not all little hallways you can definitely play to your ar or smgs strengths too i just dont see it as anything unfair
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its best in the game mode where there is no respawn that way when the guy with rejack dies his friend who is next to him can kill the guy who killed him so when he rejacks they now have people to the enemys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only if you try in a way that nobody else does people like their meta if you win by breaking it its a coin toss if youre lauded as the progenitors of the new meta or those fuckheads who trolled the competition and brought down the quality of the entire tournament
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all stabs are equal but some stabs are more equal than others
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the biggest problem about call of duty is perception you look at csgo and other major competitive games the big teams are well mannered well respected guys i mean look at the subreddit and youll see that if a pro is being a bully hes lynched by the whole community because theyre better than that pro cod guys are absolutely awful about trash talking and immaturity yes its entertaining yes its very hyped but how does that look from the outside its not that they cant get a broader audience because oh shit we dont use the under barrel grenade launcher like every other pub player lets make it legal so they can relate its because the people in the spotlight are immature
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes and no the community is pretty split on the feelings of this game if you want my opinion every since we had boots off the ground the games have been a joke from the wall riding to the specialists its ridiculous as to how someone can not get angry from playing this but the community is also to blame too as its immature and complete vocal cancer competitive cod is just the gum on the shoe of all esports
SubredditDrama,not_removed,david sirlins point was that people who play for fun are actually missing the orders of magnitude more fun parts of the game because of their selfimposed limitations and my point is that he is wrong he is assuming that everyone is the same or plays games for the same reason i play a game for the experience of playing not to figure out how to be the best player you entirely ignored the statement you replied to your reply has nothing whatsoever with what i said how comes it takes someone a few minutes to look online and find the best build for their character or the best move chain for a fighting game or follow the steps layed out in a strategy guide the game then becomes how well i can follow directions if youre playing a game that has a competitive scene and you dont see everyone there following the same directions and only competing in how good they are at that then uh how comes again play the way you like but dont call how i play the wrong way thats just arrogance im not saying that youre playing it the wrong way im saying that your claim that youre playing it just for fun is not selfconsistent because youre playing it whatever it is in a way that doesnt nearly optimize for fun there are boatloads of fun youre missing and im saying that youre objectively wrong when you say that playing for the win means training to mindlessly follow the directions to execute the one and only winning build its completely the other way around its you who enjoys pointless clicking or buttonsmashing for the sake of it while the people who are better at whatever game have all rights to look down at you because they are winning with creativity while you are too closeminded to recognize creativity if it slapped you in the face i mean consider this you said that you dont like the strategy that involves making catapults and rolling over the enemy because its not fun and pretty much cheating using an over powered move i dont have a clue what game youre talking about here for the record but tell me what happens if you try to use this strategy and commit to using it at first you would be winning but then youd get matched with better players who would shut down your catapult strategy with their strategies not getting to catapults more efficiently than you nothing like that they will kill you before you have any catapults or when you have five catapults or twenty that would teach you how to win against the catapults and you will beat your son every time he goes for that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kinda funny how far back valves bad game design decisions go be it source cz or go i feel like valve is really damn lucky of being able to build on the awesome game concept provided to them by the original cs mod it seems like every conscious change they made to the game since then was either unimportant or completely bloody backfired see csgos constant issues with breakout op weapons the only real improvements they made was to add stuff outside the game offical servers matchmaking game modes and even there they screwed up some bits greatly like offering only tdm instead of the way more popular dm that is expected of modern games in terms of graphics i actually think it played out rather poorly playing go as an old player gives me a headache because the visuals are so unncessarily clustered with garbage had a way more pristine and colourful look
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably puff or peach instead of falcon though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats why i prefer smogon far more diversity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,xy and oras had a high number of bans the case youre mentioning was a ban o the ability shadow tag it was basically a guarantee that whatever pokemon from the opposing team the player wanted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah basically its absolutely guaranteed to be brought up in any competitive gaming discussion usually by the sweatiest metariding person in the discussion as an announcement that they have arrived
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if its not over centralizing you dont ban it and if its not banned its legitimate if its not over centralizing he said that you need to find the most overpowered thing possible and abuse it to death there was no unless its really really overpowered caveat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i didnt mean to say it was unfair its totally a tradeoff i dont use it myself because i also suck with it when i play arms race in counterstrike i often quickly get to the shotguns and then spend a lot of time trying to get shotgun kills except on lake where i have a couple good kill spots in the house
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people really did think it was bullshit when david slung a rock to kill goliath he definitely should have gone up against the giant with sword and spear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a good way to look at it i dont think what they did was bad i think teams need to be ready to play in different play styles if they want to be the best
SubredditDrama,not_removed,two stabs good four stabs better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only one csgo pro was lynched for being a bully and he is far from the most toxic of csgo pros hilariously the only reason it was such a big deal was because of how out of character it was for him and he was less talented than his victim if you ask me players like moe steel or even the dude he was yelling at make money off of yelling at people on stream everyday and they are celebrated though they are now retired banned and involuntarily teamless respectively
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait theres wallriding in cod now wtf
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you entirely ignored the statement you replied to your reply has nothing whatsoever with what i said how comes no i didnt you said what sirlins point was and i said his point was wrong his definition of fun isnt mine if youre playing a game that has a competitive scene and you dont see everyone there following the same directions and only competing in how good they are at that then uh how comes what im not saying that youre playing it the wrong way youre playing it whatever it is in a way that doesnt nearly optimize for fun there are boatloads of fun youre missing no because that boatload of other stuff isnt fun for me the funny part is that you follow im not saying that youre playing it the wrong way with a paragraph rant about how i am playing wrong and should be playing another way because that is what real fun is because its not fun and pretty much cheating i never said it was cheating i havent mentioned cheating at all thats your interpretation of what i said and its wrong and again i am saying its not fun for me for fucks sake just accept that not everyone enjoys the same thing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think you just dont really understand the experience this guy is speaking to why he would complain about spamming special moves and counters typically in strategically deep games at the lowest levels of play it doesnt really matter what youre doing you just kind of fuck around in a match and eventually someone wins this can be fun for new players that are just learning how to play or havent learned after slight improvement on the part of the player they will soon encounter slightly better opponents using first order optimal strategies strategies that have high degree of effectiveness but are easy to execute if you know how its a tricky design problem to ensure players learn how to advance to higher order strategies and get to fun you are talking about the game may not do a good job of teaching the player how to perform the foo or how to counter it the foo strategy may not be mechanically enjoyable so the player will have no desire use it as a stepping stone to better strategies the next best strategy may be substantially more difficult to execute but only provide a small increment in effectiveness particularly a problem with exceedingly powerful foo strats that punch way above their weight class one or several of these things can lead to a player quitting a game if the lowmid ranks of play are dominated by a foo strat and it could just seem hopeless or at least not worth it from a fun÷time perspective the reason the player initially had casual fun in matchmaking isnt there any more so why continue a httpsenwikipediaorgwikibartletaxonomyofplayertypes whill thrive anyways when faced with this sort of challenge but not everyone shares that personality trait or has the time to get deep into a strategy game calling another player retarded or belittling them for not being the same sort of player as you is just toxic mean and childish a about foo strats and strategic ballance if youre interested in that sort of thing i dont know if the whole foo concept was something you already knew since you mentioned reading a book about this stuff but if you did you should have been more understanding of the other commenters perspective not less
SubredditDrama,not_removed,csgos constant issues with breakout op weapons what the that lasted for all of a day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right i sometimes forget which are considered the competitive ones in melee but puff and peach have kinda risen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well isnt falco just bird fox
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i read the whole thing through before and there is a caveat that single page may not have it but it should be on the what should be banned chapter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wish i had a decent computer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for curiosity who was lynched by the comunity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,welcome to uh advanced warfare or so ever since that release theyve been putting it in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no i didnt you said what sirlins point was and i said his point was wrong his definition of fun isnt mine you never touched his definition of fun david sirlins point was that people who play for fun are actually missing the orders of magnitude more fun parts of the game because of their selfimposed limitations and my point is that he is wrong he is assuming that everyone is the same or plays games for the same reason i play a game for the experience of playing not to figure out how to be the best player how is that a response to what was said why do you think that the orders of magnitude more fun parts of the game figur out how to be the best player as a process or something if youre playing a game that has a competitive scene and you dont see everyone there following the same directions and only competing in how good they are at that then uh how comes what you pretty much said that you think that the fun as competitive players understand it is grinding the same set of moves implementing an overpowered strategy and then competing at how good they are at executing that strategy like your son beats you in whatever strategy game by making catapults and rolling you over youre not as good as he at making catapults fast enough so you lose and since you dont consider developing or using the skill of making catapults as efficiently as possible to be fun youd much rather play a game where youre not allowed to do that by a gentlemans agreement right so if that game is also played competitively by other people than you or your son ill bet my left testicle that if you check our how those competitive plays actually go nobody ever builds catapults ever never ever at all so your idea that playing to win in that game means training your skills at mindlessly executing the catapults play as perfectly as possible is wrong because none of the top players actually do that so playing to win must mean something different and you must be completely misunderstanding the game you are trying to play since you think that the catapults strategy is op and must be softbanned in order to have a fun play with a paragraph rant about how i am playing wrong and should be playing another way because that is what real fun is dude you can watch the wall until its time to go to sleep and call it fun for all i care im telling you that you started by explaining why playing to win is not your cup of tea and youd much rather play for fun and your explanation was that in your opinion playing to win means spamming special moves or racing to build of catapults a direct quote and thats objectively wrong because top players who play to win and do win dont do that i cant i cant even put in words how monstrously retarded your opinion is like i dont wipe my ass because people who wipe their asses just try to get as much shit on their hands as possible and id rather walk around with a buttswamp thank you very much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah i understand that its complicated stuff and that people are different and have different attitudes but there were several things that really got into my hair for starters its rare to find a foo strategy in a mature balanced game and im pretty sure that hundreds of catapults is not one despite still not having a clue which particular game that was if any as in its counter just go fucking kill him™ usually is not more mechanically challenging to execute than the strategy itself second it could have been excusable to get stuck because you dont know the counter and dont know that theres supposed to be a counter to some strategy in like but these days theres the internet out there the dude himself even said it takes someone a few minutes to look online and find the best build for their character or the best move chain for a fighting game or follow the steps layed out in a strategy guide the game then becomes how well i can follow directions but of course he never did that himself or hed have noticed the whole concept of counters yet hes sure that he understands whats up there in terms of skill when youre playing to win nothing but mechanically following directions i mean its not a case of youre paying the game wrong god knows i have no leg to look down on anyone about that these days its someone smugly saying completely wrong things on the internet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and the cz and the aug and the molotov and then there was a time at which machine pistols were generally ridiculous the point with either unimportant or backfired is that if at any random day they reverted all game mechanics back to cs the game would either be equally good when csgo happened to be decently balanced in that moment or better when csgo is in one of its weird imbalanced phases again the biggest thing about the was not so much that the game was imbalanced for a day but rather that it showed what a blatant missunderstanding the design team has of that game it was not just off balance it was absolutely ridiculous and anyone with the slighest bit of cs experience could see that on a first glance and with all of this nobody even knows why it even was added to begin with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,assuming youre not joking no even though the have the same moves visually they have very different damageknockback values and so end up playing very differently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it still reads as extremely self righteous self gratifying and insecure
SubredditDrama,not_removed,freakazoid who was playing for cloud at the time he blew up at a player known for toxicity who was popular at the time because he moved from europe to play with an american team and people thought he was gonna carry them na teams are notoriously mediocre a partial conversation was leaked and people got mad freaks pay was suspended for a month and he was required to attend an antibullying seminar by his employers sorry if this was wordier than you wanted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ey thanks for the answer very much apprecciated
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey lngram thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because while there is certainly potential for drama there currently pretty much everbody seems to agree with each other maybe you could hunt around for a thread where theres actual bickering going on currently its more nba drama than subreddit drama for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,remember everyone trump is simultaneously the peace candidate and at the same time will ruthlessly utilize the american war machine to crush our enemies both are true no arguing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,war costs money trump likes money war makes some people a lot of money some of those people are probably pretty close to the presidentelect funny how that works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you have no idea what i would be talking about if i tried explaining the balance of power in europe and what russianato polarity means to us would you the problem is that people like the guy theyre talking to dont even have a clue about the history of recent usrussia relations obama started his presidency wanting to turn a new leaf with russia and then russia did what it said it wouldnt do and didnt do what it said it would whenever it felt like it the republicans were complaining constantly how obama wasnt tough enough on russiaputin now trump wants to be besties with putin and suddenly it is the best thing ever do they expect that putin will keep his promises now any more than he did with obama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wtf is china gonna do load their people into cannons and fire them at us how can someone possibly be the this ignorant as to how powerful china is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how dare he not want to start that monster ah the ol trumparoo insinuating clinton is actively pursuing nuclear war to distract from trumps fawning servile admiration of putin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people can be so weird about their political figures there was an article saying that michelle as if there is shame in not being as smart as a princetonharvard law grad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is a difference between being friends with someone and not being an asshole to them but somehow that never applies to the democrats and saudi arabia that totally means theyre good friends and hillary supports everything the saudi do but if trump is allied with putin it just means hes doing it for convenience
SubredditDrama,not_removed,estonia and latvia arent shitholes but they and lithuania are very anticommunist and very much opposed to modern russia as well which they see as having territorial designs on their countries they were all part of soviet union this leads to the countries having generally very rightwing politics there is something of an irony in a trump supporter having such a kneejerk negative opinion of countries that probably have politics they would tend to approve of relative to many others in europe at least just because the countries are antirussia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you honestly think that then ive got a bridge in frisco that id love to sell you and ive got a wall to sell you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know but i believe calling trump a fascist is a bit of a stretch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can see the srd circlejerk ahead of time maybe im psychic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,american war machine are you a fucking idiot america is embroiled in the longest war in our nations history started by a republican and expanded by a democrat toppling governments that were only guilty of being oil producing countries bush and obama are owned by the same people the same people who own congress too wake the fuck up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre saying this after years of bush and obama foreign policy a bomb them into compliance approach fuck that shit years of clinton before that its time to take the country back
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you have now been made a moderator of rtrumpyongyang edit holy shit its real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,literally doublethink
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfvlcozlwte
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously its what bugs me when people keep saying clinton would start a war over syria like no of course not even if it did come to taking down russian planes that still isnt war maybe people get their idea from civ games where as soon as you cross territory or blow up someone elses stuff is a war declaration
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is no inbetween for a lot of people remember that a big portion of reddits user base is young and therefore a inexperienced and b undereducated in subjects like political science economics and sociology so allornothing attitudes are likely to prevail because thats all they understand they dont have the requisite knowledge to understand the subtleties and complexities of international relations im just educated enough to know that i dont know shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what a lot of trump supporters dont seem to understand about china is that it is acting in restraint in how it deals with us yes and no china is modern times have always had an inward look at things they dont care what any other country does as long as they let china do what china does but yeah china could fuck with the us much more then it does but that is not really chinas style
SubredditDrama,not_removed,war costs money trump likes money i feel like he knows this position is intellectually dishonest but said it anyway people getting rich from war is one of humanitys oldest pastimes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just ask dick cheney haliburton made a fortune thanks to the iraq war while he was vp
SubredditDrama,not_removed,war makes some people a lot of money rule of acquisition war is good for business
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not even the right framing we have no reason to think that trump has either the inclination or the stomach to start a war for profit if trump starts a war its going to be because he overreacted to a provocation which offended his sense of manliness or because he accidentally antagonized an adversary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,war takes the money from the taxpayers and funnels some of that directly into the pockets of a relatively few companies trump would love to be lining his pockets with defense dollars
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or by the words of brecht through mother courage if you cant make money during war you cant make money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those people are probably pretty close to any presidentelect
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did that moron really forget rule of acquisition war is good for business and they call themselves business men
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah its not like we hooked the government up to his personal bank account if youre in the business of selling bullets war is pretty good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats worse is that it takes an hour or two of source gathering writing and editing to conclusively refute idiocy spouted authoritatively in a post that took a minute to write any off the cuff youre a dumbass and heres the brief reason why shortcuts get down voted its not an efficient use of time i guess i could start compiling broad standard answers to frequent ignorant comments but honestly this stuff should have been covered in school with the goal of creating a well informed citizen capable of critical thought
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnadekhmwbxe trump putin is this news im hearing about you invading finland correct putin donald youre an american right trump absolutely putin you must have an enormous penis simply gigantic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no they just hate the left and will oppose anything they do or support thats been the only constant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,makes me feel bad for romney and mccain romney could have made his argument better but its tough against a sitting president mccain could have taken a harder line against trump but had his own election to worry about and must be getting tired of this shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well have a broken promiseoff lies to the left of us lies to the right of us volley and thunder
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or that theres a multitude of ways that china can sleight the states or just crack down on taiwan without it warranting an actual war
SubredditDrama,not_removed,chinas military modernization program hasnt gotten much coverage in the news and its not like its been going on for years oh wait yes it has
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because theyre ignorantracist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,clinton is a warhawk and will doom us all meanwhile at trump tower i think im gonna be the first president to openly encourage nuclear proliferation in this millennium
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trumps fawning servile admiration of putin this is what i dont understand from his base putin is an actual kgb agent werent the republicans the ones who for decades wanted to go to war with soviet russia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the quickest way to get a trump supporter to talk about clinton is to criticise trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,their excuse for not getting into princetonharvard i would have gotten in if it werent for affirmative action never mind the fact that at that kind of college its more that the person with the got in over the person with a or even two people with where one was really good at math and they already had or students who are in the top in the country
SubredditDrama,not_removed,arent those the kind of countries where trump buys his wives
SubredditDrama,not_removed,someone who has never left there home state and is wilfully ignorant about any country outside of their hemisphere
SubredditDrama,not_removed,every country that isnt the us or the uk is a shithole for some people and some times not even the uk qualifies because theyve literally got sharia law in birmingham s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at least eesti has going for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well latvia has issues with potatoes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id actually argue that keeping the saudis happy is far more important they could trigger a worldwide recession for shits and giggles
SubredditDrama,not_removed,estonia isnt rightwing its just anticommunist which in this part of the world means antisoviet nostalgist trotskyism anarchism leftcommunism etc is basically unknownunexistent in the former warsaw pact unlike in the westreddit i dont know as much about latvia other than the fact that theyre more socially conservative than estonia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how everything about his rhetoric and his actions are textbook fascist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you cant say im calling my shot without actually calling your shot if you want people to applaud your bravery you at least have to roll out your counterjerk and take your downvotes like a man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,back to what i honestly want to know what your hopes are for this country and how you think trump is going to accomplish them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you do understand that trump has stacked his cabinet with war hawks and has said out loud he wants american boots on the ground to fight isis right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you dropped this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its been a thing for a year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and its double plus good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,minipeace
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all i want from trump is to deal with those pesky early game barbarians
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as usual everyone needs to step back and watch an episode of the west wing in this case a proportional response
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not sure if rpoliticaldiscussion was always so full of people who had very little nuance and it became more apparent when the board is now much less about polling or that it became flooded with them regardless theres been a few israel related threads and they are chock full of people who clearly have absolutely no knowledge about the conflict outside of america traditionally supporting israel and that some palestinians have and continue to resort to terrorism and lone wolf attacks the best example of this was when i told someone that their potential way forward in the conflict would start a real third intifada along with the heavy casualties and damage to israelis and palestinians the response was that a few thousand people dying in total wasnt that many casualties which of course not only avoids that the whole point was that we were talking about a path forward to a resolution of the conflict or that his pitch would lead to true apartheid but also that his number was only the deaths rather than people who were injured detained discriminated against harmed economically or terrorized during the previous intifadas its really sad that people can view the world in such black and white terms and then pat themselves on the back as if they know what they are talking about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,queue the bernie sanders supporters who still sit and stew in their smug pride knowing they kept hillary from winning even if it meant trump is president all because hurr durr the dnc cheated bernie so fuck everyone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think a big component is that they havent yet realized that this isnt the movies i remember when i was younger i thought everything was a much bigger deal than it is because thats how stories work right theres a thing on the news and then you cut to a few years later its a big dramatic setup and then theres a big set piece and you win as you get older you realize it doesnt necessarily work that way a lot of these kids are trying to be the guy that says wait you mean to tell me this means war in the trailer every time anything happens because theyre bored
SubredditDrama,not_removed,second only to prostitution as the oldest profession
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the roman republic served as the inspiration for the american republic and now the demise of the roman republic will inspire the demise of the american republic starring sanders as modern day gracchus and trump as marius edit i am fully aware of how cringeworthy this is it is intentional
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt war get everybody out of the great depression
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this should be a meme at this point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,instructions unclear made a war porn business
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly this it is not that he is a warmonger it is that he is an idiot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah toxic masculinity the only right reason to start a war if youre an ignorant fascist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,overreacted to a provocation like a donald trump rooster statue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we have no reason to think that trump has either the inclination or the stomach to start a war for profit yeah he doesnt really have his fingers in those pies either if trump nukes any country itll be because he heard they had a tv show that made fun of him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump is one man the corporate elites and policy makers that do most of the work in washington have more influence than he does theyll happily push for invasions and push him to be less outspoken
SubredditDrama,not_removed,itd still be a waste of time most people arent going toosten to someone they vehemently disagree with no matter how well that someone supports themselves human bias is a hell of a drug
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats worse is that it takes an hour or two of source gathering writing and editing to conclusively refute idiocy spouted authoritatively in a post that took a minute to write if that worked it wouldnt be a waste of time problem is that it doesnt the response you get is an attack on your sources biased or a flatout refusal to read all that a lot of people dont want their believes challenged and they dont like being corrected either and on top of that it is work to read through a bunch of articles about foreign policy people who do that are usually not the ones leaving ignorant comments i dont think it would help to teach anything specific in school either you need to be genuinely interested in politics to follow it regularly and you need to follow it regularly to be able to put things in perspective the claim that obama is risking wwiii by expelling some russian diplomats and spies is laughable to anyone who reads a newspaper regularly it happens all the time unfortunately i dont know what actually would help either theres a german saying that roughly translates to you can lead a cow to water but you cant make it drink the will to become better informed has to be there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the conclusion being arguing with fascists on reddit also twittermost social media is pointless because the unfiltered system tech libertarianism has set up inherently favors intellectual dishonesty in service of cult recruiting instead of actual positive engagement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if the us went to war with china the entire world would lose i dont think you understand how powerful china is they not only have the worlds economy by the balls they have nukes too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,china or russia could go for mad if they wanted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not when both countries have nukes ignoring that that attitude hasnt really served the us well in the past has it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well obviously mr trump is only saying that to psych out americas enemies he would never do that because he is a deeply honest man who would never go back on his word to us his voters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,republicans want to be in power more than anything trump will let the republican establishment do what they want for years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but now hawkish republicans have a new enemy muslims all of them and there are far more muslims and islamic countries than there are russians and they work better than the red scare because they wear funny clothes especially the women so you can spot them more easily when they try to assimilate infiltrate your culture
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trumps base and republicans arent necessarily the same people the base the ones who affirmatively want him to be president by and large dont have an ideology that leads them to a specific position on russia they are just in the thrall of a personality cult he shouts the words they repeat them as for republicans lesson from this election most republicans never really were all that attached to the orthodoxy on any number of issues but its also true that this is the one area where you see a semblance of leadership from the party and principled resistance to his stupidity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the right hated russia years ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,turns out its not soviet russia anymore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a few hundred miles off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its also partially the inspiration for ankhmorpork in the discworld series this makes it excellent in my eyes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love tallinn one of the best cities ive ever visited
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but where do i park my car there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i understand the internet there is also preposterously fast
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh the saudis have fiscal constraints they cant really afford to do anything that would reduce their revenues and they have far less influence over worldwide production levels than they used towould like to have
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh you mean like flooding the market with crude oil to fuck over opec producers in and as a consequence causing the unemployment rate in calgary and across alberta to rise to about shakes fist unfortunately weve been dealing with the fallout of this for several years now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they learned that triggering recessions was bad for their own bottom line back on the
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trotskyism anarchism leftcommunism etc is basically unknownunexistent lets be honest outside of college dormitories zines printed on recycled paper and very illtempered reddit users theyre basically nonexistent in the west too there are democratic socialists and thats as far to the left as any institution goes in the west
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think everyone knows what they mean and its super funny unless youre part of the srd jerk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im wondering what the counterjerk would be in this situation just a link to td edit alright i have absolutely no idea why this is so heavily downvoted apparently theres a hidden meaning to this post which escapes me heres the joke people the counterjerk would be trump is great and so you might as well just link to td
SubredditDrama,not_removed,take it back from the liberals its certainly not having any other effect
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honest question when people say boots do they mean soldiers or soldiers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yo brother no personal attacks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he is a psychic god all glory to ubarttbeast
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trumps whole schtick is basically duckspeak anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the west wing should be required before you turn so that you know what you are going into when you go to the booths
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly rpoliticaldiscussion has been super mediocre for ages i still read it but theres barely any new posts and theres a very large trump presence there especially among newer posts its pretty depressing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im still convinced that of the i supported bernie and now im voting trump posters were just trump supporters all along trying to manipulate lowinformation liberals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see more mentions of this than i do actual people doing this i now its anecdotal but blaming them for hilarys loss is pretty silly i would bet a large majority that most sanders supporters still voted hilary i know i did and everyone i know did as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where does the bernie supporters cost hillary the election narrative come from besides the insane conspiracy fueled bernie subs that are still active on reddit i promise im not a rabid internet troll trying to bait you into an unwinnable argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry we only have this participation trophy that has been certified by the helicopter parent association of america
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought flint knapper was the oldest profession
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dog this isnt even accurate you should be pointing to trump as crassus not gracchus gracchus would have been someone like eugene v debs or mlk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump is marcus livius drusus the younger promises change to the people that is unrealistic to get them to not vote for the actual reformers then the changes never happen because of course they dont trump isnt the death of democracy just the beginning of the beginning of the death there are still many many changes that need to occur before it can die id be cool with a resurrected julius caesar becoming emperor though sure he may have genocided the gauls but his frilly toga and promiscuity are something i can relate to as a hip millennial
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lets get cyclical
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while the marian reforms did indirectly lead to the fall of the republic i dont think i would compare him to trump because marius wasnt a monumentally incompetent idiot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know you are joking but this is the kind of thing that just somehow slips from the national consciousness after a decade and memes seem to be the only concise form of communication right now followed shortly by fox bylines
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont stop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,activision is that you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,technically its ferengi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,peace is also good for business
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rule is httpmemoryalphawikiacomwikirulesofacquisition which given trumps cabinet appointments and their monetary contributions to his campaign is also very relevant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hillarys emails are you fucking seriously suggesting that trumps heart isnt just pounding at the thought of taiwans government not enjoying universal formal recognition and that its not an issue which deeply affects him to his very core taiwanese recognition was practically what he campaigned on for trumps sake hillarys emails he is a beautiful and thin man who has nothing but righteousness in his heart you cretin he will not rest until the plague of taiwans government not enjoying universal formal recognition is rectified for the glory of all humanity its time regressive leftists like you caught with the times
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well it is still less than the odds that a female leader start a war because she was hormonal that day fucking s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a much bigger cock then him we can all agree on that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only reason rockefeller isnt going to be a smoking crater in january is because of its proximity to trumps solidgold apartment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most people arent going toosten certainly not i for one have never toostened
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no but the other thirty people who see it will be
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres a german saying that roughly translates to you can lead a cow to water but you cant make it drink theres an english idiom that says you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink two languages united by a nearlyidentical idiom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly he says things he doesnt mean but he always means what he says
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah tbh i think trump is just a national embarrassment while republicans running unchecked will cause actual problems with the budget education healthcare and whatnot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the right hated russia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wishing to wage war with another nuclear power that is a weirdly disingenuous way to describe anyones position on the soviet union even at the height of the cold war
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess they would be baltic states not eastern europe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this i did not know now i have the urge to take the next flight out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in a quaint alley
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats nice to know im not super well versed in geopolitics i did have the impression that a lot more countries have discovered a lot more oil since those days isnt it still top dog in opec though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have a lot of friends who went out west for work the second they finished grade they were devastated by that really unfortunate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are dozens of them dozens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,linking to trumps twitter is easier
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the counterjerk would be that trump isnt the end of the world the very far left metasubs will downvote the fuck out of you for saying that and it probably means youre a racist fascist trump supporter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,more specifically take it back from the scary black man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,confusing i know but boots in this context is treated like its singular like the sentence i bought boots means you bought one pair of boots boots means pairs of boots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh yeah that was a thing i did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the influx of trump posters is definitely an issue but the larger one is how unreasonable some of them are of course theres something to be said about it representing real world positions but its still really obnoxious to slog through unfounded andor super simplistic arguments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that and edgy kids that just wanted to piss mom off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive fairly certain that you are correct and the vast majority of sanders supporters switched to clinton however i am personal friends with some otherwise rational people who did sit out the vote and every time trump gets mentioned they basically respond with thats what the dnc gets for not supporting sanders it hurts my head
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it happens all the time in rpolitics or at least it did until a few weeks ago when i got banned for telling someone that conspiracy nuts like alex jones had no business having an influence on the white house havent been back since
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in several states the number of green party voters was more than the difference of trump clinton so if those green voters moves to clinton she would have won those states i dont know how clear of a line you can draw from disaffected sanders supporters to green party voters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the oldavui profession
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people only started flint knapping to make money to pay for the hoors
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i tried to find people for sanders and trump not the other way around either of the gracchis would be the closest fit for sanders because he tried to go into national politics through the power of the masses against the grain of the party establishment crassus would also be a fit for trump due to his wealth but he was born after both of the gracchi were dead marius fits imho because he was a pompous ass in love with himself and he also opened the floodgates for the total domination of the state by the super rich and fitting the topic hes also the guy who probably made the most money through warfare in the history of mankind without being a monarch
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how dare you besmirch the name of crassus by comparing him to trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id be cool with a resurrected julius caesar becoming emperor though sure he may have genocided the gauls but his frilly toga and promiscuity are something i can relate to as a hip millennial that man who wears his toga loosely belted perish the thought
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wanna get cyclical
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i meant likeits such a stupid argument thats what it should be relegated to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i meant likeits such a stupid argument thats what it should be relegated to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah rule i like your thinking
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also hillarys emails
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i dont even know how that happened my phone never toostens to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that reminds me of my old german textbook which gave the meaning of das ist spanisch zu mir as its greek to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah for both countries stop acting like the us whould be the clear winner a war like that whould be absolutley devastating for the whole world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this sentence works the other way round too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah this is the real issue dems have lost control of a significant number of state governments so this means redistricting under the red watch the house senate presidency and very shortly scotus its a problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude youre in the senate do something about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh youre into discworld i feared it might go over your head or smth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the distribution of proven reserves has definitely shifted over the past few decades venezuela now has larger proven reserves than saudi i believe saudi is again the number one producer and exporter though the production rankings have flipflopped a few times in recent years they are also the producer with the most spare capacity and the lowcost producer all of which means that saudi theoretically has tremendous influence over prices especially in the shortterm but they are hamstrung by rather generous domestic expenditures that are financed entirely by oil revenues reducing production for them is the same thing as cutting government spending and controlling supply is increasingly hard anyway because a its not just opec anymore the us and russia are the and producers and b everyone in opec cheats on quotas
SubredditDrama,not_removed,consider that sa is in the process of starting the biggest sovereign wealth fund to help deversify their economy so they understand the limits of oil are more realistic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and sometimes more coherent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean trump is a pile of garbage animated by some kind of dark garbomancy so im not sure why youd ever defend him unless you were a nazi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like a war based on racial purity could ever happen in europe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump got elected because we cant handle the bants checks oot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id say boots here is synecdoche using a part of something to refer to its whole like saying wheels to refer to a car
SubredditDrama,not_removed,weird thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he has responded all hail
SubredditDrama,not_removed,excellent precognition dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot of the new posts and a lot of the major threads on posts seem to be written by trump supporters to discourage leftleaning posters rather than to encourage actual discussion then theres people like clockofthelongnow who are basically just conservative robots who cant stray from the party line but of course its impossible to actually discuss any of the issues with rpoliticaldiscussion because meta discussions are blanket banned its just really frustrating because it has so much potential
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my fb feed is full of these people i dont even have many fb friends
SubredditDrama,not_removed,restaurant ran out of that chicken you like burn the fucker down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,marius actually had some real military talent though and got to his position mostly through merit rather than having daddy hand him everything he also solved some real problems the german invasion military being incapable of filling the ranks due to the land requirements rather than bullshit made up ones

SubredditDrama,not_removed,reneging on allies that for decades cooperated to keep russian imperialism at bay because he wants his company to profit is what he brings to the table not being less hawkish have you not been seeing the news lately on his comments about china
SubredditDrama,not_removed,except trump is hawkish just against a different set of people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hawkish i got bingo guys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the person you just responded to is different than the commenter you originally responded to you one of them kinda thick city trolls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,somehow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably because im not a college kid that thinks someone whom i disagree with being elected is some apocalyptic nightmare
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cant tell if s or not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,make north korea best again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god one thing that guy does when random democratic politicians are discussed is say that theyre against amendment rights and when pressed defines opposition to amendment rights as opposition to citizens united annoys me every time i see it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that for sure is an issue and i could probably easily identify a handful of the more active people who fit that description i could really do without the low investment posters on the right and the left
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now i want some fried chicken thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you think the problem with trump is he disagrees with me you either havent heard anything about him or you support him so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sure that a lot of the issues of the sub could be addressed if there was some way to discuss its issues as a group but i think the no meta posts rule is slowly killing the quality of the sub a lot of the posters are really just straight up bad though

SubredditDrama,not_removed,what do you mean by a feminist response a feminist response a modest proposal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rindia is really starting to give us drama these last few days or so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am not at all shocked to see a misogynist here too true i really wish i didnt just expect it any time i learnt the users of anything were indian edit for context im indian and ive spent of my life in india indian men are the men ive interacted the most with in my life and there are a whole lot of them while i have a lot of great guy friends in my life quite a few of whom are feminists and social activists enough of them my family and people everywhere in my country hold sufficiently regressive views that i treat anyone who doesnt come with references with suspicion im not excusing my behaviour just explaining it this is why my previous comment says i wish i didnt because i hate that every time i meet someone from india a tiny part of me is just waiting for them to say their first misogynistic antifeminist thing this is just me holding people from my country and often only from my religion andor background to higher standards than i do those from elsewhere plenty of guys on reddit do find my views offensive and infuriating enough to tell me im a racist cunt for viewing indian guys with suspicion and i dont really argue with them because whats the point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rindia truly has the spiciest drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how in the hell is buying your parents plane tickets to foreign countries and not telling your wife how much you spent on them acceptable and not a glaring red flag foreign plane tickets usually cost over for one person for two people thats about a months worth of paychecks on the us median household income at the very least tell your spouse how much you spent because they need to know when it comes to that much of a hit to the finances
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i look forward to running into that op on rjustnomil
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im curious do indian redditors sound like regular ones
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i seriously hope thats a troll post it seems a little too on the nose to be real considering it hits every antifeminist talking point in a sense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,remindme not to visit rindia ever again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,holy shit what a feminist tldr
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly ive tried to dabble around in rindia being indian myself and its just the most toxic bullshit community everyones a prissy prick with a stick up their ass its an oddly conservative community too on many issues but not in an intelligent way nothing pisses me off more than when indian men use western rhetoric to talk about feminism in india i wish there was a place where south asian people could just discuss shit without all the rindia drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we need to stop outsourcing our drama to rindia build the popcorn wall s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rindiathe popcorn machine that keeps giving
SubredditDrama,not_removed,especially when they come to srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are we the same person no but seriously the other day someone asked me why i was such a manhater in response to a mild observation on how indian boys treat indian women i was furious i hate when anything that even remotely criticizes men is equated to mouth foaming feminism in that country i hate when indian men use western rhetoric to talk about why feminism is not needed as if womens right in india are at par with the west i hate when my own mother spouts ignorant garbage about feminism because she was brought up to be submissive to men its a toxic culture for women i was hoping it would change but i havent seen any real progress in the last decade or so ill probably never go back to living in india full time because of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,have you seen indian mra stuff shits terrifying all the entitlement and anger at feminism of western mras with pretty much zero feminism actually present in the culture so they end up railing against stuff like women wanting the right to not be beaten by their husbands while still somehow making themselves out to be the victims
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how do you feel about the cultural norms ive met some very well educated and seemingly independent women who were okay with an arranged marriage that struck me as really weird but i just an american with only passing knowledge of indian norms the women didnt outwardly seem too upset about an arranged marriage and neither seemed like it was going to slow them down as far as their careers so how would you draw the line around stuff like arranged marriage it struck me as something that could easily be oppressive for women and i guess maybe for men in some cases but wasnt a big deal to the few women ive talked to about it i guess what im asking is arranged marriage or other such tradition inherently oppressive and part of the misogynistic problem or is it just an acceptable cultural norm now i feel like this is a dumb question just looking for your perspective on it since you seem to be someone who has spent much more time around it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cheer up its mostly trolls pretending to be indian only the misogyny is real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its lovely how youre promoting feminism by being racist edit srd continues to be a joke if it was a comment against the blacks or mexicans youd be outraged but because its against an asian subset youre all okay with it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im just here for the garam masala
SubredditDrama,not_removed,indians are super attached to parents regardless of how old you are very rarely are things questioned like this situation but you can bet if the person buying tickets for their parents was the wife the comments youd see would be more similar to what you said with an additional side of fat lazy gold digger wife comments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whats a regular redditor indian redditors use reddit and are therefore regular surely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now the indian drama in thing is shape shifting snakes the writers took inspiration from the i am snek memes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how is it redpill logic redpill is entirely against those things its the complete opposite of redpill like a redpill for women
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean its way at the bottom buried under a mass of downvotes i dont really think its representative of rindia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now this is the kind of feminism sargon of akkad can get into
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rindiaforcoolindiansonly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,disengage and dive in that is what i do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how do you get more than two indians in the same place without starting drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,years back it used to be a glorious sub with the best shitposters and trolls who were actually funny rip lolguard
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its complicated because at the same time i dont really like hearing ignorant comments about how terrible india is from someone who hasnt lived there or who isnt some sort of brown so the line to walk is very fine i love so many aspects of my country but there are systemic issues tied to power and history that arent going to go away on their own its really really hard for indian guys who arent already woke to understand privilege for some reason and for many women to understand that feminism isnt about hating men i had a tell me she wasnt a feminist because she didnt want special treatment because she was a girl i know a lot of really cool lawyers journalists and activists who constantly inspire me but the average stem group is invariably a horror show notallstembros
SubredditDrama,not_removed,explaining real question would you advise single female visitors to go or is it better to have a man traveling with you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes ive even met a few meeting guys like that after youve been to the manosphere enough times to recognize the rhetoric makes everything worse theres no talking to them i was enumerating all the ways in which life in india can be really awful for women to one of these gentlemen and his response was has any of that ever happened to you meanwhile his idea of men being oppressed while women had it easy was that as a single dude he had a hard time finding landlords who would rent to him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so they end up railing against stuff like women wanting the right to not be beaten by their husbands while still somehow making themselves out to be the victims seems like the sort of guys who fall into that always seem to be marginal men folks who are medlow on the socialeconomic ladder who are afraid if society progresses theyll get even more left behind the mirror inverse are the women who are also low on the socialeconomic ladder represent the tumblr feminists who think social progress means their status might shift up a bit western ones i mean
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the arranged marriage scenario in the types of social situations you describe are more about the parents shortlisting a bunch of dudes and the woman talks to them for a whilelike dating for a while before deciding to go ahead with it not quite the parents springing the guy on the girl a week before the wedding is it shitty yeah but could be worse the shortlisting process can be super fucked up depending on the parents you have your usual job family etc being looked at but the worst factor is caste even ultra progressive totally not cateist people turn into were only looking at our own caste because theres higher chance of them getting along due to similar upbringings eye roll bonus eye roll if these are the people who trash on affirmative action because so called lower caste people are stealing our college seats despite being brought up exactly like us then theres the family indian marriages involve the husband wife and the entire goddamn family from both sides so you better hope they get along ive met some uhinteresting people during the process
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im okay with an arranged marriage and for a while before i ever dated anyone i participated in the whole process it literally is just a blind date type of situation in most progressive homes ymmv of course and its up to the two people to figure out if its going to work or not when i was younger and just out of college i went on a whole bunch of dates with guys and either i liked them but they were turned off by my lack of femininity or my personality or i thought they were really dull and they thought i was fascinating or any number of other things a bunch of my friends and i used to have a matrimoaning google group that we wrote our stories to of my six married cousins four couples had arranged marriages and two had what we call love marriages and in all cases what was important was compatibility and family something thats mildly creepy about arranged marriages is how casteist it is and how much like a meat market it can be traditionally the arrangements were made through friends and extended family who knew the young people involved and felt that the families would get along one of my aunts used to say that when indians get married you dont just marry your spouse you marry their whole family and i think that is still true in many ways that also means a bunch of prejudices are baked into the system of course im hecka privileged because i come from a middle class educated family and i had an excellent education and neither my sister nor i were ever told we couldnt do or be anything we wanted in life apart from the moralphysical policing all girls get my cohort in school was from similar backgrounds and most of them did marry a lot later than the average and theyre all women with careers it depends a lot on your family and circumstances if you arent brought up to value yourself then you wont if youre poor andor uneducated then your options shrink dramatically and it takes far more courage to go against what is prescribed for you i have met many women like that and they are all inspirational i could write reams more but i feel like it would be inappropriate in this place you can pm me if you like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the women didnt outwardly seem too upset about an arranged marriage and neither seemed like it was going to slow them down as far as their careers you hear a lot about how the children are forced into these marriages instead of being able to marry the ones they truly love and so it seems shitty and oppressive but a lot of times the parents are pretty close to their children usually know them quite well and look for partners that they think their children will actually like as an example my parents married through this manner my grandparents found each other through mutual friends and met then after determining that the families had compatible values they introduced my parents to each other my parents dated for a little while and then decided to get married in all honesty it was my mom who decided my dad kinda just went with it the goal isnt to keep people away from finding true love its more to help the process along for marriageminded children if my mother had decided she really loved another guy my grandparents would have been ok with it this actually happened with my both my aunt and uncle who chose their own partners my mom just liked the process because she trusted her parents to do the vetting and honestly marriage through love is pretty hit and miss if you think about it speaking from a western perspective when you first get with someone youre really not thinking about how it may work long term and often times the people you hook up with are fun short term but would not be compatible long term at all but it can sometimes be hard to realize that in the middle of a relationship semiarranged marriages for all their quirks try and take a long term perspective toward marriage and they can often be pretty good because of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh how do you know i dont really spend much time on any indian sub except the one for my city
SubredditDrama,not_removed,context im indian and ive spent of my life in india indian men are the men ive interacted the most with in my life and there are a whole lot of them while i have a lot of great guy friends in my life quite a few of whom are feminists and social activists enough of them my family and people everywhere in my country hold sufficiently regressive views that i treat anyone who doesnt come with references with suspicion im not excusing my behaviour just explaining it this is why my previous comment says i wish i didnt because i hate that every time i meet someone from india a tiny part of me is just waiting for them to say their first misogynistic antifeminist thing i dont really think this counts as racism theres probably a different better word for it because i find i dont treat people from any of our neighbouring countries the same way this is just me holding people from my country and often only from my religion andor background to higher standards than i do those from elsewhere
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she is commenting on her own community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,parents too arent exploitative of their kids then if they are okay hawking his money for vacation trips it doesnt look good on them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because unless the family makes ridiculous amounts of money a year theres no way that the purchase wont affect her round trip ticket to a foreign country is about per person thats for his parents on the average us median household income thats almost an entire months pay thats the difference between paying the rent or not oh im sure she can look it up but no one in a family should be making a unilateral decision like that and then refusing to discuss it for a purchase that large its an honesty issue for one nontransparency in finances is an enormous red flag i mean i could understand not caring about spent on a game but this is a large expensive purchase that most people cant afford and that can heavily bite both partners a lot of times you see when a couple runs into financial trouble it starts with one partner refusing to discuss finances secretly running up enormous amounts of debt and then blindsighting the other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,last time i checked indian redditors were only outnumbered by americans and brits round here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,indian drama in thing is shape shifting snakes i had to google that immediately is it naagin should i watch it edit oh my god the plot summary on wikipedia sounds insanely wild fantasy soap opera the best kind
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til they have indian soap operas about taylor swift
SubredditDrama,not_removed,redpill uses manipulative techniques like withholding affection and sex in order to make the woman more obedient they just flipped the gender but the core idea is still the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well the type of shit in the linked thread is what trp warns that every woman will do given the opportunity hence justifying the manipulative tactics they use that is their logic anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its complicated because at the same time i dont really like hearing ignorant comments about how terrible india is from someone who hasnt lived there or who isnt some sort of brown so the line to walk is very fine yes i think the line between legitimate criticism and stereotyping is very fine indeed in fact even hearing other brown people who have never been to the country or dont know much about its intricacies annoys me and comes off as ignorant more often than not theres a lot at play here i think the general population needs some easily accessible feminist education for us to go forward though i remember when deepika padhukone tried and was hit with all sorts of inane backlash one line of comments i remember fairly clearly was the if women can have sex with whoever they want then they shouldnt complain when their husbands cheat on them as if a single woman having sex is the same as infidelity it just shows a deeply entrenched double standard in society
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not op but i hope i can help i would personally not want to travel alone in many parts of india i have been to i would be ok with traveling alone in the major southern cities quite safe relatively speaking and some resorttype places although getting to those places alone would not be ideal even having other female companions would be better than traveling alone it also partially depends on what you look like tbh since i am of indian origin and its obvious that i have grown up outside of india based on my style and mannerisms i am treated differently than women who are from india or women who do not look ethnically indian for example i wouldnt want to travel alone with a male companion in some regions if we were unmarried because it would be frowned upon in those areas but it wouldnt be a big deal for nonindians i also tell people im there to visit family even if im not which is believable given my looks so at least they know that a bunch of people are looking out for me and it wouldnt go unnoticed if something happened to me its also dependent on your tolerance for various thingsi dont consider staring or wolfwhistles harassment because i dont find them threatening for example but some women do and that influences their experiences of the country i also have to adapt my behavior a little when i go there and become as inconspicuous as possible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my sister does and has done a fair amount of traveling alone and she has her own set of defense mechanisms to keep people at bay if she needs to i used to be slightly more of an ingenue and have on occasion almost got myself into sticky situations by not paying attention it really depends on where you travel because there are lots and lots of places in india that are full of really lovely people language can be a barrier unless youre going to mid sized cities or larger it also im sorry to say does depends on what you look like how you dress and how you carry yourself
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anytime someone asks about marriage on that sub dae and dowry law abuse hell just google and the top result is stop the abuse of for anyone without context its like googling about rape and getting an mra screed about how women are falsely accusing the entire male population willy nilly as the top result
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it reminds me of that study of gamers where they found that it was the lessskilled players who were most toxic towards women joining the community i think the idea was that theyre the ones who had more to lose ie ladder position etc so they were more hateful and resistant to change than players who were more skilled
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im desi and a guy and went through a couple of arranged marriage first dates it really was parents just picking someone of the same socioeconomic and cultural background my family is muslim so no formal caste and going on a platonic date i ended up mostly dating japanese ladies that was my undergrad major and i lived there for several years and ended up meet a korean girl in the us told my parents i was going to propose and it didnt bother them theyre thrilled im getting married and like her when you hear arranged marriage you think two people are forced together or even child marriage its not that that never happens especially maybe in some arab cultures or in poorer parts of india though thats still uncommon in this day and age not that we should sweep such situations under the rug its not even like it was for my parents my mom was when she got married they met on a monday and got married friday these days its for most middle class desis its more like a seinfeld situation where your parents network their friends to find someone your age to go out on a first date
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i meant it sarcastically ive seen a lot of trolls pretend to be part of a minority or ethnic group simply to say inflammatory things from the other side i didnt mean to insinuate misogyny from indian men isnt real it very much is and it is a problem
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive posted about this on srd before but some facts about me im a desi guy born and raised in the us i understand some of the cultural norms that are frankly misogynistic in desi cultures having seen them in friends or even growing up in my family nuclearextended b im a pretty avowed left wing feminist nutball and advocate for poc this leads to some tension for me your feelings are totally valid and your experiences describe a lot of desi guys especially many born and brought up in our countries if i were a woman i would strongly prefer not to datemarrywhatever a guy like that in the same way as a man i doubt i would be compatible with a woman raised in that culture my mothers family is well known for being out spoken and feminist at least for their times and yet speaking with her i know that her culture and upbringing has limited her in some ways she recognizes and others she doesnt i wouldnt wish that on anyone i also see my father who must seem a little like archie bunker in though hes more progressive than his parents and seems to grow a bit more every year i grew up in this country and can look outside my culture and understand there are things that i dont like or are incompatible with my values that said as a guy raised in the us im not like that and it sort of sucks that in some cases some people would paint me with the same brush because im of the same ethnic background as the men they have met that does seem like a stereotyping to me from your detailed comment i think you give people of the doubt and the subtext also seems to be abcds may get a pass form you unless they prove otherwise but i often experienced when i was dating or heard about south and east asian women who simply didnt date asians for similar reasons and thats fine not everyone has the right to date everyone though a blanket policy does seem a little close minded to me someone who has that policy probably wouldnt be interested in me for a lot of other reasons however i do think this attitude helps contribute to the culture or stereotype in the us men of asian men east south or southeast being sexless or nerdy or undateable i do feel like many of us are emasculated and stereotyped in this culture and while i completely understand where youre coming from i do think that attitude contributes to it i do think that culture hurts us i think it is related to the problems poc face in the west consider stereotypes about other ethnic and gender groups and part of me thinks it is hurtful coming from women poc i lived in japan for a while and dated there theres a lot of stuff there that is normal there but wed consider strongly misogyntic should japanese women put up with it i dont know and i know i got many dates and continued many relationships because i didnt act like most japanese men more ikumen than ikemen if you know that distinction i dont know the answer to that question but it did improve me and my relationships when i thought about it ive posted here because i think ops comment is valid and she has every right to discuss her experiences i also want to let her know that i understand and want to explain some of what i feel in this country by means of post script when ive posted about this before asian mras have used it as an excuse to dm me to join their cult let me make it clear mra philosophy tied to asian men or not makes me ill and if you dm me ill happily edit this comment to add your dm for public ridicule
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i understand the position youre in but there are plenty of ways to talk about reform being needed in a countrys culture without making it a race thing yes i understand youre indian as well but that doesnt mean youre immune from making racial comments like that i dont really think this counts as racism theres probably a different better word for it because i find i dont treat people from any of our neighbouring countries the same way im sorry to say but it doesnt work that way just focusing on indian and not doing this to nepalese or pakistani people doesnt eliminate the charge that it was a racist comment regardless of the race of the person saying it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes i called it udblackrabbit looksee
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and you can be racist while commenting on your own community holy shit this isnt rocket science
SubredditDrama,not_removed,o
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup naagin my sister watched one for funsies and snappchatted the whole thing its crazy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is taylor swift a shape shifting snake i knew her lizard eyes were hiding some secrets
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or do what i do cut all ties from your indian background oh easy for you to say youre an nri
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes really the worst worst thing is how many young women buy into the tired tumblr feminist stereotype because their upper class upper caste lives seem to be full of privilege god knows i didnt think or know much about my own caste privilege until really recently but now that i have i cant ignore it any more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when you have to start setting up fake contingent families im going to call that a no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you i appreciate the response
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think ive visited rindia a total of six times in my life and its been awful every time i have found the redditors in my home city pretty chill so that makes me rather proud and happy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,two stories that i know of personally wife and husband separate wife files a dowry case police come and take away everyone including the guys very old parents who can barely walk and his sister who doesnt even stay in the same village its two months before the old parents see the light of the day indian dude and his wife in us have differences dude files for a divorce in the us wife flies to india and files a dowry case against him now he cannot come home for fear of being arrested and will probably lose his job if that happens case is withdrawn after both parties and mediators get involved and they agree on the terms for divorce all the while the wife and her family has this leverage on the husband she is educated enough to know she will probably get a quicker judgement and probably a harsher one too if she files a case against her husband in the us but she flies all the way to india to file it why because in india she doesnt have to prove anything for her husband to be thrown into jail httpindianexpresscomarticleindiaindiaothersgovernmentplanstoamendantidowryharassmentlaw the second article has this to say about the law according to the provisional data of the national crime records bureau ncrb a total number of and cases have been registered under the protection of women against domestic violence act in and out of to one lakh cases investigated every year nearly complaints of dowry harassment turn out to be false the figure makes the protection of women against domestic violence act one of the most abused laws in the country if a law is so abused that turn out to be false cases and the law mandates compulsory jail for anyone accused of violating it i would be very concerned people asking for reform are not asking for a repeal of the law what they are asking for is relief from provisions that make jailprison mandatory even if you are just accused of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was about to write a post about how not all desi guys are like this and how awful it is that we are all painted with the same brush because of a few idiots and i see this dumb little post asian mra is the worst
SubredditDrama,not_removed,step back and cool off this kind of comment is unnecessary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that depends on what you mean by uncommon a recent study on the subject warning pdf
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you for this really thoughtful comment when i was a mod on rmenslib i tried really hard to include conversations about nonwestern men because i think the regressive and restrictive gender binaries at home harm men as well as women it was hard because at least on reddit indian guys either have no problems dating and so dont care or have a lot of problems and go full trp i really do understand the narratives around dating when it comes to asian men and women in predominantly white countries i just hate that i cant voice my own personal discontent without worrying that some racist person is going to take that as carte blanche to call indian men smelly hairy virgin rapists or whatever quite frankly the shit indian mras and trpers spew is exactly the same shit that mras and trpers of every other hue spew i just extra hate it personally because india is still awful for women compared to other places the manosphere is active to racists i say clean your own house ive said things about indian society before off and on the problem is that indian society is only going to change if those with privilege work to change it and they really dont want to ive had north indian men message me to tell me im probably fat dark and hairy because im south indian and id never attract fair and handsome men like them ive had guys call me a race traitor because ive dated white guys ive had many antifeminist indian men tell me im a stupid bitch cunt slut for thinking feminism isnt evil and pretending to care about mens issues i have also had some people message me to ask for advice and that is always edifying i dont avoid indian men you know i just dont act excessively friendly towards them unless i meet them in what i consider safe environments like in class or through friendsfamily or at sjwfeminist events as my very first comment stated all i am saying is that im never surprised by misogyny from a strange indian man and often indian woman were very good about internalizing that misogyny online i dont expect it every time but when it does happen im never surprised disappointed but resigned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thank you for saying this as a feminist brown dude its just disheartening getting stereotyped by people who should know better and having srd of all places cheering them on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,racism is prejudice power thats structural racism not standard racism for example it is actually possible to be racist against white people in america but it doesnt contribute to any kind of notable systemic disadvantage for white people in society
SubredditDrama,not_removed,goddamn i love meeting indian feminists in the wild
SubredditDrama,not_removed,plenty of black women often comment on terrible misogynoirist attitudes within the black community you and i dont have a right to say those things as outsiders and we certainly should not call it racism i have a right to feel miserable at the misogyny in my community despite your condescension
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im determined to find it and watch it but while looking around i got distracted by the movie krrish and that looked so fun i need to do that one first
SubredditDrama,not_removed,🐍🐍🐍
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt it basically what the whole dread game thing is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he doesnt rtheredpill does
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol its not necessary at all i just say it when people ask me personal questions i mean i even do it here in the us too doesnt mean id dissaude people from visiting this country
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i lay off it for a long time and inevitably when i visit theyve got some woman bashing disguised as an askreddit question up there my absolute favourite ones so far on womens day there was a thread titled happy womens day india how have you seen women take advantage of their gender saltier than the dead sea sometime this week whats the worst example of double standards youve seen cue virginity and slut shaming in the guise of emotional baggage which only ever affects women i know some people who were active on the sub a couple of years ago and theyre absolutely lovely unfortunately the forever alone and angry political discussions took over more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah its even worse when you spend a bunch of time in this thread basically begging people not to stereotype desi dudes as misogynists smdh lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,srd is literally upvoting a woman who says she views brown men with suspicion unless they come with references what a joke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a bit convenient for the nonwhite oppressor in question is that supposed to be me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres an indianfeminism sub though its regularly brigaded by shitstirrers and bakchodi
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can feel whatever the hell you like to feel my issue is that srders are okay with people like you making racial comments about asians while your same exact comments would be condemned if it was said about black
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hahahahaha i only laugh because i feel like crying one of my friends writes a lot of feminist posts on facebook and the amount of bullshit she gets any time she dares to question the status quo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you should see todays post about hoaxes youve fallen for
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i lost a cousin to terrorism in my parents native country a few months ago so you know what i think our culture needs plenty of work like every culture im proud that im more understanding and progressive than my father or my fathers father and to his credit my father is proud of that too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the top comment says all indian men are misogynists and so it is ok to dehumanize them i seem to have missed that commentare you talking about the one you responded to you can report anything that breaks the rules your comment was reported probably because that was an unbelievably rude thing to say so focus on making your point without saying stuff like that and if you see someone being similarly rude you can report them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i can acknowledge that indian culture is misogynistic as fuck ive experienced it first hand in both india and here in america i just disagree strongly with stereotyping everyone born in the culture its kinda fucked up to go around telling people to be ultrawary of desi dudes like were unable to be individuals who can reject the misogynistic aspect of the culture
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dial it back youve been warned before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she did not say anything about their brownness shes talking about her own culture its like if i talked about how often i encounter misogyny among americans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im pretty sure a lot of people know the ftp is indian it pretty common knowledge
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not about caring about standard racism which to be honest you still should because otherwise youre just a hypocritical fuck its about making a coherent argument that doesnt make people roll their eyes at your fucking stupidity if racism is prejudice power is an indian dude or lady in the us that refuses to let his son or daughter marry a black man or woman not actually racist because he or she doesnt have power in the us just prejudice no thats fucking stupid and not how racism works and you sound like a fucking idiot this may shock you but there are more races out there than white and nonwhite ive known punjabi girls and guys that say fuck pathans theyre all rapists in fact from what ive seen of different people from different parts of pakistan many different ethnicities have problems with people of other ethnicities is that racist or not apparently according to you its only racist if one of them has power which obviously youll arbitrarily define in whichever way you want my mom wouldnt want me to marry people of certain races from pakistan oh but she doesnt have institutional power shes not racist no ones white here it cant be racism would it be racist if a white guy or girl said fuck black men man theyre all rapists yes in that same vein not all brown people fall under the fucking desi umbrella were a diverse group of fucking people and number over one fucking billion so you sound like an absolute fucking moron and i recommend you get educated hey guys pakistan didnt commit genocide in bangladesh because were all desi and therefore pakistanis cant be racist if one of the agents in the game of oppression isnt white then it cant be racism dont you know edit this came off as rude and far too aggressive and im sorry about that but also fuck it im sick of people that think racism can be broken up into a fucking mathematical identity with two variables if youre above the age of and think racism is that simple grow the fuck up discrimination is complex its hard to fight its hard to understand and youre simplification was so gross and stupid i couldnt handle it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tell me again why anyone should care about it because hurting somebodys feelings isnt a nice thing to do even if somebody is more privelaged than you maybe im just crazy but im not big on hurting people while justifying its ok since im punching up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i didnt say anyone should
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ugh ugh but ill check it out ty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre very pointedly not making any comments about any other group apart from their own srd is fairly willing to let people talk critically of their own community whether its asians talking about asians or black people talking about black communities what the hell are you going on about i cant dig up specific examples right now but there have been comments like that before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but you dont need redpill to be motivated to get on shape or quit smoking sure you get a few good things but theyre the generic self help tips you get without the heaping mountain of toxic crap there is on trp thats like becoming a nazi because they have snazzy uniforms they are fixated on lifting in between liberal lashings of misogyny if it helped you self improve good for you but ill take my self improvement without a whole sub thats hell bent on dehumanizing half the planet you can pull yourself up without pulling down and being bitter about women im not making shallow generalisations used to be a regular on tbp for a few years and had to quit because the red pill stuff kept progressively ramping up into horrifying levels
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i loved fb drama lol too bad im not on there anymore i had a lot of people whod be derided as sjws on my feed who dealt with a lot of random angry people everytime they posted anything feminism related lewiss law and all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im going to regret this decision arent i
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can you point to anywhere that this happened telling people to be ultrawary of desi dudes like were unable to be individuals who can reject the misogynistic aspect of the culture and can you also point out where anyone said desi guys were incapable of being feministprogressive thank you im being snarky for effect im sure you see plenty of negative stereotypes and it cant be pleasant im sorry if my comments upset you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,americans arent a race or ethnicity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,being indian doesnt give ftp the right to make racial comments against indian men any more than id give you the right to make racial comments against black men
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bro physicsismymistriss is desi and does all those things hes spoke about his background a bunch in different contexts and its kinda very condescending of you to make the assumptions you made of him from the very little you read
SubredditDrama,not_removed,check it out though they do have a few more reliant contributors who push on despite the instantaneous downvotes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,makes comment person responds okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,soon as you click on it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you think your original and now deleted comment helped or hurt your position i explained how such stereotypes hurt me in another comment and did it without resorting to the very stereotype i was arguing against you cant say the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah fair enough i dont think anyone thinks that its just the initial assumption about me that that people have when they see my skin color or place of birth that rubs me the wrong way and i havent had lunch yet so im especially cranky right now lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not really what im trying to say like just because there are a lot of indian misogynists and i know there are a lot doesnt mean people should assume every indian is a misogynist thats just straight up bigotry the reverse would be me assuming every indian girl is submissive just because that is considered normal in desi culture thats gross
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but id be talking about them as a collective culture like she is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,indians arent either
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i talk about hoteps a lot i also do talk about the fact that there is still a pretty strong amount of homophobia in the black community
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what did she say about race
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its only racist if one of them has power which obviously youll arbitrarily define in whichever way you want game set match
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i think youre wrong and too stubborn to listen and people have explained the context far better than i have so why should i waste my time arguing about this instead we could talk about how srd likes when brown girls complain about brown boys but cant stand them complaining about nonindians who say namaste or chai tea ps if anyone writes to me about the chai tea i will ignore you and block you its what i did to everyone in that other thread no ragrets
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good on you for getting out of a toxic relationship no one should have to put up with that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,top comment from guy i have tagged as terrified of getting falsely accused of rape while sexting a married woman whining about marriage and being childfree well the second part will stay true with that attitude d
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you say i treat anyone who doesnt come with references with suspicion and i meet a black person a tiny part of me is just waiting for them to say their first homophobic thing because theres a difference between holding your community accountable and making racial comments for some reason srd is fine with racial comments made against indians
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right but would you be be cool with someone saying they automatically view black men as homophobes unless proven otherwise
SubredditDrama,not_removed,indian
SubredditDrama,not_removed,out of curiosity what do you think his answers are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isee im going to go standin another thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol not remotely surprised ive seen people whine about how it was unfair for male babies that this one doctor someplace discounts hospital fee for baby girls to tackle female foeticide
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsmyoutubecomwatchvabzmfcslty im super tempted to post this everytime but then i also dont want to deal with the triggered tumblrina xd jokes thatll blow up my inbox all the indian tumblrs i know are foodfashion and makeupxyz photographysassy bollywoodgifs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ahahahaha i love that i would also love to see the drama that will follow once you post it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im all for respecting our guests but they ought to be prepared for people to cite evidence and data that contradict their opinions and statements if they arent based in verifiable studies and who will verify that evidence and data its painfully clear to anyone on reddit who went to grad school in any particular field science history law economics sociology etc that most people dont really have the background to sort through the evidence in specialized areas there is just too much out there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im putting down fake internet dollars that the stormfront black crime statistics pasta is posted at least times ill double down if any of those reach tripledigit upvotes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all this race talk is just creating more of a divide i hate the idea that talking about racism is whats causing problems and not the racism itself i dont understand how anyone can even seriously think that without being totally ignorant of race relations ignoring something doesnt make it go away that being said the thread tomorrow will be a shitshow cant wait to see the inevitable higheffort postmegathread here in srd once that hits the frontpage itll be toast i imagine most of the panelists will be downvoted no matter what they say just like when science takes any social issue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im weirded out by the numerous people saying this better be a scientific and backed up ama now i dont think expecting evidence is wrong especially in rscience its just about the approach theyre not coming at this with oh itll be an interesting conversation im curious to see their experiences and data they come at this already ready to deny their number one priority ahead of everything else before even hearing what they have to say is debunking these people based on nothing more than the fact that they want to discuss racism in academia now maybe some are just regulars with iffy social skills who dont understand the implications there but so many people are saying it i know im seeing the same racists that are gonna be causing problems today
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait let me guess racism doesnt real unless you can prove it with science here are sociological perspectives on racism i said science sociology isnt science checkmate people who believe in racism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,social science discussion in rscience oh boy this gone be good there will be plenty of valuable discussion™
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actual scientists obviously theres a world outside the academy which can affect us and our work and some of the features of that world have profound moral and political consequences we should investigate fans of science psssshhht link to dawkins tweet about feminism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god the level of condescension in the comments of that thread is infuriating i find it frustrating that those people think issues with replication are limited to psychology and that social sciences arent reliable or useful because they arent soft sciences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the bigger question is will people on reddit be able to handle facts they dont agree with oh you sweet summer child at any rate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it says a huge amount about reddits current temperament that that post even needs to exist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ahahaha half of rscience doesnt even believe in social science or the concept of themselves having any biases this is gonna be an amazing shit show
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a black guy into science i have my popcorn at the ready for all of this buttery racism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ohh man a discussion on racism in a default thats just begging for salt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how many race realist does it take to brigade a thread before it gets shut down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tbh i think that this is a good way to go about discussing such a sensitive subject i have to give the mods credit for that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im glad they are raising this issue i would if never thought about it otherwise at least they got some of the drama out of the way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so i countedthey removed and restored and then removed and then restored and then removed and then restored and then removed and then restored and finally just removed dukbcaajs httpimgurcomavcfui is that some kind of record
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we cant forget about the youre no longer allowed to debate whether or not being transgender is a mental illness as if it had been definitively proven and calling it hate speech like literally by definition its a mental illness that was wild wew lad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you beat me to the post while i was trying to come up with a clever title
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh boy can already see how well this will go i think blacks are violent savages of low intelligence why are people so racist towards whites reverse racism is real edit i went through the first article which spoke about the need to counter gender imbalances in stem conferences women are to more likely to be hired with the same qualifications in stem fields how can we counter this discrimination and this shit got gilded why the fuck do i go on this horrible website
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if there is one sub that can handle this correctly its science im hoping for the best but still expecting a ton of racism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i saw it on the front page i knew i had to come here so much concern trollingits hilarious to hear some of them demand for evidence and data while injecting their own theories without evidence or datatypical strategy of the mras and the like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,has the thread been deleted its not showing up in rscience
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one of the commenters in the drama moderator of rdonsguard rnewyorktimes rbreitbart rmuhsoggyknee ropreshun what a scholar
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where is this thread im days late
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly the thing that bothers me is that rscience chose to talk about racism in science over the broader prejudice it makes too much sense that there would be favoritism in science and them just filtering it down to race seems more like clickbait but honestly thats just nitpicking what is fun however is that there is a post from rscience on subredditdrama thats about as rare as it gets
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is how i feel reading popscience books i know i am supposed to read critically but how the hell am i supposed to know whether or not what an author says about family structure in preargricultural humans is correct or not am i supposed to go read all the sources he cited i dont have time for that shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what is the overunder on mentions of the bell curve what about mentions of james watson that include a condescending explanation of who he is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a fools bet to bet against you id have better odds picking tails on a two headed coin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill bet against that it gets removed by the fantastic mods over there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what the hell is that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are mods in rscience they might be able to handle it if they get all hands on deck hopefully i wish them the best of luck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the same argument they used to use in the and about wave feminism oh women were happy being subservient before feminists told them that they should want more its pretty standard reactionary rhetoric that you see in a lot of social progressive movements
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people who dont want to talk about racism generally are uncomfortable with admiting their own views
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah if stop talking about racism it will go away thats how salk cured polio after all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in the minds of many white people racism isnt actually still a thing and ended in so the only way to perpetuate it is to talk about race color blindness is one of the many shitty ways to be racist out there but its entirely socially acceptable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the same as people who say race relations are worse now then they ever were thats not true these people were just ignorant of racial issues and are upset they arent allowed to wallow comfortably in their ignorance anymore
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the same with a lot of issues racism sexism homophobia you name it so many peoples reaction is to just ignore it and pretend it doesnt exist its as if they think that just because theyre not racistsexisthomophobic then that means that no one else is either and its not a problem which gives them reason to say shit like why is everyone talking about it all the time and shoving it in my face ugh its a nonissue guys
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seeing more than a few rkotakuinaction users in there right now that likely got there from one of the two threads they have on this id say the bword but im not pretending like admins actually care about that sort of thing edit and as of am est i see mod and guest comments were knocked below viewing threshold a few subs got in on the action
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its important to have a dialogue about racism but i dont see how a discussion like this is productive its just going to consist of people shouting past each other and getting angry huge open forums just arent conducive to productive discussion about sensitive topics and opportunities like the current one are hijacked by the loudest most agendadriven people which in this case probably means racists doubly true since it was announced which gives places like stormfront and pol a chance to organize and brigade
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i missed this is there a link to the ama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,voicing your personal opinion i believe youve just lost srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,weve had the large hadron collider for so many years now and it still hasnt discovered the racism molecule surely this proves that racism is not a thing that objectively exists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,too late edit or even if they are considering the fickle nature of academic articles especially as they relate to psychology and social justice this is a comment on people supporting the claim that theres racism in science to have evidence for their claims where they go on to explain in this edit that even if they do have evidence itll be that soft psychological evidence which we all know doesnt really count edit damn i should have kept reading i remember feinmen who cited pyschology and the social sciences as a cargo cult of science because of their poor standards for peerreview and repetition of studies well at least back then they had disagreements now its an echo chamber and completely political
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know given the lack of ideological diversity and how bad the replicability problem is the further you stray from hard sciences im not willing to grant a heck of a lot of credence to sociological interpretations of overtly political phenomena not far off at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know at least one mod in this fray is an anthropology grad student or postdoc and possibly one of the most patient people ive seen on reddit so theres some actual valuable discussion in store and i would love to see more people reading responses from users like her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,science isnt about data or facts science is about smoking weed and looking at the stars and being racist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,link to dawkins tweet about feminism which one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah but let me link these crime and education statistics that show that black people commit more crime and have lower iq on average now no more discussion on the subject my point has been proven stop talking about the effect of poverty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well if you come across someone making an argument that all black people are savages of low intelligence all you need is evidence of one black person of average or higher intelligence to show that they are incorrect you could just reply to those comments with obama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they hide behind text walls and innocently question the humanity and basic dignity of other human beings because their impotent rage wont allow them any introspection to see that the cause of their problems isnt black people its them they are the cause of everything wrong in their own life youre reading a hell of a lot into this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i never noticed how dorky that run was until now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup sometimes i feel dirty going to this siteespecially if i look at the comments section of a front page thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as a black guy in to alcohol im going to probably avoid that thread for the sake of my wallet i can only buy so much booze
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive always wondered as a black man in science how do you feel about this one thing progressive metaredditors do to make fun of people who follow neil degrasse tyson by sarcastically calling him black science man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,depend if its linked to td or not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive always said hed go on to do great things
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i tried to think of one too but just gave up go for broke and get that mountain of karma once the actual panel discussion starts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre an addict
SubredditDrama,not_removed,geez thats eight hours of keeping the thread from becoming a dumpster fire before they start answering good fucking luck rscience mods
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if i recall correctly thru didnt really handle feminism well hopefully they learned a thing or two
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly the thing that bothers me is that rscience chose to talk about racism in science over the broader prejudice it makes too much sense that there would be favoritism in science and them just filtering it down to race seems more like clickbait its probably for two reasons expanding it to prejudice in general will massively increase the subject area theyll need to discuss and answer questions on and they likely understand the data on racial bias better and dont want to speak outside of their knowledge base both i think are reasonable and dont require assumptions of clickbaitiness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyve talked about women in science before havent they
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyve been featured a few times before last big one i remember was the position of some female scientists in the header bar being controversial
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tackling both the racists and the kiatia crowd at the same time would be too much for any sub e
SubredditDrama,not_removed,make a post if you think its good drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,boy what a bag of hot garbage to sort through
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same here if it helps though i was taught in history class that everyone always has an agenda even researchers if you come at it understanding their agenda and then read against it with mild skepticism eg i dont quite believe you so prove it to me vs wrong it should help a lot then whenever you run into a claim under that mindset that doesnt seem quite right to you you can investigate that claim specifically rather than taking the entire work as fact or denying all the evidence blindly also helps if you take a statistical analysis course which i did in college but you can do for free at coursera if a claim in a study is overstated or a stretch their data or methods will set you straight and remember nothing is true it could be possibly true or probably true just not true until its verifiable by others so when in doubt check out whether the study has been replicated successfully or whether other academics in the authors field like history agreedisagree especially with the more dramatic claims the ones youd find in a popscience book academics dont hesitate to express their feelings about the findings so at the very least youd expose yourself to alternate and credible explanations for the phenomena youre reading about book reviews from places like the nytimes could also do a lot of the contextualizing for you worth mentioning all this should be available with a couple of clicks in google or google scholar so aside from the statistics class which is a considerable but imo worthwhile time investment if you just get in the habit of it it shouldnt take up any significant additional time out of your day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this has its own problems but i tend to research authors more than claims look to see if someone is heterodox or is quite accepted in the orthodox academic community generally speaking people who are well respected by their peers and work at a mainstream university dont suddenly turn around and publish a book which is basically also btw racial iq differences are genetic and heres why whereas if you find youtube interviews with actual academics and every time the books author is mentioned they say oh that person you know somethings fishy now the downside is that youre totally just trusting that academic consensus truth which it doesnt necessarily and hasnt always in the past but it saves you from people pretending to be credible scientists and i kinda figure if all the academics in a field i know nothing about are wrong anyway theres no shame in me also being wrong not like im gonna by the one to figure out the grave errors theyre all simultaneously making
SubredditDrama,not_removed,becoming an expert in my field has ruined my ability to read things like scientific american i really enjoyed it in high school but as my education progressed i noticed more and more when things it claimed were oversimplified overstated or just plain wrong then when id read about things i wasnt as knowledgeable in id have to wonder if that stuff has so many problems what kinds of problems does this have that i just dont see
SubredditDrama,not_removed,am i supposed to go read all the sources he cited unfortunately thats insufficient because its fairly easy to cherrypick legitimatelooking sources to back any old batshit claim scientific literature is laaaaaarge instead you have to read the entire literature in that field good luck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow way to just encourage the acceptance of ignorance due to laziness s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,crowdsourcing works fairly well i just look up reading recommendations on whichever ask subreddit and it works pretty well for example there are about similar thread in askhistory that gave me good information on guns germs steels relative unreliability and suggestion for why the west rules for now as a substitute
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how do people reference the bell curve it was based entirely on stats from white men if i remember correctly the only significant thing i can recall from it is that smarter people tend to do better at things which always struck me as a duh sort of conclusion how you define success how you define smarter the impact of socioeconomic status etc all added fuzzy edges to the general conclusion that intelligence correlated with success drawing other shit from that book seems stupid i read it nearly twenty years ago though maybe im totally misremembering stuff
SubredditDrama,not_removed,on the other hand the payoff is only so making the bet was just as foolish
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my god you werent kidding
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that post was essentially your parents sitting you down to talk with you about how important it is that youre on your best behavior during daddys important business dinner
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would be them i would drop automod onto the thread and filter everything then approve things manually one by one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a lot of mods
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its quite unfortunate too theres a plethora of comments asking about antiwhite racism and all that fun stuff ill be shocked if the thread doesnt get locked tomorrow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only because theyre afraid of the consequences a few decades ago they would not hesitate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,everyones uncomfortable admitting their biases everyone wants to believe that they treat everyone equally but the difference is that social progressives are willing to challenge that hope and work to change their behavior and make it a reality where reactionaries either dont care that they have these biases think theyre the way things should be or are unwilling to change the way they think about prejudice because theyre comfortable with how they act right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hitlers invading poland quick look the other way thatll stop em these people seem to think racism works the same way dinosaurs vision did in jurassic park
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and its the mainstream medias fault for reporting about it again—it was gone until they mentioned it reappearing in places like nigeria
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the irony is they are participating in calling people racists too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people who hate racists are still haters edited to add for those downvoting me i would challenge you to try to love your enemies as a way to transform the world here is a podcast explaining the concept httpswwwpodcastchartcompodcastsnprinvisibiliapodcastepisodesflipthescript
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have heard way too many people say that racism is over because obama got elected twice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people talk about mlk jr as if he died peacefully in his sleep of old age
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not a native speaker here what do you mean by color blindness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can you explain how color blindness is racist if you ignore whatever race they are and just treat them like everyone else how would that be racist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it depends on how you define race relations if youre looking at it in terms of how difficult it is to be a minority then yeah nothings changed but i do think social awareness of race is much greater now than its been in a long time — which is why so many people are suddenly aware of how bad race relations are — and sometimes that can manifest itself as conflict i think its a good thing though it may not be a pleasant conversation to have but its an important one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its great that theyve dropped all pretense of caring about ethics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well thats why theres a mod team of people so it doesnt get out of control
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so when can this be talked about as shitty as the option is what is the alternative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the higgs is really a xenon xenophobia atom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you laugh but one of molyneuxs major arguments is that groups dont exist only people and he doesnt seem to notice anything wrong with this statement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or even if they are considering the fickle nature of academic articles especially as they relate to psychology and social justice mfw i read this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its worth mentioning that feynman also said at the very end of his diatribe on psychology that he was likely wrong in the matter but that it was his opinion he was right in that early modern psychology wasnt the most rigorous field but because of his statements a lot of academic psychologists started looking at how they could be more rigorous they succeeded and psychology research today is much different than it was years ago people seem to forget that modern psychology is an extremely young field compared to hard sciences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wanted to respond to edit when i was in the thread earlier from rall just in case mods mistake me for a popcorn pisserlike last time but it would have taken a while to do properly but im sure youre interested in it for lulz you see the other sciences were never wrong in the past few centuries just incomplete psychology though it wasis wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no dae redditors circlebroke pls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those arent the people that contribute valuable discussion™
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who knows
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and if you mention a study that shows the number of black people below the poverty line theyll just equate that to mean black people are lazy and completely ignore the context of jim crow and other laws which made life hell for black people and gave them the unfair stigma of being lazy criminals and dumb which followed them to the north and was exacerbated by the conditions they were living in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the problem there is all racists happily switch to saying average or vast majority when confronted exceptions dont challenge their worldview much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,iirc viggo mortensen broke his foot kicking away an urukhai helmet a couple of scenes earlier which is why he runs so incredibly silly for the rest of the movie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,come to rmariners all we do is shitpost about a sorta good mlb team actually most of the baseball subreddits are surprisingly fun and welcoming
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id drink too but im on a stupid diet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would think given your name and flair that that might be a good idea regardless of your wallet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they can be as sarcastic as they want his credentials arent going to just turn into mist because of it personally im more of a michio kaku fanboy but thats just me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive only seen black science man used as a term of endearment or used in memes redditors universally love ndt with the exception of certain metareddit counterjerkers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at this point theyre probably planning their blitzkrieg on rscience at their discordsircwhichever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they are gonna be all over it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah true i dont know why im addicted to this godawful website but i am
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its kind of amazing that this is happening rscience has been basically apolitical since the beginning and now apparently it seems that theres a significant political stance being taken i dont understand what political stance has been taken theyre simply discussing racial bias in science and the evidence for it and made a note that theyll be deleting pseudoscientific racist and offtopic comments seems pretty apolitical to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how is it political though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,history is nice in that it is a field that acknowledges the truth that we are biased
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your comment made me miss being a history major and makes me want to hang out on rteslore again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,just do what i do and be skeptical of most claims made especially if they line up with how you think if you find that your reading material is making more and more insights that you immediately agree with its time to change sources for that subject if you can i live with a possibly unhealthy and a very overwhelming amount of skepticism it works for me but i do not recommend it for others
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look to see if someone is heterodox or is quite accepted in the orthodox academic community generally speaking people who are well respected by their peers and work at a mainstream university dont suddenly turn around and publish a book which is basically also btw racial iq differences are genetic and heres why your advice is good but unfortunately this specific case is where a lot of the problems came from herrnstein was an incredibly wellrespected scientist and still is for his actual scientific work but then he went and published the bell curve
SubredditDrama,not_removed,usually stuff like this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they actually have a good system for such a high traffic sub the vast majority only have comment privileges with the idea being that therell always be a few people around to mod comments and stop things turning things into a shitshow its usually pretty effective but tomorrow sounds like itll be something special so who knows if itll work there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not the we it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,please tim i know you really like the why game but can we just have a time out why sigh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just saw a comment asking if white privilege used by panelist was appropriate in a discussion about bias only morning and im already done
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is better served in circlebroke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nah they relied on movement you are thinking of douglass adams ravenous bugblatter beast of traal its the only animal in the universe so unintelligent that if you cant see it it assumes it cant see you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe just maybe they get hate for good reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what are the other options apathy love of racists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and homophobia is over because of the scotus ruling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,color blindness ie im not racist i dont even see colorrace
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because youre ignoring the biases that other people have toward such people in an example brought up below imagine being a juror in a hate crime the color blind person would basically see it as a random crime and also because you only have the luxury of doing so if youre white acting as though ignoring race is all it takes to fix the world is naive and racist in itself while you go around acting like theres no difference between people the law wont the trump voters wont and so on it also just ignores history and the fact that white people have had an advantage for so long that simply treating everyone as equal from now on isnt really enough to compromise which is why we need things like affirmative action and reparations and a look at the prison system
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont flamebait lady and please dont invalidate the lived experiences of people of color who despite what you might believe still experience racism on a daily basis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how well has the colorblind approach worked out for france lately
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is the most comically blatant lie ive seen in a while racism is overwhelmingly shown in stats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i should make a running list of all the people in kia that tell me were not about ethics in games journalism anymore theres been a few really amusing ones
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are a good deal of valid scientific studies that in a vacuum can be used to further a racist agenda though thats the basis of most stormfront copypastas hardcore white supremacists have really refined the art of arguing from a racist agenda in a veiled or what seems to be objectivefactual manner theres also the angle of well this is a science forum why are you discussing subjective things and not providing any evidence why should i believe you if you have no proof thats ripe for exploitation a science enthusiast forum with millions of users just isnt the place for discussions like this in fact its ripe for exploitation by white supremacists because most users dont know enough about research to critically examine stormfront copypastas and get dazzled by statistics and publications even without context
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it should be a discussion between people in science who understand the history of racism and race in science and understand how to discuss statistics including ones that dont favor certain racial groups in a wider sociological and historical context otherwise this kind of discussion is worthless because its just people with agendas shouting past each other about things they dont know anything about not everything is worth talking about in large groups of laymen and a lot of people dont have opinions worth giving even if they care a lot about the topic on hand because they dont have the information or skills to argue from anything but emotion and possibly things that they dont understand eg statistics on race and stem performance in short race in science and the history of the study of race are both topics that require a lot of background information and most people dont have this information and will just try to blindly insert their agenda into the discussion some topics arent productive for laymen to talk about and those discussion will just lead to more problems
SubredditDrama,not_removed,boson privilege
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah good old gabor fekete
SubredditDrama,not_removed,without an image ill never know what kind of face you were making was it excited like a child opening a present early on christmas morning or the face my grandpa made when trying to pass a kidney stone and fart at the same time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if they think those fields are fickle then they should read stuff in historical linguistics where half the time when we think we figure out something we hedge it with something that can be simplified to but idk theres no way to know for sure at least psychology and social justice doesnt require an actual time machine to be absolutely certain you learn real fast what the term educated guess actually means when youre trying to reconstruct an ancient root or word that predates writing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know why people think physicists are credible experts on nonphysics fields by default
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think thats fair regarding his point here he was writing about the field as it was in the to there have been big changes and psychology continues to have troubles see the replication crisis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,absolutely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean if you cant repeat a study then it is not a good study whether feynman says it or someone else it is still true i dont know if this is endemic in the field of sociology or not but if it is then that is a legitimate criticism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its worth mentioning that feynman also said at the very end of his diatribe on psychology that he was likely wrong in the matter but that it was his opinion thats fair its just a shame that he couldnt have saved us the headache and just skipped the speculation entirely he was right in that early modern psychology wasnt the most rigorous field but because of his statements a lot of academic psychologists started looking at how they could be more rigorous they succeeded and psychology research today is much different than it was years ago people seem to forget that modern psychology is an extremely young field compared to hard sciences eh i think years is being a little too conservative basically the methods that we use today were nailed down at least years ago and havent changed much in that time there are definitely younger areas within psychology that have been finding their feet in that time but the same basic approach was cemented long before that as for psychology being a young science i think people underestimate that as well its been a rigorous hard science for nearly years now with strict empirical methods being used well back into the early to the point that some results and mathematical laws that were discovered back then still hold mostly true today even after repeated tests and replications its definitely younger than the other sciences though so there are some weird criticisms of psychology that would apply equally well to physics or chemistry at a similar stage of their timeline but of course they dont count when applied to the hard sciences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that made my brain melt i hate the fact that psychologists decided to be the first to address the replication crisis in science now laymen everywhere think the replication crisis is comment on how bad psychology is at doing science
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think we can fit them in a basket
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bigots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i knew that was bound to happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dae snallygasters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,given that the doctrine related to study of racial differences done by the american anthro assoc is based on the unesco race question which was largely decided on ideological grounds i dont think anyone will be particularly surprised of the official stance that person takes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what an asshat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fuck dawkins his selfish gene theory sucks too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jim crow was one generation ago for me my father was born in and his high school in nc remained segregated until after he graduated im only im a millennial hate that term and im the first generation in my familys entire history who could go to school with white children and that was in the its so absurd when people say racism has no effect my own parents were literally forced into inferior education and employment opportunities because of their race and nothing else that would quite clearly have an effect on the next generation maybe even a few generations also those people both the oppressed and the oppressors are still alive in the form of baby boomers who are politicians law enforcement business owners etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when it comes to american history i think puts into perspective the sort of time period were talking about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gets more complex when you include world events that introduce new racial stereotypes when i was a kid the negative racial stereotypes for arabs were very different and far less severe than they are now so by next year you could have a whole bunch of new low level racial prejudices you dont realise you have then theres the fact that isolated community cultures actually can make big differences so add a layer of anecdote and this is a battle well never fully win but need to fight aint nobody that doesnt see race compare stats between the uks indian and pakistani communities and the social mobility and crime statistics are night and day different details are unimportant for this post the example is interesting because the average person cant tell the difference so external racism almost certainly isnt the cause
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that sounds incredibly painful
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the secret is drinking straight hard liquor taking a multivitamin lots of jogging and really watching what you eat im on good terms with booze and im in good shape
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the meta redditors that call him black science man as far as ive seen i could be wrong though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,like other addicts you havent chosen to quit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well its definitely a mark of social progress that a bunch of scientists and enthusiasts are discussing something as important as racism as someone who belongs to a racial minority group it makes me feel slightly hopeful ignoring racial bias doesnt make it disappear it needs to be discussed even if it makes some people uncomfortable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can add those juicy comments in a comment easily then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not lazy i dont care about racists crying about censorship post it yourself stop being lazy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,indeed it is it is quite common knowledge that a lot of the time we only have one side of the story especially the further back you go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah damn i suppose i should have added
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so i dont even want to go look at those maybe later when i can scream at my computer screen without drawing as much attention
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope they have triple staff on duty since even the announcement comments are turning to shit heck theyre starting to bring in other forms of ism too including transphobia and the like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ya the vast majority are subject matter experts with comment only basically to remove incorrect info the requirements to be that kind of mod there are simply that you have a bachelors in a sciencerelated field i intend to apply when i finish my degree
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wish you lot the best its gonna be a shit show i imagine a sub like that will try to stamp down the kind of shit were expecting but its going to be hard to put out a forest fire
SubredditDrama,not_removed,further i saw a comment insisting that if theyre gonna mention white privilege they have to go into equal depth on black privilege hispanic privilege etc another guy said that hes probably going to unsub because mentioning white privilege in the op implies that white people are racist i cant fucking wait to read tomorrows thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am not sure what you are trying to say by your comment but i am all for bringing every issue to light and discussing it that way issues without merit can be identified and dismissed and those worth discussing similarly identified the only thing i am against is the censoring of ideas things like safe spaces are fine if you need a safe space but lately they are being confused with places that encourage intellectual discourse which they are definitely not intellectual discourse should be challenging and true discourse cannot occur under censorship
SubredditDrama,not_removed,great youre exactly the kind of person they dont want participating in the conversation in the first place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is better served in circlebroke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we need to make this a catchphrase
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or the billboard monsters from that simpsons episode just dont look
SubredditDrama,not_removed,love of enemy noncomplimentarian response
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of course
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was always a little confused by the idea of color blindness when i was a kid because you can obviously see what color someone is theyre standing in front of you then when i was older i was confused about it being a racist idea because im not saying i literally cant see color im just saying im not actually thinking about it until it becomes relevant now i just dont know what to say one way or the other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,color blind doesnt mean you cant see racism though i guess it depends on the person but i just use it to determine how i treat other people equally and fairly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but thats not what the discussion will be about its not gonna be a discussion on racism and its hipotetical scientific base its gonna be about racist bias in science and academia those stormfront copypasta would be irrelevant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what the mods are for to delete that bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the angle im coming from if the goal is to spread awareness of issues through discussion and perhaps changing some minds wouldnt shutting out laymen be counter to that goal how can you change someones mind if there is no venue to express this content where a layman might read it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,heres a crude approximation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,por que no los dos
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no field loves intellectual imperialism as much as physicists source physicist and thus expert
SubredditDrama,not_removed,duh because theyre scientists science isnt a methodology its a list of celebrities i approve of more than the other celebrities
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because everything else is just applied physics s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its the idea that because they are smart it applies to everything they do
SubredditDrama,not_removed,his criticism was on the standards of peerreview and repetition of studies both of which are related to the scientific method which should be applied to either field in the same way since its just a method the particular feynman quote seems well within his domain but him commenting on the actual findings of psychology papers would be different
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be clear he wasnt exactly writing about the field as it was in the and remember that he didnt really know anything about psychology the entirety of his knowledge and the basis of his criticism comes from an anecdote he once heard about some psychology research that he couldnt cite and the conflation of the field with psychoanalysis as for the replication crisis it seems odd to say psychology continues to have troubles in reference to that as the replication crisis is a problem inherent to science itself it only affects psychology because psychology is a science and its not a unique or special problem to psychology
SubredditDrama,not_removed,have other fields attempted large scale replication like the study psychology effort i dont think the pressure to publish significant results is limited to psychology
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is a replication problem throughout the sciences sociology is apparently doing worse than the median according to one study i saw referenced recently but not enough to be dismissive of the field physics does surprisingly poorly for example given its hard status
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus fucking christ what is caloric theory phlogiston aether anybody
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that other guy should be a hero find that article and have them sticky it to rscience
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rules are rules p
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id love to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair your dad was a fairly old new parent then hes pushing and youre only most people dont have a dad who was when they were born for comparison my mom was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats right thats how we legitimately do have a problem with thinking that everything happened a long time ago but those times ago never intersect
SubredditDrama,not_removed,makes more sense probably with a broken foot he wouldnt have been able to run at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yea if i ever drink straight its scotch otherwise its pints all the way down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrblackscienceman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,social progress definitely but i dont think that makes it political or maybe im using political in a different way to me saying something is political indicates that its biased towards a certain political viewpoint whereas the idea of racial bias in science just seems like an empirical fact in the same way that while conservatives generally make not agree with climate change rscience having a panel discussion on the facts of climate change wouldnt make it political
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and what we choose to study and pick apart is also influenced by our bias
SubredditDrama,not_removed,haha yeah that closes up that loophole nicely
SubredditDrama,not_removed,read on the top comments on each of those links effectively destroy the ops respective arguments beautifully
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i read the first one and despite the initial stupidity and denial of racism op managed to get his view changed after a while second one just needed one post citing previous posts on the matter apparently this is a frequent occurring post on cmv gee i wonder why
SubredditDrama,not_removed,starting to bring in other forms of ism transphobia sorry but i found that humorous
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah one of the comments was someone expressing their disgust at comments talking about trans people just being mentally ill being deleted as hate speech because its been definitively proven that trans people are just mentally ill im lucky im at home sick and not at the office today because otherwise i wouldve had to explain the sound of disgust that leapt out of my mouth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive already broken two pairs of jackboots today alone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your username brings back some very very visceral memories
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that way issues without merit can be identified and dismissed and those worth discussing similarly identified look im not comfortable with campus censorship although liberty or wheaton should hardly get a free pass here but lets not overstate the case when has an open forum ever ever ended with this happening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you suggest banning the discussion of privilege in regards to maintaining an open discussion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only thing i am against is the censoring of ideas things like safe spaces are fine if you need a safe space but lately they are being confused with places that encourage intellectual discourse which they are definitely not intellectual discourse should be challenging and true discourse cannot occur under censorship im a little confused by your comment here one of the textbook examples of an uncontroversial safe space is a scientific conference that is its a meeting area where there are specific rules of conduct i cant go to a scientific conference and call people faggots if there was a discussion on racial bias in science and people started citing the bell curve theyd be told to shut up or leave and if someone said something like white privilege but what about black privilege then they likely wouldnt be invited back again its not exactly that ideas are being censored its just that to have meaningful intelligent discussion you have to have ground rules about whats appropriate and a common understanding of the evidence so someone rejecting privilege or racial bias would be looked at the same as someone rejecting evolutionary theory theres no value in them being at a scientific conference having to explain to them why theyre wrong is a waste of everyones time because its a conference for a discussion on science not a lecture thats the value of safe spaces they allow for the discussion of new ideas and unheard perspectives to be thrown into the light they act in a similar way to trigger warnings by exposing people to new information that they couldnt access before
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow you badly misinterpreted that comment op was pointing out the ridiculousness of arguing that white privilege doesnt belong in a conversation about bias
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youd be better served in the hague
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant argue with that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,catchphrases are better served in circlebroke
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why would i love racists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah yes adulthood that magical time when you finally come to terms with the fact that things dont make sense and theres nothing you can do about it but exist until you dont
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when used in the context of someone denying or downplaying racism which is most contexts these days since the racism dont real crowd love to abuse the term it means that people should be judged by their qualities or qualifications and some of those just so happen to be proxies for race for example a colorblind admissions policy for a selective university might have admissions officers judge applicants on the depth and breadth of their extracurricular activities this discriminates by family income directly students from lowincome families are less likely to have a variety of extracurricular activities available less likely to be able to afford them and less likely to have parental support such as transportation since race and income are heavily correlated in the us this colorblind policy still discriminates by proxy on the basis of race in favor of white and asian applicants and against black latino and native american applicants broadly speaking so colorblind has become shorthand for the way things are now is okay there is no need for further action on issues of race which is pretty obviously bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is how it is ment to be used however with a lot of things people that dont understand the phrase apply meaning to it and perpetuate that use of the expression
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre misunderstanding thats not what color blindness is and the fact that you treat people equally doesnt make you racist imagine being genderblind to avoid sexism genderblindness in a workplace would essentially mean you dont give maternity leave because after all women are the exact same as men right equality doesnt mean everyone is exactly the same its like that for race only races dont have different physical characteristics rather each race faces different challenges due to past and ongoing discrimination of various sorts with the obvious example being black people and policejustice system discrimination to treat them exactly the same as white people might work fine in a workplace but not so much when the solution of the white moderate to racism is to say they should just act white and be treated white because we have implicit biases for one thing and for another a black person and a white person are not the same different experiences growing up different likelihoods of success different levels of exposure to bigotry different cultural background in many cases colorblindness is basically a way around addressing the problem this article might explain it a lot better than i can
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you cant discuss racial bias without discussing research on racial disparities which is where most of the citations in stormfront copypastas come from if there are statistics that suggest that any type of minority performs poorly in science or something along those lines then stormfronters will be able to use an evidencebased approach and drop them into the thread and most laymen wont have the skills to consider anything beyond the hard figures white supremacists recruit a lot of people and try to gain legitimacy by disseminating propaganda with a hard factsscientific angle so this is a great opportunity for them especially given that some of the stuff they do use as propaganda is genuinely important to discussions on race
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not only are there copypastas about minorities poor performance in stem but you cant really have a good discussion about racism in academia without discussion of the american eugenics movement and research on iq and race eg the bell curve racism in scientific research is a vital topic re racism in science
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they said theyd allow an evidencebased approach which means that stormfront will be free to post completely scientifically valid but contextremoved studies that further their agenda and the vast majority of readers wont have the knowledge to see anything beyond the fact that peerreviewed papers are saying that there are racial disparities theres a place for research on racial differences and discussions on racism in science but a forum of a few million laymen cant handle an evidencebased approach to race in order to discuss racism in science and the scientific study of race from an evidencebased perspective its important to understand research methods and things like epigenetics and child development otherwise its ripe grounds for white supremacist propaganda which has been developed for decades now to seem compelling and scientifically valid to laymen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shutting out laymen counters that goal but shut up and listen under the guise of a discussion does exactly that heavy moderation of this discussion that breaks the guise of having an open discussion is going to make people very hostile to what the panelists have to say the most important part of getting people to listen to you is to choose the most effective vehicle to carry your message for the given audience
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah yeah thats grampas face
SubredditDrama,not_removed,touche
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have an older coworker with a phd in astrophysics he will talk at length about why climate change isnt real andor humans arent the cause depending on the given day hes also an expert in many other fields which makes him sort of tough to talk to about anything other than just what work requires he seems like a generally good guy but this comic really illustrates him perfectly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that comic was written about richard dawkins wasnt it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no group loves intellectual imperialism as much as physics studentsfans source also a physicist the comments i see from people who love science are so much worse p
SubredditDrama,not_removed,economics is like that with the social sciences its amazing how we can piss literally everyone off on the political spectrum
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the problem was that he tried to criticise the entire field based on a story hed heard once about someones research ie he didnt know enough about the field to make criticise actual research even if the story was true theres debate about whether it exists since nobody seems to be able to track down a paper by young that matches his description it seems weird to criticise psychology as a whole for one minor forgettable thing then there was his other attempt to criticise psychology which basically amounted to conflating it with psychoanalysis so while he may have been trying to criticise a universal aspect of science as it applied to psychology he fell on his face
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lets be real the fact that light waves dont have a medium they propagate through is pretty weird and dont get me started on matter waves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair i dont think those are issues with replication were they they were just theories being overturned with new evidence and by explaining new predictions although people will generally appeal to old discarded theories of psychology as evidence that the field isnt scientific and i think there was someone doing it yesterday but i cant remember where maybe it was in rbadpsychology
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stupid rule
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is honestly my favorite srd rule
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like an ice cold gin on a hot day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt that kind of a subreddit that makes fun of reddit circlejerks that was my initial question to the scientist who posted earlier what his thoughts are about using terms like black science man to make fun of redditors
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ohhh i see your point biased sounds more negative than the positive connotations i applied to political
SubredditDrama,not_removed,either post something yourself or stop complaining almost every post in this sub is just a link this post is what i want it to be and theres nothing stopping you from doing more than just whining the absolute laziest thing someone can do online maybe youll have more fun going back to kia or thedonald and seeing all the insightful discussion there im sure there are a lot of people there that are upset that racists are getting banned too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ugh i feel like those people didnt really read the book my memory may be incomplete but they just seem to be citing the book to support some barely related conclusions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,top kek
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i was selecting it i just looked around the room and picked the first thing i saw my roommate was in the middle of wasting good booze my vomiting into a houseplant the rest is history
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow you badly misinterpreted that comment youre right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not the srd spirit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we are all catchphrases on this blessed day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to bring about change and stop the cycle of hate if you dont love them then you just help them remain in that position here is a good podcast talking about the idea httpswwwpodcastchartcompodcastsnprinvisibiliapodcastepisodesflipthescript
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well this is cynical
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt really acknowledge subconscious bias anyone can say they dont see colour anyone can say theyre not racist theoretically speaking idealistically speaking what matters is your actual behaviour though saying you dont see colour is basically excluding the possibility that you might subconsciously judge someone unfairly by their skincolour that your behaviour even without the intention of doing so shows prejudice not to mention it doesnt mean shit when society does see colour
SubredditDrama,not_removed,duh the stormfront copy pasta are bullshit science i almost wish they try to see them get roasted for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hence why its important the mods be super vigilant theyd be up against actual scientists this is in context of an ama on the subject so by its very nature subjective experiences are allowed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats pretty much exactly what were going to see and no one should expect anything different i dont have a lot of belief in reddits self proclaimed stem crowd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,following some of the drama already looks like the problem is with rscience more than reddit in general well i guess it is with reddit in general due to volume better to just have a standard panel discussion actually that would be fun to watch put some real racists in there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh i was expecting your grandpa to be more like this ╬⓪益⓪ he is one tough fella
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dawkins isnt a physicist though he does step outside his field with overconfidence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they love science in the same way they love backing the winning horse they care when it wins them arguments and makes them look smart but theyre not nearly as interested in being critical of facts and getting to the truth which is why theyll argue relentlessly with actual experts its less about loving science than it is about hating to lose an argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mathematics is just applied philosophy silly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres always a relevant xkcd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for fucks sake ive written this twice and got distracted twice and my fuckin phone has no memory to keep the page open while i order my drink anyway linked commenter makes reference to a constant linear development of chemistry and physics which for some stulid reason just assumes that the conceptual apparatus of every new hard scientific development fully subsumes and justifies the previous apparatus they make reference to the development of newtonian mechanics to qm and i dont know enough about that to refute their thesis but although phlogistonic theory had its contemporary merits its mad to believe that the chemical theory doesnt completely do away with its bad presumptions so yes its not about replication its about the linked users nonsequitur to a naive theory of how the hard sciences develop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in a sense yes but its also ironic comedy in its own right see rdankmemes as well for another example of this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ding ding ding their teacher probably reviewed it in class and thats as close as close as they ever got to reading it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i guess it would be better to say i dont care enough to argue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,k thats something to start off with if you dont people are gonna think youre a crazy pants
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not to mention people who claim they dont see color are also people who are not directly affected by racism negatively like its easy for a white person who grew up in white suburbia to not see color but impossible for a black kid who grew up in the hood
SubredditDrama,not_removed,adding to the discussion if race is just a social construct isnt saying i dont see color a way to distance oneself from it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you could not be racist or bigoted or anything but then not realize that you hire black people less often that white people thats not exactly statistically significant even if we assume its some higher rate is it racism if its unconscious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont see colour because im an american goddammit its color and the only colors i see are red white and blue and teal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats both true and not true the studies they cite are completely valid and they allow readers to draw their own conclusions to avoid turning them off with radical white supremacist preaching those copypastas are an appeal to statistics that snag people who fancy themselves scientifically literate but arent literate in behavioral genetics epigenetics cognitive psychology child development andor human research its the fact that they use legitimate research that makes those copypastas both hard to refute and easy to inject into discussions on race in science under the guise of bringing up legitimate discussion points before srd tightened the rules on flamebaiting we would have white supremacists come in and drop copypastas into threads from time to time and the response to them always seemed like an endurance race a handful of people would bring up some points about something easy to discuss like sample size which the white supremacist would refute with studies that have a large sample size then a smaller percentage of people would make a more informed critique about something like nature vs nurture or whathaveyou then the white supremacist would drop stuff like adoption studies twin studies and sescontrolled studies then if the thread was lucky maybe one or two people would bring up stuff like epigenetics prenatal development sociological factors and confounds in adoption studies re iq and the white supremacist at that point would usually drop in something related to race and epigenetics which the last remaining arguers would have to comb through to refute its really fucking hard to refute those pastas because you have to have a lot of information about a pretty broad spectrum of topics theyve had over a decade to refine them and they contain legit information theyre just not contextualized but it takes a lot of knowledge to put them into context thats why theyre so effective as propaganda
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think its the science thats bullshit more the fallacious conclusions being reached
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if theyre super vigilant then they will remove information that is necessary for discussion on race in science though you cant really have a productive discussion unless you do include research and statistics and some of that research paints minorities unfavorably thats why this idea was so fucking stupid either they allow racists to lowkey evangelize or you they dont allow for a real discussion at all and the panelists just get a platform for spreading their own agenda without having an actual conversation you just cant talk productively about race and science without things like the eugenics movement research on racial disparities in various topics minority performance in stem etc this is why you cant have a good conversation about race and science with a huge group of laymen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is his face getting squeezed by a pair of titties while he prays to jesus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,does dawkins have a field of knowledge outside of unbearable smugness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not a physicist or usually concerned with hard sciences but chomsky is the same way the nativist theory of language is really interesting and influential but most of what he talks about anymore is ir and hes not very good at it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to most people science isnt a methodology its just a latter day god
SubredditDrama,not_removed,philosophy is just the culmination of history up until that point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,philosophy is math done by people too drunk to major in it edit which is not to imply that mathematicians are sober
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for fucks sake ive written this twice and got distracted twice and my fuckin phone has no memory to keep the page open while i order my drink maybe your phone is trying to tell you that you shouldnt drink and reddit its not responsible but it is funny so yes its not about replication its about the linked users nonsequitur to a naive theory of how the hard sciences develop ah sorry yep youre right i thought you were responding to the replication bit of my comment but i forgot the other half of the quoted section i was responding to i think it was in fact the comment i was trying to remember above maybe im the one who needs to put the drink down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,perhaps nonetheless i just wanted to know if he had any thoughts on it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i may be that too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im always going to be civil and nice in person thats not however an option for the vague social currents and streams that make up movements culture memes and so on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right so the colorblind end up treating everyones experience as the same ignoring all the ways a minority experience is different which tends to perpetuate issues that impact minorities
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or acknowledge it if anything colorblind people inherently accept race as a social construct those who are not colorblind are implicitly accepting the divisions of race
SubredditDrama,not_removed,math rant time thats not what statistically significant means statistically significant means that we have found enough data to have the confidence to reject the null hypothesis that magnitude doesnt change if something is statistically significant a change could be statistically significant if you gathered enough data to show that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not exactly statistically significant i just want to reiterate that statistical significance is rigorously defined and this isnt what it means even if we assume its some higher rate is it racism if its unconscious colloquially yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how do you know the statistical significance with so many missing variables whats the sample size how sure do we need to be with our results what is the natural variance in the population is it racism if its unconscious yes this seems patently obvious
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think the panel is to raise awareness about issues with respect to racism in the sciences though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ehm yeah sure
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one of my majors was philosophyyeah i spent of uni drunk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe your phone is trying to tell you that you shouldnt drink and reddit its not responsible but it is funny fuck the internet i should have given up when i discovered paul lutus edit fun fact i hated sam harris before it was cool now everybody who knows me on that subreddit think its because of badphil internet fora are worse than useless bring back typewriters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do people call you brian
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats a good point thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who can say why they killed that man maybe it was his clothes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can not see color with regards as to how you treat somebody but it doesnt mean that you dont recognize what their skin color is and tell if someone is being racist towards them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youll never gather enough data in this case because this guy isnt hiring millions of people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then whats the point of the discussion at that point it just becomes a let me talk about my experience while you shut up and listen which isnt productive either especially in a subreddit full of people who are only convinced by hard data and want to be engaged in the discussion if the panel wants to raise awareness then thats fine but doing it under the guise of having a discussion and moderating to remove any actual productive discussion is just going to make people upset and unwilling to listen and it comes off as the panel just trying to inject their agenda into people without being challenged thats not the way to get people to listen to you in this particular setting in a community thats progressive and okay with the shut up and listen to my experiences form of discourse definitely in a gigantic fairly diverse group of people who prefer empirical data and enjoy debate recipe for disaster
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that sounds like him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,now everybody who knows me on that subreddit think its because of badphil if it ever comes out that badphil is just a handful of people talking about whisky and tv in modmail while unceremoniously banning any rando that makes their presence too conspicuous in the subreddit theres going to be a fair number of disappointed internet conspiracy theorists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i should have given up when i discovered paul lutus no man thats just when the internet starts getting good edit fun fact i hated sam harris before it was cool now everybody who knows me on that subreddit think its because of badphil internet fora are worse than useless bring back typewriters yeah id say me too but now it looks like im trying to jump on the hipster train i was a pretty insufferable new atheist but even in my glory days i couldnt stand harris id still defend him of course and talk about how reasonable he is but deep down i thought the guy seemed like a smug moron he was nowhere near as intelligent as my lord dawkins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is true to except for when a lot of the people saying i dont see color are only saying it in the context of systemic bias and racism doesnt exist i dont see color so i dont see the racism in front of my face this is where my frustration is with the phrase i want to use it because i feel represents how i think but then the deniers took the phrase over and ruined it you have to be aware of implicit unconscious bias that all people have on another note i kinda have a problem with this idea too i know that all people have biases but wouldnt it be fair to say not everyone is biased towards the same things i can pretty much pinpoint when i started having biases towards people of different races i think hopefully thats not arrogant and i know it only came about because i was introduced to the idea by other people i might not have ever interacted with in another life and it didnt even make a huge impact because i was almost instantly slammed by everyone about it theoretically couldnt we have people in the united states who simply are lucky enough to have experienced a childhood where they werent exposed to those biases or is racism just something that we think occurs naturally no matter what you are taught i dont personally buy that guys could we not do the rabid downvote thing this was actually a really enjoyable conversation
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess it just doesnt match my experiences which is to say i lean more towards the nurture side of the argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why would you continue playing a game if you seem to have never had anything but negative opinions on the game
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no
SubredditDrama,not_removed,meh seen better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sunk cost or i suppose it could be that their friend group plays it and they dont wanna be the odd one out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey tooism thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because this drama has already been featured for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey tooism thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because youve been warned previously for your submissions and how you center on pointing out bad behavior for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where i have looked through the past weeks submissions and it is nowhere to be seen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youve been warned previously for your submissions and how you center on pointing out bad behavior uh when i literally have no idea what youre talking about i really would like to know though because i have not made a habit of doing any such thing and am far more interested in providing the gross sticky popcorn that comes from people posting on nsfw or otherwise titillating content im not even doing what you suggest in this case either just describing what the instigator of this drama actually said its still dramatic anyway the other mods reason for removal makes much more sense so im fine with that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im thinking op must have deleted it but i remember seeing it here i had to ban a few people for popcorn pissing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you have had of threads removed from srd and at one point in a row so please familiarize yourself better with our submissions rules because a removal ratio is quite abnormal thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well fair enough i dont have access to the materials that the mods have as ive been trying to explain to your colleague but i dont dispute your account of this
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that doesnt answer my question when have i been warned previously for submissions center on pointing out bad behavior as for your other claim fair enough up to a point i do often forget about the surplus drama rules but oftentimes your mods have removed things ive posted even though they are only tenuously surplus at best i also object to you holding not enough drama removals against me if you are because this is a completely subjective evaluation and not something that i should be expected to predict nobody can anyway you have threads that are two days old still on your front page so i dont know why youre even worried about surplus drama to begin with i guess a dead sub is better in the meantime the other mod provided a totally reasonable and actually real reason for removing this so its all good edit actually fuck that there is no evidence this was submitted before and this is consequently a bullshit reason for removal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we discuss everything as a team review our submission guidelines or they keep getting removed simple as that you can keep complaining or you can simply follow the rules no one else is having half of their submissions removed were perfectly happy with our surplus rules thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when have i been warned for posting too much content that is focused on calling out bad behavior i dont dispute the need for rules and have always tried to follow them here i will redouble my efforts to do so in the future too and am sorry for having caused any trouble i am not looking to be a problem but look up at the bolded text please and fucking answer me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we have a modnote saying you have been previously warned to follow submission guidelines so now consider yourself warned
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how is this so hard for you you cant tell me that ive been previously warned for something when literally no warning has ever been given to me none of us can see your mod notes you know this right as for todays warning now youre just being petty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a note is added to a user when they have previously been warned so i operate under the assumption that you have been previously warned so once more since you cannot let a simple warning lie you have had of submissions pulled you have a modnote saying you have been previously warned you are now warned again follow our guidelines the end you may take the last word but our purpose here is done
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have always followed your guidelines or have at least tried to i take this very seriously look back upon my history of interactions with the mods since i know you can i have been unfailingly polite and determined to try better the problem is that your guidelines are needlessly subjective and provide a lot of room for actions like yours that make no immediate sense to submitters like me literally all i have ever done here is try to provide your subreddit with free content within the context of the established rules thats it why the fuck would i try to deliberately break those rules if ive been so committed to submitting here and supporting this community is your imagination really so stunted do you really believe that youre at the center of such a conspiracy there is nothing perfectly simple about this warning and that is why i am taking the trouble to actually talk to you like a human being do you just expect everyone to roll over for your vague whimsical unsupported commands we are not dogs you have no subreddit at all without people submitting things finally a note is added to a user when they have previously been warned so i operate under the assumption that you have been previously warned your system is a failure then because i literally never have been so warned i am telling you the absolute truth about this i have no shame about being warned for something if i have actually broken the rules but there is literally no actual precedent in this case and your system is a lazy lie all i can think of in terms of refutation is you seeking out the initial warningmessagesending from whatever account made it happen ill wait please do not think that i am lying about this i spend my time submitting links to people getting angry about boobs for heavens sake i have no shame whatsoever and certainly no need to pretend this account exists so i can post this content here and i have no interest whatsoever in deliberately or even accidentally making that harder to do i have no access to your mod note system and have never received any warning from you or any other srd mod about anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre escalating a small issue unnecessarily to such a degree that its baffling when most users receive a warning they go okay then go on enjoying reddit and simply adjust their behavior going forward according to our records you received a modnote being warned for thread submissions on march after have six threads in a row removed theres no reason for me to distrust a modnote but in the offchance it was made mistakenly then its much easier to say i didnt get this warning but ill be mindful of it moving forward not swear at me not insunuate were killing the sub not bold and italicize words effectively yelling at me via text its a simple warning i didnt say youre a bad person i didnt insult your taste in music or your family im saying the fact is you have had over of your submissions removed and this is not something that happens often you can blame those rules all day but we have many many users who manage to submit threads each month within our guidelines i can understand and appreciate that you have good intentions and i have never said you do not but your taste in drama is going to keep running you into these problems for well over months now we have been actively discouraging surplus drama from being posted for many months before that we have had a rule against thread titles pointing out bad behavior implying one user or side is wrong your thread today ran against both of those im talking to you as a human srd is not a sub to point out bad behavior if your drama niche is to wrap thirsty nerds upset about vagina in costume in a more srdflavored title youre going to keep running into thread removals so the adjustment is going to have to come from you or not come at all thats up to you take care
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you cant get through to this one dude ive tried just one of those mods that cant separate personal feelings from mod duties youve questioned him so youre on his and his buddy mods grudge list now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,next hes going to argue that making rectangular phones is illegal

SubredditDrama,not_removed,no dipshit its just that europe has consumer protection laws so we dont get all that compacted rat shit in our shops do all those consumer protection laws saving your delicate body from mediocre chocolate also protect you from mad cow disease oh wait europeans arent allowed to donate blood because of all the prions floating around or are you saying that you literally ate rat shit because you thought it was chocolate and you need laws to save you from doing that again at least they know what horse tastes like not willingly tho well i have to say ive learned quite a bit about the difference between american european food regulations s and no love for dark chocolate in the thread im pretty bummed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kinder must be pushing to be allowed in the us never heard much about them until lately
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hersheys does have a little bit of a sour vomitlike aftertaste to me but i hate it when people go hersheys is american chocolate so americans dont have anything better than hersheys its like ignoring cowgirl creamery because cheese whiz exists or saying we dont have any good restaurants because theyve only ever tried mcdonalds i had a nasty greasy pizza with little pieces of newspaper under the cheese once in italy but i dont go around telling people how disgusting italian pizza is because i recognize that theres more than one pizza place in the country

SubredditDrama,not_removed,dear lawd is it just me or is this a bible thumper looking for talking points meat is given by god or animals can give consent and children who reach puberty can consent i had a friend who reached puberty in grade but sure as hell she wouldnt be able to give informed consent dude is just spoiling for a fight
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i thought that said zootopia and i came in here expecting some discussion on the movie this isnt as fun
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i knew a witch who had sex with a pig it didnt go well she ended up with hogwarts but seriously my number rule for witches and wizards is dont get too familiar with your familiars
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not much drama just a really creepy guy looking for an excuse to fuck animals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nope nope too early for this tapping out

SubredditDrama,not_removed,whoa grade its crazy how young some kids are able to consent these days
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think so i think he just wants validation to have sex with animals
SubredditDrama,not_removed,zootopia was one of the most woke movies of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the rest of the post has some too but i just linked to the longest chain
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wonder if thats because the pedophiles upvote the zoophiles
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt it tho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what were the other contenders
SubredditDrama,not_removed,repost to drama or make a text post itll prolly get removed here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah man personally i think consent should be based on art and crafts if theyre still using macaroni and paper plates thats a deal breaker
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my sextape
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant go to drama i heard theyre the new srs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what about string art many a childs day is spent in the fine art of string paintings
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is drama an actual srs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hang on lemme ask oxus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fak u srs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,reading the title i wouldve assumed it was montecristo
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ugh commentator drama is always so petty and its worse when two of them are indirectly putting each other down what happened to dont shit in the place you eat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,imo this post made me lose a bit of faith in the smash community welp there goes my karma
SubredditDrama,not_removed,clicked expecting him too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you just be a virgin if you think being circumcised makes you good with women ask your boo dude see whether im a virginia or not lol i asked and she said he was a west virginia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,foreskin is a gateway for filth and you will probably die one day because of it this would make an awesome flair
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my johnson is aerodynamic thats a new one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,where do these people come from commenting on porn a little weird but whatever but putting your dick away to get into an argument about circumcision though thats kinda fucked thats probably a lesser known fetish orgasming to internet arguments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that guy talking about being born without a foreskin is obviously trolling right i mean no one exists thats that stupid someone reassure me im scared
SubredditDrama,not_removed,every time this subject comes up i have urge to wash my cock
SubredditDrama,not_removed,always fun watching srd pretend to be above this topic while still getting pissed off anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yay another thread where reddit tells me my penis is wrong and that my parents abused me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no idea why he was downvoted phimosis isnt attractive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if we just go from the video its apparent theyre finished having sex and the position of his foreskin doesnt matter that being said if you legit have phimosis it doesnt even go down as far as it does in the video
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why are anticircumcision folks so batshit insane i agree that circumcision needs to end but i dont want to be associated with these people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i personally have never been with a guy who isnt circumsised but i wouldnt care either way as long as it worked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man us humans can really find a side to take on anything cant we but this is one of the few debates where everyone needs to shut their fucking mouths and not let a debate as stupid as this one even happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was expecting gary johnson drama for some reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i really dont get the you americans comment isnt circumcision just as common in europe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats like comparing oranges and appleachias is it not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait are virginians ever called virgins for short
SubredditDrama,not_removed,too bad its too long
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like the srd appropriate version better drama is a gateway for filth and you will probably die one day because of it or perhaps like this popcorn is a gateway for filth and you will probably die one day because of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i tagged him as circumcised with an agenda
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gateway for filth is a pretty cool band name
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im gonna go precarve that into my tombstone tomorrow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,small things are usually aerodynamic right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think that might be a reference to that shitty jack black movie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httppornhubcommentsonstockphotostumblrcom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think i heard somewhere that people who get off on being talked down to will act like an idiot on the internet and jerk it as people berate them ive never heard anyone say they did it though so until i do im just going to consider it an urban legend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you assume they put their dicks away to argue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,actually i think of it as a sign of progress that people comment on porn as long as we keep sex related things in their own special place then they will remain taboo once we reach the point where porn is considered just as a mundane form of entertainment as sports or cartoons we will have officially gotten over sex as a society
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wish i could reassure you but sadly some people are just that stupid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ignoring that guys stupidity there has to be someone in the entire history of the human race born with that birth defect right just statistically
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is actually a congenital condition where a child can be born without a foreskin httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaposthia im curious if girls are ever born without clitoral hoods since thats analogous to the male foreskin i dunno though but id bet that it happens of course someone with aposthia would also lack the scarring of someone whos been circumcised so it would probably look different from your average circumcision
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hope hes trolling as well but sadly im sure people that stupid do exist also theres a lot of people who dont really know anything about their own anatomy too there are quite a lot of women who think they pee out of their vaginas for example or people not knowing that sex might lead to pregnancy it honestly wouldnt surprise me if some dude thinks he was born with his foreskin cut away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and then what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,repeatedly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so help me god if you block my drama fix
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no pretending i am above it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,let me be the first to tell you that your parents are wrong and your penis abused you then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yay another thread where reddit tells me my penis is wrong and that my parents abused me dont you just love them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it amazes me at reddits ability to judge decisions that were made years ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,edit meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh thats all of you thats what all of you sound like edit off topic i keep smelling sandalwood in places where it wouldnt be and nobody else smells it should i go to the doctor edit you bitches dont get my greatness also i do have issues with circumcision even though i lost my train of thought and got proud of myself for not writing haiku about my penis i know its weird to say but ive started to think of it as a form of abuse their is no proper penis just preferences being forced on the child surgically i think anytime you cut up a child without their consent to suit aesthetic preferences it is a form of abuse i mean ive got an uncut cock i have no real preference for what kind of cock goes in me i guess cause i went through a bunch of european butt pounding where it was normal why do i feel like i only ever comment about sex and emotional issues im a wastebasket of neuroses cum on my face big daddy why didnt you ever love me edit changed proper cock to proper penis i like alliteration ever since i took a poetry class to fill out classes in grad school shall i compare thee to a proper penis let me count the ways edit fuck it why not shall i compare thee to a proper penis thou art more lovely and more temperate cuddly like a fluffy kitten genus and my erection hath all too short a date sometime too hard the eye of weasel shines and often is his brown complexion dimmed and every fair from fair sometime sticky by chance or hygienes careless lack untrimmed but thy eternal summer shall not soft nor lose possession of that shaft thou owst nor shall flaccid thou wandrest in his shade when in eternal lines to time thou growst lol so long as i can breathe or eyes can see my use of tongue and suction gives life to thee i really fucked up the iambic pentameter its been a while forgive me edit wait i have a haiku white walls surround us we tend our sacred garden our minds of angels see not everything i write is about penises is it still haiku if it employs enjambment to ease the word flow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because porn subs are rather circlejerky about literally anything that isnt nice tits or i wish that was me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a balloonlike swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination shudder eeeeew
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know man a lot of hentai seems to feature it prominently
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont know about attractiveness but that definitely looks extremely uncomfortable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can treat phimosis with steroid cream and stretching dont need to jump to surgical intervention right away
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but its gone by puberty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hear hear like im very against it because you shouldnt do medically unecessary stuff to someone elses body but jesus christ i feel the same way about vegetarians which i am and atheists which i am like can you motherfuckers calm down a little
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its more that batshit insane people are more likely to comment more likely to comment more frequently etc you can see this with almost any drama producing topic on the site ie a person who really likes grilled cheese sandwiches but isnt obsessed with them isnt going to go on a tirade about melts sprinkle in the kind of defensiveness and insecurity that only comes for discussion of ones anatomy and youve got the recipe for unending unpleasantness
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stuff like this is probably why fact if you are uncircumcised you are wrong foreskin is a bacteria magnet uncircumcised penises have trillion times the amount of bacteria than circumcised think your dick hoodie is so great because it tingles a bit more when you piss and splooge how about when you get nut cancer and urinary tract infections and hundreds of other diseases foreskin is a gateway for filth and you will probably die one day because of it the world health organization even days there is no scientific evidence of superior sexual stimulation due to foreskin plus its evolutionarily moot foreskin was there to let us know if a spider was crawling up our dicks we dong walk around naked anymore so it serves no purpose why are you reading this and not snipping off your useless flap no one likes to be told that their genitals are wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was circumcised without my consent and although its not the end of the world i can get worked up knowing that a part of me was chopped off for little reason and there are those who want to perpetuate the practice ive made a habit to block out these sort of comment threads so i hope im not making a mistake for posting here chance the comment will get downvoted and a bunch of people telling me circumcision is the best thing ever and to go fuck myself with my cut dick and chance people will be sympathetic ill get but thats my reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but then what would we do here all day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people cant handle the subject of genitals rationally if somebody does something to their genitals that you dont suddenly you have to stand up and be counted in defense of your preferred genital norms
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was talking with friends about circumcision the other day most assumed it was something that only happened in third world countries im in ireland
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no not at all in europe its mainly only jews and muslims who get cut depending on the country around of men are circumcised contrasted with approx in the usa in my country the doctors national medical association of doctors is lobbying to get circumcision for nonmedical reasons outlawed and they routinely refer to it as mutilation same with the neighbouring countries doctors and paeditricians associations nordics general circumcision rate occasionally in here the police have investigated nonmedically necessary circumcisions as aggravated assault in denmark the danish medical association is rather aggresively trying to get circumcision banned as mutilation and child abuse and its speculated that they might actually ban it which would lead to a sort of domino effect in the nordics the royal dutch medical association also equates circumcision with female genital mutilation and suggests that theres just as good reasons to ban it as there are for fgm and in germany a court in cologne ruled nonmedical circumcisions without the consent of the person being circumcised illegal but the german government interfered to make sure it stays legal so that they wont oppress on the cultural traditions of jews and muslims but its not at all like in the usa where apparently a lot of parents have their kids circumcised even though theres no medical or religious reason for it just out of habit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to my knowledge outside of the us its largely non existent outside of legit medical or religious reasons i think there are a few exceptions like the phillipines and korea where they do it for the same social norms as america forgive me if im wrong but outside of there the only places youll see it done on a widespread scale is in muslim countries israel and in parts of africa for cultural reasons httpiimgurcomsbfcrdcpng
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its far less prevalent than it is in north american
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id say its closer to comparing apples and orange county
SubredditDrama,not_removed,virginia acted da micky
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what are yougay yea
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you have died of foreskin gateway filth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,darn mods snipping away and mutilating our available flairspace
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not what she said wink wink on a serious note ive seen text flair thats easily times that length
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what she said
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oooh i like that second one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he was born that way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,let me know when they cut their first album
SubredditDrama,not_removed,untrue planes are huge and they have crazy aerodynamics also earth is the biggest thing in the world and it flies through space mega fast js
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if she his mom why doesnt he call her mom
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are people with humiliation kinks sooo maybe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiaposthia
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i will dry it then put it back in with the hens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if i wash my cock thats just me jerking off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and i abuse it right back perpetuating the circle of abuse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyve been named unesco world heritage sites legallyprotected landmarks which are supposed to remain untouched sounds about right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who my parents no they abused me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,insert political comment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like youre overestimating reddits average age by at least years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,especially one where there is no overwhelming definitive evidence for either case im circumcised it was done because at the time it was what was considered medically the best option my parents were not yokels talked into it by some quack trying to make a fast buck my dad just finishing his first medical fellowship he would do two more after i was born to become a head and neck surgeon it wasnt some uninformed choice it was made with years of experience in the medical field
SubredditDrama,not_removed,their is no proper penis well time to throw away all my formal peniswear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a cherry blossom in the winter my glans hides behind a petal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this piece of art belongs in a gallery youre a visionary ahead of your time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,once i was so cold i was more foreskin than man when i went to have a pee it kinda filled up i got very panicy about where it was gonna go once it made its way out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mostly why i said it wasnt attractive tbh the affected guys pain would be offputting to their partners probably
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not always unfortunately ive heard quite a few stories of either the foreskin or the frenulum or both ripping during sex due to the condition
SubredditDrama,not_removed,false exhibit a look at the post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey we should form a club or something vegetarian atheists against circumcision but not rabidly screaming about any of it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot of vegetarians dont bring it up so you dont even know they exist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no one likes to be told that their genitals are wrong this um cuts both ways edit from another thread about circumcision good for you you barbaric being i hope the screaming of your infant rings through your head for years and i hope he eventually resents you for not giving him a choice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seems like a huge uncertainty though haha i dont really doubt it but not particularly useful as a map when the numbers are so vague
SubredditDrama,not_removed,worst oregon trail playthrough ever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right i couldnt even fill in this oscar wilde quote fully
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id be uncircumsurprised if it ever penetrates the market
SubredditDrama,not_removed,earth doesnt fly through a physical medium the aether is just not so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wish i had a detachable penis it sounds so convenient
SubredditDrama,not_removed,strokes or less and youre good fam
SubredditDrama,not_removed,self abuse is the best abuse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,choking the chicken suddenly got real
SubredditDrama,not_removed,according to the mods apparently my circlebrokeish comment is bad but yours is good teach me your ways
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who my parents no they abused me wow such a selfish attitude not all of us are lucky enough to get plastic surgery on our cocks as infants you know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,banned from rbadhistory
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am communist cocksucker i will take you in in your pauper penis garbs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have inspired an erotic kobayashi issa has anyone else done anything around here huh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,apparently it explodes and goes everywhere but dont quote me on that im female
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shit lol i will definitely be communicating this story the next time im in a foreskin conversation thats hilarious oh god
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fistbump my brother
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sureto start later the scope creep will happen and youll be posting advice animals about sri lankans being the source of all the worlds problems
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what is i dont have an opinion on circumcisions can i still join
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tbh i can understand the anger im anticircumcision though im a cis woman so it wasnt done to me atheist and though im not vegetarianvegan i can acknowledge that a lot of aspects of meateating western culture are morally suspect and definitely very cruel to animals when i got into intactivism anticircumcision activism i was mocked for it by friends and family told why does it matter so much to you as if something should matter to me based on how it affects me rather than is it a moral or ethical told i was making a mountain out of a molehill told to shut up when i got visibly angry talking about a little boy who had lost the entirety of the skin of his penis testicles lower stomach and upper inner thighs due to an infection after circumcision when i became angry thinking about how my thenboyfriend had been circumcised and apparently had some nerve damage to his penis i was told by a ftm friend that at least your partner has a penis and again told that my issues over what had happened didnt matter etc i read a lot of stories from guys who had had terrible damage done to them because of being circumcised as infants damage that would last their entire lives google shane peterson circumcision and their pain was just added to by it just being swept under the rug for much of their lives i felt that if even one persons life was so affected this was wrong it was a form of human rights violations and it needed to end when i started researching intersex genital mutilation i felt even more strongly about the values of intactivism based on simple human rights regardless of gender identity or sex at birth ive heard stuff about complications from nonconsensual surgeries that are even worse and more frequent than male circumcision horror stories honestly when you get told over and over that what you care about doesnt matter you get angry and you get defensive and you get prone to really lashing out ive tried to tamp that down in recent years because im an ally and i dont have the right to speak for all circumcised men or all circumcised transwomen or intersex people but it does still make me angry because in some way it is something i will have to live with and confront im angry that my culture tells me that as a straight woman i prefer a circumcised penis i dont im angry at the thought that most partners i have will likely be cut im angry at the thought that circumcising my child should i have a child and it be a boy is an option im angry that more people dont speak up about this and if we do were labeled perverts or weirdos and stupid hippies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup what im saying is that the vocal minority really makes the rest of us look like crazy assholes because they cant hold a reasoned discourse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree this is why the arguments are always so endless one side says the other is deformed and wrong so they say no we are the right way youre deformed and wrong and so the first side responds similarly and its all just a giant cycle because we cant accept each others penises
SubredditDrama,not_removed,still shows that the majority of europeans and the rest of the world dont partake in circumcision
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you misspelled best
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cum on have a little faith
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you sound foolish my man earth cant just be floating through nothing it would just sink to the bottom due to gravity were that the case we are very obviously suspended in a fluid of some kind probably air or water maybe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the masses arent ready for you yet i had to really dumb down your content to reach these fools stay golden my dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hi female im dad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fistbump sister
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anything to spread the truth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as long as you arent rabidly screaming about not having an opinion on circumcision sure
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think theres anything wrong with being passionate or getting angry about something you believe in especially when it comes to bodily rights male and female circumcision are just wrong on so many levels but being unable to have a discussion about something without it devolving into an argument with name calling and rabid screaming on either side is not productive and will never change anyones mind i talk about the things i am passionate about to anyone who asks my goal is to try to have a reasoned reasonable discussion about the topic i keep reiterating facts and disengage if they start yelling or calling names because emotion causes them to shut down and that doesnt do anything except reinforce their beliefs i could easily get pissed off at those who see no problem with eating meat for every meal or those who preach their beliefs and are super judgemental or those who wont vaccinate their children or those who dont think twice about circumcising their kid or those who call women murderers for having abortions i could go on and on but all that does is make me angry and make them angry and that is not productive sorry i guess i ranted there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unfortunately that applies to gaming and programming and probably everything involving humans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man it seems youre only good for makin jokes about your jimmy well heres a jimmy joke about this drama that you might not like their jimsre never used for layin pipe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my mistake old chap turtles all the way down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ancient wisdom baby
SubredditDrama,not_removed,congratulations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my apologies we shall be quietly principled sisters together
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think i can do that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey it wasnt any more of a rant than my post lol i totally see where youre coming from and i totally agree going overboard can also work to discredit to a degree i mean if youre right youre right ones arguments as well im reminded of this vegan person who i used to be fb friends with who was very passionate about veganism and would always be posting these emotionallydriven memes and opinions about it and animal rights in general he repeatedly posted peta memes even after i told him that peta kills thousands of dogs and cats who could have otherwise been adopted his rationale was still well they do a lot of good too and theyre visible as well as all the other morallyshady shit peta gets up to that is really racist antisemitic and misogynistic the last straw was when he posted some rant about a government bureau proposing doing a culling of deer i think in a government park and how horrible that was and how the people doing the culling should all be shot because theyre animal rapists and torturers i responded that they were proposing doing a culling because there were too many animals for the land to support and said animals would soon be starving to death it wasnt like they just had some beers and thought about going and shooting animals for funsies no amount of saying that could make him back down from saying they were animal torturers and should be killed in response and that it was more ethical to have thousands of animals starve to death rather than be shot oh he was also an intactivist and posted some borderlineracist stuff about jewish privilege when it came to circumcision rights i would always have to be the one to tell him that no its not that jewish people are more privileged in america its that america has a hardon in general for religious and parental rights over the rights of a minor child that hasidic people are a powerful voting bloc in places like nyc and that in general people dont want to appear antisemitic when they talk about stuff like circumcision even though the vast majority of american people who are cut as infants are nonjews
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see this is how you have a discussion sensible folks admitting wrongs and sensible folks accepting their apologies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ironically what i said in the delivery room was also hi female im dad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah sestra
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then you are part of the club if we ever meet up make sure to bring chips and dip okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly when we yell and pull on heartstrings by invoking emotional rhetoric we end up being just as bad as the people who hold opposing views just be the change you want to see in the world not everyone has to agree with you eventually someone will ask why you believe what you do and you can just tell them without demeaning them side story i am an atheist and have been working at a catholic charity do i agree with the church nope but they provide housing and resources for domestic violence victims and refugees and are generally just good people they dont judge me and they know i dont believe i dont judge them because they are doing good work also they pay me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt reddit a wonderful place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,aye aye guac ok
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hell yes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good ill make sure to add extra garlic all human beings know that unless it has cloves of garlic or a cup of sugar its not really food but seriously some people dont understand that its not fucking guacamole if you cant taste the garlic its just mushy avocado without the food of the gods
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i absolutely love garlic so much in everything i like avocado by itself but you are absolutely right about it not being guacamole with no garlic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,avocado is amazing but it really needs to be paired with something its good on salad on sandwiches although it would be better as guacamole but its not a strong enough flavor by itself to be a dip or topping
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think avocado by itself is appealing to me just because of its texture not much flavor at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it does have a really nice texture it does have a flavor but in the way that rice has a flavor its fairly boring on its own but provides a good backbone to mix other flavors in with also i like how this thread about circumcision has turned into a discussion of how awesome garlic and avocados are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love this sub so much for the digressions and i am now craving guacamole thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i want guacmole too i just realized that todays my birthday and i havent spoken to a single person today i have so much food though my entire family decided that since im in college that the best birthday present would be snack food so i now have fucking bags of chips the hell and i supposed to do with that i could deal with bags of cookies i already have dealt with but i cant eat that many chips
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what happy birthday 🎉 i would suggest making a metric shit ton of guac and eating all the chips with all the guac and if youre so inclined drink all the beer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sick username man one and two happy birthday get schwifty and shitpost til the morning light
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well since im under the legal drinking age thatll be hard who am i kidding i totally dont have a fridge full of cheap shitty beer but its bear so its good enough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks do you know what its a reference to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh sorry i assumed and made an ass out of me totally do not drink that beer that would be wrong pffft drink it drink all of it have a good time its your fucking birthday
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i took a little french and recognized it as girllady of the night not sure if theres a deeper reference here but i get a huge kick out of french curses and such first word i looked up in my english to french dictionary back in my schooling days was prostitute
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my qualifications for discussing things is that i have a access to the internet thats all thats required suggesting otherwise exposes your elitist and trite point of view the internet was a mistake

SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean conservatives trotted out this argument with obama black people are only voting for him because hes black yeahthats why ben carson had so much black support and why women just flocked to sarah palin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ladies as a male foreigner with a poor grasp on your countrys politics and current affairs let me tell you about hillary clintons campaign and why youre all silly and entirely wrong because you undoubtedly are choosing her exclusively due to her genitalia this is not sexist because its true even if youre incapable of understanding that and wrongly disagreeing with me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jesus christ im not voting for clinton because shes got a vagina im voting for her because she seems like a pretty decent candidate on her own and most importantly shes not a living breathing poorly written cartoon caricature of an idiot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is like the last two elections when democrats were told by people like this not to vote based on race it never seems to occur to them that race or gender are just an incidental sprinkles on the sundae at most i think its projection they would vote based on something like that so of course everyone else would as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one of the ops comments in that thread contains i am really not qualified to comment on american politics though then why the fuck did you make the thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and for those who repeatedly asked me why it bothers me that this is taking place people are actually doing the opposite you can try to shame women all you want for not voting the way you wanted them to but there are people who are actually willing to admit theyll never vote for a woman any woman httpwwwtruthrevoltorgnewsflashbackaynrandshocksfemalecrowdiwouldnevervotewomanpresident
SubredditDrama,not_removed,from what hes seen clintons campaign is all about her being a woman bro needs to stop getting his us politics from reddit it bothers me that something so patronizing can be upvoted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wouldnt the reverse be true then i mean i feel like theres going to be a lot of people who dont vote for hillary cause shes a woman im sure theyll find something wlse meaningless to blame it on though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im stealing this from someone else but i take solace knowing they cannot downvote the history books because its gonna be in there no matter how upset they are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a clinton voter but yes if youre voting for her based solely on her genitals its a pretty open and shut case
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i have really never seen such a textbook or binderful of mansplaining
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hours upvotes comments im ready
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey yourepatheticlydumb thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because you used a biased title remain as neutral as possible when creating a title a good title catches attention without making untrue statements or implying a certain side is in the wrong this is surplus popcorn and not enough drama to warrant a post for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean conservatives trotted out this argument with obama black people are only voting for him because hes black when people bring this up i always mention that for every person who voted for him because he was black theres one who voted against him because hes blackmuslimlizard people etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if anything the fact that donalds voting coalition is white men id say this is all projection
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of black voters voted for obama in hes very likeable and all but thats about as big of a landslide as any demographic has hit as far as i can tell while obviously not every black person voted for him because of skin color id say theres undoubtedly a decent bump from it and it showed with how many more blacks showed up at the polls all that said if you only look at it through that lense it does look incredibly racially charged the black vote for democrats in general in and was almost so were not talking like a double digit move of support because of skin color reality is nearly all black people are going to be voting democrat in most elections skin color sex etc can probably help your numbers but it looks like you still need to be a decent candidate in the first place
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not disagreeing with you but i think the argument was that white people were voting for him because he was black as well i dunno
SubredditDrama,not_removed,clearly women are just hoping that the magical vagina mindmeld that takes place when the glass ceiling is broken will cause all men to become slaves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this would be more relevant if i havent literally heard from men and women that they are voting for her because of her vagina
SubredditDrama,not_removed,let me tell you about why youre all silly and entirely wrong because you undoubtedly are choosing her exclusively because of genitalia proceeds to not tell us why this is true nor back up his argument its not sexist if its true
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nope its clearly just because of your vagina duhhhh get with it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,women supporting hillary purely on the basis of her gender is a for all those shrieking that this is a straw woman argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,out of curiosity since you seem like a levelheaded clinton supporter whats your take on the whole email situation it seems to me like she was either intentionally deceitful or horrendously incompetent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she did however commit election fraud so you have the cartoon caricature of an idiot or the cartoon caricature of a dictator source
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it never seems to occur to them that race or gender are just an incidental it also seems to never occur to them that maybe their opposition to the candidate in question is just as plausibly influenced by identity politics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because hes a man who needed to tell women they were wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like this post and your comments clearly breaks srds no soapboxing rule not sure why this thread hasnt been removed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well even for those select people that their primary reason is because she is a woman its not the only reason thats why it becomes a strawman to suggest its the only reason it simplifies things way too much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look at this thread im getting attacks and taunts from drama all over for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im guessing he didnt watch the convention
SubredditDrama,not_removed,careful i suggested that and gained some new fans from drama
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the texas board of education down votes history books
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is no one doing that it is a straw man used to belittle the idea that anyone can see her as a qualified candidate without voting with their vagina you can insult me and those like me but the opposite is happening and no one will talk about it httpwwwtruthrevoltorgnewsflashbackaynrandshocksfemalecrowdiwouldnevervotewomanpresident this is no more pathetic then calling mexicans rapists sure there may be a mexican rapist but if doesnt make the statement true ohh and crying to the mods until you found one bernie fuck to ban me is beyond pathetic i may be biased against the sexist bullshit but this thread title isnt biased your candidate lost you cant just lie and pray no one notices peace you pathetic bernie bots hopefully you have a counselor on hold of in november suicide is not the answer yet it is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,boy this argument kept going the people who are voting that way are a small minority who arent going to change their minds its more likely theyre voting for her because she is a democrat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,phrases like mansplaining and checking privilege get a bad rap on reddit but they have actual substantive meanings this op a nonamerican nonwoman attempted to explain to a bunch of american women why he knew more about their reasons for voting for hrc than all american women while demonstrating absolutely no qualifications that mightve made his explanation anything but condescending textbook mansplaining
SubredditDrama,not_removed,stating the people are only voting for her because shes a woman which is exactly what is done is the definition of sexist reducing woman to their genitals and implying that none of us are capable of seeing a qualified candidate just because she has a vagina makes me want to hit someone people told black people the only reason they voted for obama was the color of his skin and it is really sad how that has become an actual acceptable line of logic to be used against him as well as other black people in this country
SubredditDrama,not_removed,move along
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is a perfectly apt description of the drama though op might be biased but the titled sure isnt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you could also bring up the fact that john kerry got pretty much the same percentage of the black vote i think clinton is polling even higher amongst blacks thanks to trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some of us want to vote for the
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sorry for all the hate youre getting op it would be cool if people would stop insulting you while brigading
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is almost always true for democrats hillary might beat that number
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt necessarily mean racism though a black person could vote for obama because they think that they being black are better suited to fix the various issues that black people face hed had perspectives and insights and many nonblack people might be lacking similar could be applied to hillary for women shed be more likely to have insight into social and legal problems that women face compared to most men of course thats all a generalization and it begs question as to whether this different perspective actually matters and certainly there are black people who dont act in the best interests of other black people and women who dont act in the best interests of other women i thought sanders showed he had very fair and level headed views on most social issues and thus making the whole thing moot when compared to him of course when we compare hillary to trump well hes a pretty sexist and racist dude or comparing obama to romney
SubredditDrama,not_removed,blacks always vote with such high percentage to democrats the change was turnout
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and also saw some of the highest voter turnout among black voters since the it will be interesting to see what the turnout looks like for this election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,looked like there was a ton of drama downthread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,magical vagina mindmeld awesome the apocalypse shall begin when all women have the same cycle we have been working on it for centuries but hillary becoming president shall begin the prophesied downfall of men and will usher in the age of the bleedening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well now that you mention it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im already a slave to imgur and reddit i literally dont have time to take job if i did it would be stack overflow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,protecting women is her policy not something that happens because of her vagina
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how many of those people voted for mccain and palin in that was a woman with a good chance of becoming president voting for president is both rational and emotional there may be an emotional reason like shes a woman but if she had positions that were anethema to the voter then her gender wouldnt matter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah so sexist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait does voting for hillary automatically give you a vagina if you dont have one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the funny thing is i think the whole email scandal business almost worked in her favor for a lot of people you had all these people screaming about how terrible it was that she was being so irresponsible so corrupt whatever just constant condemnation and vitriol and then you read about what actually happened and youre like so she had some exchanges on a server she shouldnt have and basically nothing came of it huh well i guess thats sort of shitty and you end up thinking less of the people bitching about her than you do about her even though it was kind of a shitty thing she did so i guess my take is basically that it was a bad thing but it wasnt bad enough to make me vote against her now im going to bed because im drunk and tired night
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not the person you asked this question of but i see the dnc email circlejerk going on in all subs where this election is a discussion and i find it pretty bizarre how out of touch with reality reddit is on this specific issue first of all on the scale of scandals the email leaks are a soft out of and thats generous reddit is treating this scandal like its a watergate in its entirety from recording to pardon was a some leaked emails that expose politicians are assholes who lie and bend the rules is only more than a if youve never paid attention to an election before in your life its like nobody on reddit was alive when swiftboating or mccain v bush south carolina happened both conventions have always favored candidates and both parties have always had candidates who use dirty tactics to win and its always been known that doesnt mean hard evidence isnt a story but its exactly as big a story as it is outside reddit which is as i said a mild scandal at best second reddit has gone so far off the reservation in terms of their understanding of this election thay going on rpolitics right now feels like visiting a parallel dimension the email leaks are currently the most glaring example of this if you follow politics in any way outside of reddit you will see that this election is about a guy that most of the public find very unpredictable and uncomfortable challenging a lady who most of the public dont feel like they know or can trust the email leaks feed into the latter concern on clinton slightly if you only use reddit for your political info youd think hillary had dead children in the trunk of her car based only on the outrage being expressed about her now redditors can feel however they want to feel im not trying to tell anyone their outrage isnt justified if you think the emails prove that bernie sanders has the nomination flat out stolen from him immorally if not illegally excercise your right to be pissed but understand this reddit this year is a fringe minority in their political opinions the vast majority of voters do not share the opinions of rpolitics that wasnt always true during past elections but it is this year in the past the arguments you saw on the politics sub were at least entertained by the mainstream in discussion for better or worse nobody outside reddit and maybe pol gives a fuck about the email leaks and they arent going to mostly i find this entertaining because of the implications this has for political discussion on reddit in november i dont know if hillary is going to win there is a lot of campaign left to go but i know that the things reddit thinks will beat her wont be a factor shes going to win the women latino black and centrist votes unless she commits a felony on camera both parties are going to lose votes to third parties this year but trump is going to lose republican voters to hillary voters who would have voted r if youd asked them in december and no one is talking about that on reddit there are no democrats who will be voting for trump that werent going to vote r regardless of the nominee anyway the polls are foggy but the odds favor establishment candidates because unlike reddit of voters favor stability and familiarity trump is not that in the likely event that hillary wins in november the politics subs are going to go full conspiracy we will be told that hillary rigged the outcome that voters were gullible and bought into lies that the system is rigged to block out third parties and favor the establishment that hillary made backroom deals to get wall street funding and so on but at the end of the day people will have voted for her because she has a political resume and trump doesnt thats really all it will come down to and if trump does win itll be by less than a percent and without a mandate and reddits echo chamber will get louder and the prevailing opinion here will move even farther from the mainstream and srds election megathread will break karma in record time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shes an old person and not the first secretary of state to basically ignore infosec its a problem with most of our politicians not understanding technology and overruling their infosec teams if they have them at all the obvious solution is give it teams the power to overrule government officials in their charge on infosec matters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,listen its obvious that this is an alt account op be careful because this can get you permabanned and although i am in agreement with you in spirit you have kind of gone whacko in this thread why couldnt you just post and let discussion happen rather than jump on every single reply in the thread you completely have been trying to dominate discussion its a little ott
SubredditDrama,not_removed,get outtahere putin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the fact that the party was mean via email about your candidate isnt election fraud
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not election fraud
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly every problem i have with clinton is ramped up to eleven with drumpf its a choice between a candidate id rather not have versus a protofascist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is like statistically proven that men are voting with their dicks huh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,drama hasnt even linked this thread yet do you only percieve what matches your preconceived notions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she says shes a woman but it looks like it was made w a throwaway so who knows really
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the old everybody who has another position than me on twox is a man
SubredditDrama,not_removed,addressing the historical relevance isnt making it all about being a woman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt look like thats what happened at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,slavery was cool af for black people free transatlantic cruise and free housing texas us history book
SubredditDrama,not_removed,both of you tone it down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,doubly bizarre that my post is so far down the page saying that someone voting for someone solely on their sex shouldnt be a very controversial statement but lol srd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sure theres people doing that theres people that wanted to vote for cruz simply because hes an evangelical or pretends to be whatever theres people that voted both for and against romney specifically because hes a mormon theres people that will vote against clinton specifically because shes a woman but theres no one that will vote for clinton specifically because shes a woman no there are dont be silly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is no one doing that come on that is obviously not true just as you have people who refuse to vote for hillary because she is a woman there are others who will be more likely to vote for her as a woman i certainly know people who expressed opinions in the same vein asthis huffpo article titled of course its utterly absurd that most voters who vote for hillary do so because of gender but it is just as ridiculous to claim that no individual voters are more likely to support her because she is a woman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as others have pointed out to you im not saying anything like all women or even a majority im also voting for her if that helps so what is your opinion of the two seperate women who went on tv one said theres a special place in hell for women who dont support other women in relation to the hillarybernie primary another one was aghast that a women would support bernie over hillary and then said there are a lot of men at these bernie rallies so the women who go to them are probably just looking to meet men these two women seem to be making the case that you say never gets made you kept asking for proof in this thread this good enough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is no one doing that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah no one ever said otherwise i said right off the top that im a clinton voter but if someone is voting for her specifically because shes a woman than yeah thats pretty clearly sexist the op decided to freak out about it several posts of questionable sentence structure and i quite enjoyed reading them id encourage you to as well you dont particularly need to diagram the sentences to get them but it might help looking over the thread in general im not entirely sure shes not crying as she maniacally posts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no unless were willing to say theres a way to womansplain or foreignersplain or gaysplain but then theres a word for that condescend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i assume this was removed because the op was going hard on the comments but ya the title was neutral
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well and also thanks to her career long dedication to civil rights she polled higher among black voters than obama did during that primary season
SubredditDrama,not_removed,turnout was also higher for obama though in black turnout was and in it was
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no obama got far more of the black vote than kerry did not to mention turnout was far higher
SubredditDrama,not_removed,frequent srd posters disagree with me this is clearly a brigade
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im thinking more human instrumentality from evangelion but with somehow even more vagina imagery
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the mvm is one of the few things making me regret my penis the singularity will come but it wont come for me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah you probably should get a gyno i can recommend some
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for me its the point that there has been hundreds of millions of dollars and to investigate her for political reasons and the best thing they got was she wanted email on her phone while the it guy said she shouldnt some of the people before her did the same thing so she didnt see the big deal since there was already a precedent set if thats the best you got on a career politician after years of high profile and powerful jobs thats damn good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my take on it was that while it didnt result in anything it could have been catastrophic imagine if obama did this stuff during his presidency private email servers with confidential information accessing it over an unencrypted connection from china etc etc it would be a shitshow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if watergate was a what is an or
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you think the emails prove that bernie sanders has the nomination flat out stolen from him the vast majority of rpolitics really thinks this and i cant even be mad about it at this point its crossed some event horizon and its just fucking funny i mean dont get me wrong i still challenge them on it and say okay which emails prove this point them out but the humor of them en masse thinking this far outweighs anything else i can feel about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are no democrats who will be voting for trump that werent going to vote r regardless of the nominee anyway i agree with everything you said but this line trump has definitely inspired a rabid following from both sides of the spectrum the rthedonald people are evidence of that they like the man as a person and figurehead for many of not most of them it has nothing to do with party politics or any interest the the gop
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my dad is he worked in it for the first years of his career from hs dropout to programmer to management we were the first house in my neighborhood to have internet using netscape and altavista most of our neighbors would come by once a week or so for computer lessons and to see what this whole interwebs thing was about last week i showed him for the umpteenth time how to use uber hes still hesitant and doesnt quite understand it and im sure ill have to explain it to him again in a couple weeks i can only imagine how much worse he would be without his foundational knowledge in years when hes hrcs age
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im also a hillary supporter but i tooootally disagree shes way way more intelligent than youre giving her credit for while i support her platform and policies over trump she is arrogant with the server it was intentionally setup to avoid foia requests and with the whole dws debacle that was something orchestrated long ago shes not a perfect human and far from being an ideal or even honest politician but she is incredibly smart and knows exactly what shes doing as much as democrats hate the shit shes pulled rightfully so she is still the best hope we have at this point if you absolutely adored sanders like i did you should want to do as he wishes and continue to support the democratic party its the best weve got
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and you think thats acceptable for one of the most powerful people in the world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh bullshit they were clearly rigging the system in favor of her i dont know how anyone can deny that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,source id say having the former dnc chair step down leaving the position open for hillary campaign manager take his place while he is setup to be the vp for hillary and then dws resigns in a massive scandal only to be instantly offered the job with hillary as more than just a meanie email id like to see your counter sources do you stand by your claim that the only thing done was some mean emails
SubredditDrama,not_removed,source
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so why are we doing this drumpf thing again last time we made fun of a candidates name it was barack hussein obama and there was a heavy dose of racism behind it so why is it ok to call trump out of his name now its childish not any better than the obummer idiots from lsst election and adds nothing of substance to the list of reasons not to vote for him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and next election you can get a candidates worse than trump and worse than hillary lets just keep sliding right goering over himmler
SubredditDrama,not_removed,httpwwwtruthrevoltorgnewsflashbackaynrandshocksfemalecrowdiwouldnevervotewomanpresident
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is a throwaway two comments over a year ago in roldschoolcool and then nothing until today all of their other posts are in that submission its a dude trying to rile up shit because he ran out of shit to eat at home
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wish it were true that they only fucked with evolution
SubredditDrama,not_removed,why are you deleting the comments
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people voting for someone because their evangelical means that they are voting for someone who likely shares their beliefs you cannot honestly compare the idea people just voting their gender and people voting for someone who is going to protect the rights of their gender to have things like abortions to call it the same thing it is really fucking insulting
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes an evangelical or pretends to be whatever say what you will about ted cruz but the man believes what he says apparently hes a very nice person too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes of course there are people who vote for her because shes a woman but its most likely a very small insignificant minority and that minority probably would vote for her anyway no matter if shes a woman or not instead of trump honestly do you think that clinton would lose a significant amount of voters if she were a man i personally think that it would be the other way around there are probably more people not voting for her because shes a woman than people only voting for her because shes a woman its basically a nonissue
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the argument then says because of her beliefs not her vagina see the difference
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and what exactly are the entitled sexists saying itt so far its just been people pointing out that there are almost certainly a few people out there who will vote for hillary solely due to her gender and that is sexist no one has said its a large number of people no one has said it applies to all hillary voters hell the only person ive seen imply that only women will vote for hillary due to her gender has been op all ive seen is people get irritated at op when they fail to grasp this incredibly simple point and insteas argue against statements no one itt has made so tell me does that qualify as entitled sexism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im just saying its a useless criticism the people who are voting for that reason are either not going to care not read your post or not understand nor agree with you its like when people point out that voting for trump because hes an outsider is stupid since hes essentially the establishment incarnate they dont care nor agree
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love how this is already under the filter this is a drama subreddit where people get upset at people laughing at dumbshit like mansplain does this sub also nonironically use manspread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what mansplain means condescend because you know better than a dumb girl
SubredditDrama,not_removed,patronizing is pretty much quite literally mansplaining the use of the root patron isnt by accident
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not averse to any of those suggestions theyre all specific subtypes of condescension gaysplaining would be when a gay person explains some facet of being straight to a straight person condescendingly assuming a straight person couldnt possibly have figured that same thing out for themselves the pervasive heteronormativity of society disproportionate ratio of straight to gay people and general lack of a consistent overarching straight culture make such a scenario hard to imagine but i dont think its necessarily impossible that such a thing could happen theres nothing wrong with being specific mansplaining is just a particular form of gendered condescension that was prevalent enough that some people named it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no one is voting for her just because shes a woman its a strawman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,weve had plenty of threads with drama in the comments is the only reason this one got hit because op was one of the ones arguing that seems like a dumb reason and an unenforceable standard definitely not worth nuking the thread at least
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how many lines did you do today relax srd mods arent going to determine the results of the general election this is not as big of deal as you think it is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair the clintons have huge name recognition in the black community that obama didnt in the primary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good point no matter how much the white dudes on my facebook try to act like the misguided crime bills of the will hurt her and kaine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that would require some sort of mythical artist like the h r giger of vagine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think you can fit any more vaginas into one show
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is this a reference
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well bush did it while he was in office and no one really gave a fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you mean like bush did during his presidency you did know that happened right
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that parallel dimension should definitely not vote for clinton
SubredditDrama,not_removed,something like a murder coverup or coup something that threatens to actually end the government
SubredditDrama,not_removed,president bartlett no disclosing his multiple sclerosis is an
SubredditDrama,not_removed,would probably be something like a full blown violent coup
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a would be if a sitting president cabinet member congressman or scotus justice was proven to be involved in something heinous like the murder of a political rival massive embezzlement of public funds might be an or depending on severity or evidence of collusion with a foreign power to work against the united states nothing surrounding hillary has even gotten past a imo and im not a big fan of the hildog still voting for her but yknow not much choice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i guess selling nukes on the black market i agree the email scandal is a three but watergate is at least a
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think most of the people getting livid about are probably young and new to politics i get it i have been there ill be the first to admit i am way more cynical and jaded than i was years ago and i admire the passion you need to still get mad about this stuff its not them getting mad that i find weird though its that they are completely oblivious to the fact that no one else cares they have deluded themselves into thinking everyone agrees with them and its going to matter because they got a couple hundred upvotes on an arrest hillary comment in a circlejerk thread i dont ever remember being that tuned out when i was young and angry it was partly because i saw no one else was i was never under the impression that we young angry kids were going to take over the world i dont know maybe i am just a little envious of their naivety and i am just becoming a grumpy old fart
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am sure there are a handful of people out there who are d but voting trump because trump but i dont buy that they amount to a statistically meaningful number of voters any large number of democrats voting trump out there would have voted cruz or jeb and would not have voted bernie the identity of the candidate has no effect on their decision i am aware that a number of people on reddit claim they regularly vote democrat and will be voting trump i frankly dont believe them maybe one or two really feel that way but the narrative that trump specifically is sapping democrats that would normally support the democratic platform andor who would have supported sanders isnt believable to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel the same way im voting for her even though i was big on sanders but the whole email things was pretty bad
SubredditDrama,not_removed,knows exactly what shes doing sure thing marco
SubredditDrama,not_removed,smart doesnt mean proficient in all disciplines shes wicked smart but id never ask her to fix my computer because i know she doesnt know anything about computers just like shed never ask me to write policy papers because i wouldnt know where to begin or how to do it likely what happened was youre right she didnt want her emails susceptible to foia requests but not for some nefarious purpose shes been attacked for most of her life by political opponents and shes gunshy im not excusing her im just being realistic shes not an evil person so she tells her staff this and they get someone they know to set this server up for her the deal is done shes not involved in any of the technical details she just wants it to be so and people do it for her im assuming shes learned a lesson now and wont do something so stupid again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the state department should have had better policies the white house does well at least now under bush all email was on the rnc server and they deleted million of them when subpoenaed top attorneys were fired
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its certainly not as big a deal as reddit seems to believe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rigging like making millions of more people vote for her the worst you have is that someone spoke about maybe criticizing his religion but then no one did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dws wouldnt step down till obama himself called to talk her down her honorary chairman direct quote title reeks of bone throwing to get her to resign without a bigger public spectacle
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he stepped down to run for senate you guys do know that right youre right mods this post was biased against sexism thank you for banning me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh shit they used bold everyone change their opinions now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you dont need a counter source when youre the one supporting the common fact youre the one making a claim so youre the one that needs a source
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am not arguing your point i just am trying to figure out who the fuck is election justice usa the who we are on their website basically says we are a collection of people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,while he is setup to be the vp for hillary let me just tackle this one you do realize kaine backed obama in right and it was a huge blow against hillarys chances having a young influential democrat like him back her challenger and that it was obama who wanted him for dnc chair since he couldnt run for another position in virginia but was also obamas vp runnerup so to summarize clinton was demanding that obama put one of his own top backers who helped him defeat her in into a position that made sense for him so that she could in turn pick him for vp eight years down the line regardless of whether he ran for and won a senate election several years down the line i think ill stick to occams razor obama like kaine suggested him for a position while he waited for another election in virginia and clinton liked his resume eight years later
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay youre just a parody of yourself at this point if someone links a google doc that says thats not election fraud is that a source
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well its a different scenario the origin is that trump has criticized other people in the past for changing their last names to sound less foreign while ignoring the fact that his own family did the same so it is rooted more in trumps bullying and hypocrisy than in racism for one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because its an ebin jon oliver maymay silly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love the idea that what ayn rand said support the claim that men are voting with their dicks the gallup poll is encouraging isnt it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre right i was looking in this thread for a totesmeta link and didnt see one still doesnt change the fact that youve got an out of control persecution complex this isnt an evil brigade you are being very unreasonable
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then why didnt they vote for him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre both acting like jerks right now dont act like jerks and all will be well do your best to engage in conversation in a civil way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,can you unfuck that sentence please the point is yes people do vote or not vote for people based upon single identity issues are you honestly entertaining the idea that some people will not vote for clinton based specifically on her gender but that no one will vote for her based upon the same this is bordering on surreal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is what feminists actually believe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no ones saying shes gaining lots of votes because shes a woman but to say that theres no one voting for her because of gender is frankly insane
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay im just responding to the title can i do that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,did you even look at the article the author quite literally argues for voting for hillary just on the basis that she is a woman but if you are a woman living in america and you truly dislike both options you have for president your option is not to not vote you dont have to love everything about hillary clinton to be inspired watching history be made your option is the woman its ok for your option to be the woman you side with your side you side with the notion that young girls will grow up saying they want to be the next woman president again i am certainly not saying that such views are at all representative of hillary voters however unfortunately there are definitely people on both sides who have put quite a bit of emphasis on gender during this election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats srdd not drama friend
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honey the bot doesnt respond
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nothing in that srdd thread or the drama thread would imply butthurt theres like comments total between them are you a novelty account your username seems relevant here because its describing you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,duh of course it does dont mansplain here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,isnt this entire subreddit useless criticism like im not sure what to say i read the title of this thread i perused the drama thread and i said yeah a woman voting for a woman due to their gender actually is sexist should i not have done that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,considering all my comments in this thread are fluctuating between and points id say this sub has a decent number of people on both sides with a slight sjw bias
SubredditDrama,not_removed,meta reddit where divisive language is bad sometimes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ooh now thats an etymology im interested in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gaysplaining would be when a gay person explains some facet of being straight to a straight person condescendingly assuming a straight person couldnt possibly have figured that same thing out for themselves httpsbroadlyvicecomenusarticlestraightpeopledontexistnewresearchsaysutmsourcevicefbca
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gaysplaining would be when a straight person explains some facet of being gay to a gay person condescendingly assuming a gay person couldnt possibly have figured something out for themselves wouldnt that be straightsplaining theres nothing wrong with being specific except when the specificity is just silly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,strawwoman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really no one like i think we all agree that the majority of people voting for hillary are doing so because of her politics people in general arent choosing to vote for her just because shes a woman but you cant say that nobody is voting for her because shes a woman there are over million people in the us odds are some of those people will vote for her because shes a woman not all not most not a lot of people but a few will can you not agree to that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know but it was amazing how much of a train wreck the comment section turned into
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the crime bill thing is funny because there was a significant amount of support for the bill from black leaders at the time including the congressional black caucus iirc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,amazingly people sometimes post in multiple subs hell they may even participate in several subs that have a similar base concept quite shocking i know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,combine hr giger and georgia okeefe
SubredditDrama,not_removed,h r vaginer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there is always room for more vag always
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wasnt aware of this before my time i cant speak for everyone but i wouldve given a fuck
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be honest no i didnt that was before my time now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so we should ignore her across just because they didnt go as bad as they couldve this time what about next time she does this shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most of the mean girls type stuff seems like shut youd find in any office email server people are mean over email
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its that they are completely oblivious to the fact that no one else cares i think even more than that they seem incapable of either understanding or trying to understand why everyone else doesnt care pointing out out that hillary was only indirectly involved in the email gets ignored i havent read every email but im yet to see any of the incriminating emails people usually bring up directly connected to her pointing out that most of the emails were sent when bernie was well beyond the point that most primary runnersup drop out gets shouted down pointing out that theres no tangible change that resulted from anything discussed gets met with conspiracy theories about hacking voting machines or such and so on somehow the only accetable view is that everything leaked was a smoking gun that the ignorant masses are ignoring and all views not agreeing with this point can only be the result of shills
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably young and new to politics i think thats always a mistake people make obviously that was not the case for the bernie or bust people at the convention the left has its feels before reals people too the only way bernie could have lost was corruption to them no way people just like hillary more it just feels easier to blame someone else that is a very strong narrative that is happening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant say whether its statistically significant either however i do know true democrats that have fallen under the thrall of trump they didnt or couldnt like hillary and thought sanders was a joke mostly its democrats that have soured on the partys foreign policy i find myself even tempted by trump in that regard but i think the guy is all talk and will do far more harm than good
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the state department should have had better policies she was head of the state department and made the executive decision to host emails on a private server if we go off the excuse that shes an old person who doesnt understand technology i would then question why someone with such power was making decisions on things she did not understand and then lie to the public about it for over a year after being caught
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ignoring the rest of reddit as someone who works in it yes there werent really any drastic repercussions that said i see what could have happened and thats why i have a problem with the situation the worst part is that she acts like it was nothing i would have a lot more respect for her if she just said im sorry i fucked up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i for one am shocked to learn that party insiders have opinions on whom would be the best candidate to put forward in the general election furthermore i am scandalized to learn theyd try to favor the candidate whos loyally worked for the betterment of the party for decades over the candidate who only joined last year in order to take advantage of a party infrastructure he had never contributed to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id be happy to answer your question when you answer mine do you stand by your claim that the only thing done was some mean emails also this would be nice id like to see your counter sources i do like how you ignored the request for sources and the question
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre trying to spin him stepping down to run for office as scandal its all over the donald
SubredditDrama,not_removed,weve been called out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i provided one literally at the top if it is a common fact a source should be easy to come by so i await for your source to counter you dont need a counter source when youre the one supporting the common fact youre the one making a claim so youre the one that needs a source
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the same type of people as elizabeth beck shes the far left version of orly taitz she sued donald and had to pay him when she thought it was rude that he told her not to pump breastmilk in a deposition for another nuisance lawsuit that had been thrown out shes now trying to sue the dnc under class action since class actions cant take upfront legal fees she set up a super pac to get money to fund her and her husbands efforts since its a superpac they dont have any recourse if she rips them off
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah but dude he has a google doc from some website and all youre doing is stating easily verifiable facts
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its even stupider because id like jon oliver to show me a single nonanglo white person whose relatives immigrated here in the early who doesnt have an anglicized name its just what happened back then trumps real name being drumpf isnt any funnier than my fathers name being strong instead of stark kinda mad about that actually we could have sounded like iron man and instead we sound like mormons and more importantly i think it takes away from attention to trumps real faults because having a silly name isnt one of them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that now only or so wont vote for a woman i mean i guess its better than but not its not great also ayn rand has male followers not many female
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump didnt help the working class but many of his voters were the african american community in particular had strong rational reasons to vote for clinton that doesnt mean shes in their best interest their legitimate concerns have been funneled into support of corporate oligarchy its hard to dissuade the aa community from trusting an entity that has given them concessions for generations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,both of you tone it down
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not op but i didnt think that they meant it literally
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah voting for someone who is pro woman is about her beliefs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn my subaverage trump supporting penis its made me mansplain yet again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nobody should have done anything ever
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sure i could see someone making such an argument against that article
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre right i got it mixed up but obviously you get my point language is descriptivist and people creating more specific words just lets them present specific concepts more concisely i feel like the overarching point youre trying to make is that if mansplaining exists then womansplaining does too and i agree with you it does at least in theory in practice its much less common because in western society theres much less institutional sexism driving women to condescend to men because of their gender than the other way around that doesnt mean it cant or doesnt happen only that its less common and hence womansplaining is rightfully lessdiscussed its exactly like misogyny vs misandry obviously you can be sexist against men but the historical background of the societies we live in means that sexism against women is more prevalent and more institutionalized and hence misogyny is talked about a hell of a lot more
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all straw lives matter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh i dont think it was for political reasons i do think the mods sometimes try and lean too hard into their attempts to make the sub appear totally neutral though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hr georgia ogiger master of vagine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,geiger mixed with a bit of dali and some picasso for some spice also instead of dali throw in a wee bit of van gogh when one is feeling down bam
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vincent vag jina
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you implying that i insulted him because i didnt and for reference i had no clue about bush doing the same thing it was before my time but i wouldve condemned him just as much for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,search bush email scandal it makes the clinton one look so tame that youll never see it as a big deal again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,call me an optimist but i dont think after all this shit she went through she will be sending emails from a private server while in the white house
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when i am elected we will construct a crossdimensional device and we will hold negahillary responsible for her hypothetical misdeeds akkmed for all possible americas
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i havent met any people irl who feel that way but i am sure they exist in greater numbers than even just your experience i most ly just dont believe the thedonald posters who claim to be that or claim that thousands of people feel that way but i dont believe most of what they say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yupp and the rules are not made by the sec of state that isnt how it works you should watch comeys testimony
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she did she couldnt say that before the fbi investigation concluded though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i see what could have happened what like the server being hacked by russia because that did happen to the server she was supposed to be using
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah they supported the party member in fact many democrats want to sue the dnc for letting bernie any party money and they have cause
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes the only thing that was done was mean emails
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wait which part of this comment is important you could at least use some italics got damn
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a google drive document is not a source if it in itself has no sources
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also thats just the people who are consciously picking based on gender and willing to admit it id bet subconscious biases make that number a lot higher even though theyre almost impossible to test or separate out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the last poll is pretty old but it tell us that only of americans wouldnt vote for a woman at that time i agree its too much but if your compare with the answers in or in i think that encouraging is appropriate in any case there isnt any logical link between this facts and it is like statistically proven that men are voting with their dicks which is a wrong and inflammatory statement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so theyre naieve and you know whats best for them thats some condescending bullshit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes insulting me as are a number of others i cant seem to get any recourse though except to be threatened by mods for not remaining totally complicit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you sure do have a lot of faith in how informed that voting populace is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im voting for her i already said that but yes some people are voting for her specifically because shes a woman you cant deny that any more than you can deny that some people arent voting for her specifically because shes a woman that was a great sentence by the way it sorta read like you printed that out fed it to your dog the dog threw it up and you pieced it back together haphazardly the puke remnants covered up any commas
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the punctuation fairy has not been kind to you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how can you honestly say that out of everyone voting for hilary not one of them is doing so based purely on the fact that shes a women there are a lot of stupid people out there
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you read some more of ops comments on this post i think youll find that she absolutely does mean that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the title says women that voting for a woman due to their gender is sexist and i said yeah thats true youre saying theres not many of them and i agree but that doesnt change that yes if youre voting for her specifically because shes a woman then yes thats sexist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,damn you are one stubborndumb bastard its the worst combination
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol dude chill the fuck out some people are voting for hillary because of her gender some others are not voting for her because of her gender its happening but it isnt an big issue thats all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wrong bot thats srdd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in practice its much less common because in western society theres much less institutional sexism driving women to condescend to men because of their gender than the other way around this is how i know youve never been a married man or a guy who has a livein girlfriend but my point is the word is completely unnecessary like lets call crime whitecrime and blackcrime based on who does it hispanicrime rolls off the tongue lets use that too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im afraid to google dripping wet xenomorph for a relevant gif
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the idiocy of the past may dwarf the idiocy of the present but it in no way negates it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,except just because someone else did something that was worse doesnt mean that this wasnt bad if it wasnt discovered that she was doing this then she would have done it if she is president
SubredditDrama,not_removed,her misdeeds arent hypothetical she did fuck up the results just couldve been way worse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the inspector generals office noted that none of the incidents were reported to state department security officials despite the fact that official policies call for reporting improper cybersecurity practices
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really i mustve missed this do you have a source im curious and lazy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my point being that as bad as it was it couldve been worse
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sources to answer your question i was aware of the senator run but also aware you can make promises in the future another exchange involves a discussion on whether to move maryland ophthalmologist sreedhar potarazu from sitting beside president barack obama at a dnc event after national finance director jordan kaplan said he gave less money than philip munger another donor it would be nice to take care of him from the dnc side kaplan wrote referring to munger source sounds like more than just mean emails theres no need to lie its just the internet theres no need to get so upset
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i am waiting for your common source let me count the sources in your comment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you can see in my comment i said theyre not naive ultimately any political opinion boils down to others are wrong so dont throw that bullshit at me or are you being condescending and superior to trump supporters they have rational and logical reasons to vote hillary i am an anticapitalist so i believe hillary is not going to be in their best interest thats not condescending thats how opinions work ever heard of that word opinions
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre both acting like jerks right now dont act like jerks and all will be well do your best to engage in conversation in a civil way
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i do not give one flying fuck what i do care about is the lies being told about women voters in this country when there is a very real issue with male voters doing exactly what people are accusing women of more than say that they will never vote for a woman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how can i honestly say youre making a claim without proof and blaming all suporters for it donald said mexicans were rapists the fact that one mexican may be a rapist make that statement true or does it make it really insulting still
SubredditDrama,not_removed,okay yeah thats true nevermind then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i can see it being a sore spot though its been used to discredit her supporters for years and years but yes it definitely happens
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this guy doesnt need ur fax
SubredditDrama,not_removed,cut out the grandstanding please thanks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jabs about my sex life aside words are only meaningful inasmuch as they can convey the intent of the author when someone uses the word mansplaining while describing something theyre imparting a huge amount of context about how the nature of conscious or subconscious gender bias affects the situation in question if you understand that context then its basically packing in several extra sentences into one word relative to just saying condescending its efficient as hell if you want to talk about blackcrime vs whitecrime then be my guest again most linguists are descriptivists so theyre not going to tell you not to invent new words if the words youre using catch on within a community then theyll acquire a similar level of contextual baggage that will allow you to communicate complex concepts in single words the concepts youre communicating might be dogwhistley but hey
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not that i think that this is some great example of foresight on her part nor does it pardon her of the action but we have two scenarios a she uses the home server and could have been hacked b she uses the state department server and she would have been hacked i dont see how it could have been worse than what would have happened had she used the state departments server
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the dnc exists to get democrats into office not whatever wahoo who has a cult following
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is that election fraud
SubredditDrama,not_removed,answer his question bold is that voter fraud
SubredditDrama,not_removed,whoa whoa whoa hang on there can i get a source about the number of sources in that guys comment
SubredditDrama,not_removed,again im not trying to prove a point one way or the other here im not the person you were arguing with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,as for civil the dozen or so drama members who are commenting here with insults can you do something theres only so many times you report them before you get baited into replying oh no you just had me banned for being biased by posting the title
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how am i acting like a jerk these guys are following all of my comments and repeatedly insulting me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the few people that are indeed voting for her specifically because shes a woman sure ill belittle them thats okay theres not many anyway what are they gonna do to me
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think youre getting a little too hot in this pointing out that some people will vote for her because shes a womana pretty small number isnt defaming all clinton voters its acknowledging that for some people men and women minor singular issues are how they decide things its not sexist to point out a minority of people are silly thats why were here after all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,goddamn op you are waaaaay too involved in this drama is this an alt of one of the accounts in the linked thread
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those are very valid concerns and i dont think anyone in this thread is disagreeing with you about that what uitsaboyffxiv was trying to get across to you is that just as there are people who would not vote for someone because they were a woman more than by your reckoning there are also people who would only vote for someone because they were a woman given the first logically the second has to follow and thats all that uitsaboyffxiv was trying to say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,who denied that trump voters are voting with their dicks i must have missed that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not saying all hilary voters are voting for hilary because shes a women im saying its not true that there isnt one person whos doing that i remember seeing a video on reddit a few months back going around and basically asking people this exact question and there was a surprising amount of people who said theyd vote for hilary because shes a women now you can argue theyll have other reasons as well but so say that no one is doing that is just wrong i managed to find a similar video to the one i mentioned granted its not as good and its from a right wing guy who im guessing wont be voting for her the editing looks like hes cherry picking but he gets these types of responses
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if a woman were president there would be far less war a shallow sentiment echoed for decades shallow facile people exist and vote true fax
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont have a fax machine gramps p
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ok this is your final warning stop attacking other users or ima put you in time out its not ok for you to receive insults and any rule breakers will have their comments removed and will be warned however all ive seen so far in this thread is you antagonising people youve been warned for this stuff before now i understand and respect that you feel very passionate about the topic of people not voting for a presidential candidate just because she is a woman but you need to be respectful towards others otherwise there is no chance for a civil discourse i hope you can understand this thanks and if you spot anyone being a jackass please report them they will be punished
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ill knock it off sorry
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol thats not a jab but if you think women arent often condescending when you live with them about a great deal of things around the house i dont know what to tell you theres a whole trope about it ya know the concepts youre communicating might be dogwhistley but hey ding ding ding if youre using mansplaining you might be trying to convey a lot more things than youre aware of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you squint really really hard no its still not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well go through and remove the comments that break the rules that takes time but were working on it theres only so many times you report them before you get baited into replying this is untrue and its exactly why you needed a time out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow i see youve already been warned okay since youve been warned and chose to ignore it and youre not seeing clearly that you are being hostile literally all over this thread you need a time out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh really there are front page posts calling donald and sanders voters sexists who vote with their dick
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kek
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hold on he says drama posters are the worst i agreed how is that too mean youve left up all the comments insulting me personally
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no worries have a good one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if mansplaining was the same as condescending then id agree with you that its a superfluous word but its not men can condescend to women without mansplaining women can condescend to men without womansplaining im not by any means saying that women cant or dont condescend to men im saying that men more frequently explain concepts condescendingly to women in the process assuming a general lack of understanding of said concept predicated solely on the fact that the person theyre explaining it to is female than vice versa a trend that displays the subconscious effects of hundreds of years of sexist societal trends that pervade even our comparatively egalitarian modern culture thats what i mean by mansplaining and its quite a mouthful which is why im glad i can wrap it all up into one convenient word
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he was an independent until running for president and hes already left the democratic party even after saying that he was going to stand in future elections as a democrat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes been an independent pretty much his whole career until the election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he was independent until
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he was an independent for years despite the democrats urging him to become one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he didnt officially change party either the democrats just let him run for the party
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he actually didnt officially join the party at all hes still i
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think rlegaladvice specifically has a no you cant run anyone over link in their sidebar now its weird how many people think its ok to a run annoying people over or b poison annoying people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the op of the comment is such a jerk we should bombard his inbox with nudes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for some reason im picturing that cockmonger guy is a real life walter sobchak
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just commented on dumb shit as i encountered it are we recruiting for new shitposters in srd id better get a finders fee dickbutt mods
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yea we should lemme find some videos of fat neckbeards fucking fleshlights
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im calmer than you are
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if youll kindly send me that as wellresearch yada yada daddy please
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hey tangentialthreat thank you for your submission unfortunately it has been removed from rsubredditdrama because this post is not appropriate for srd please read our rules before posting here again for more on our rules please check out our httpswwwredditcomrsubredditdramawikirules if you have any questions or concerns about this removal feel free to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he is going to push hillary in hahahahahahahahahahaha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do any of these people even know what the dnc chair does theyre attributing an incredible amount of power to a position that honestly barely fucking matters outside of fundraising for the democratic party its astonishing how mad they are just because someone bernie didnt endorse won
SubredditDrama,not_removed,guy wins position guy immediately appoints bernies candidate as deputy chair literally within minutes bernie supporters still flip their shit about the establishmentshillsetc ah never change reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the one thing that irks me about people bitching about shills and correcting the record is if this shill army is so clearly saying things that arent true or substantiated why isnt it easy to just refute their unsubstantiated positions or whatever idk i personally would love to debate an actual shill i feel like it should be so easy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i havent yet done too much research into the guy but from what i have read he seems pretty good with a solid track record of defending civil rights and fighting for consumer protections do they just want the absolute most perfect candidate or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh man that thread no but the rules are rigged against us earlier today they forcefully voted down a resolution that would have reimposed the obamaera ban on corporate donations and lobbyist appointments within the dnc im pretty sure they voted it down with the same amount of force as any democratic institution votes on any resolution but losing isnt the same thing as it was rigged it just means you lost does that mean bernies handpicked candidate had an even chance not really because bernie and his supporters joined all of fifteen minutes ago and have been alltooeager to remind us that theyre not really democrats and that we cant count on them at all if it surprises someone that i joined the democrats for two months so i could vote for bernie and now am an independent doesnt earn you much sway with the democratic party im not sure what to say until we are countable and a real united political force there is no chance of concession by the political establishment the problem is that you dont want concessions you want capitulation concession is bernie getting a third of the platform committee concession is adopting his policies concession is giving ellison the secondincommand position to the one he wanted capitulation is what these guys are looking for an admission that were wrong and theyre right and that we will now submit to their will and follow their dictates our government belongs to all of us and not just a handful of campaign contributors it does belong to us and since you guys managed to help get trump into office his government belongs to you as well show up to meetings for your county and precinct committees run for positions of influence and apply pressure to perez to extend real reforms if he wants our votes an end of superdelegates or proportional superdelegate allocation primaries open to independents and sameday registration its funny that they think of those things as somehow universal goods which the dnc hasnt done solely because the establishment doesnt want it im nothing but a rankandfile democrat and i dont want those things well actually i dont give a damn about superdelegates but i definitely dont want independents voting for the democratic nominee much less that people be allowed to change party affiliation for one day to be able to exert influence over my partys nominee want to know how bernie round loses my vote by winning through an insurgency of independent or sameday registering voters who were not democrats beforehand because thats not my party anymore thats a coup so look take the day be pissed off im pissed off too but come back tomorrow and start working yeah be pissed off that a party you arent really a member of chose someone it liked instead of someone chosen by a former primary candidate who spent years attacking us and joined only to try to run for president using our name im sure that once again throwing a petulant tantrum will win over more support maybe instead of expecting people to be obedient sheep the party should consider electing leadership that listens to the people im usually not a fan of horseshoe theory but there is something similar about the mindset of the farleft and farright in that both claim to speak for a silent majority who obviously agree with them and are speaking out because the only voices they hear are from people who agree with them except for the shills of course
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the bernie brigade at least the part on reddit seems a lot like the tea party just on the completely different end of the spectrum at the very least theyre as vocal about not getting their way as the tea party
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i like how theyre calling for making their own party as if that will help get them a liberal president
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i literally just argued with a couple of idiots in rprogressive about this i mean like jesus how are you gonna call yourself a progressive but yet you are willing to give up on a party just because some of the people who run it some its candidates dont agree with your ideals do these people know what happens when a really left leaning party is able to excite the base but dont appeal to average voters the uk labor party happens because corbyn the leader of labor is unable to get his party in line and form a credible opposition to the conservatives the ruling party it lost a historic byelection not even two days ago in copeland which was a safe labor seat for almost a century these people seriously need to get a grip enough people literally thought hillary was no better than trump because shes supposedly a corporate democrat whatever the fuck that means and now were stuck with a borderline authoritarian administration hell bent of destroying everything that democrats whether they be blue dogs or berniecrats hold dear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the real drama is always at srd eh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ellison is now deputy chairman and will maintain his position in congress as a bernie supporter i think this works better than if ellison actually won
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its funny watching them get ticked off but its also kind of sad because in reality theyll just go back to not voting for the next few elections thats obviously against their own interests since the liberal youth vote is a huge part of the democratic partys core but trust me your average progressive will give up and say fuck it we lost politics is boring now sooner than theyll make serious efforts to change the party from within
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kind of nice to know that in this era of trump and his supporters we can still rely on sanders supporters being dumb too granted i prefer their dumb over trump supporter dumb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i always have to remind myself is still up and running for some reason
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sad that the democrats decided to ignore the lessons of november by picking debbie wassermanperez to be their new chairman lol how is rpolitics making this claim all they did after the election is become trump news and refuse to even entertain discussion of the problems on the left edit oops looks like that comment was astroturfing by a trumplet my bad everyone
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and this is why fucking trump won liberals are all busy fighting each other over how corrupt the dnc is isnt that they dont care that donald fucking trump won god i hate these idiots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well fuck this next election ill be voting for david duke because the democrats didnt pick exactly the right person i wanted
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a good thing he party is uniting and not letting isealogical purity ruin them again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bernie losing beyond the grave the movement still has a chance guise
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont want to put too fine a point on it but bernie bros are the stupidest fucking morons on the internet literally
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he still got the vice chair under perez i expect him to still be very much influential for the following years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,blatant corruption in what fucking way is being voted into a position considered blatant corruption what the fuck it would only be blatant corruption if you won the position just because you created it what kind of fucking logic says that being voted in is corruption
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i commented on two posts in the rpolitics new feed and immediately got called an astroturfer and paid shill sure this month old account with thousands of karma is astroturfing jesus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,congrats to those who are leaving the party you will now have no say in what happens in the democratic party its not like they did anyway repeated ad nauseum inthread already yes and throwing away your say because an election didnt go your way is not the way to change things oh the irony
SubredditDrama,not_removed,political groups of all types online are cancer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ellison would have been the wrong choice sanders would have ensured the party had life going forward the party is certainly breathing its last breaths
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so rpolitics is the only people that have a problem here
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this just shows how unreasonable bernie progressives can be if they dont get what they want they cry about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til rsandersforpresident is still around and still active
SubredditDrama,not_removed,is hillary even doing anything besides the occasional snarky tweet and becoming lady grey of the chippaqua squirrels it seems shes mostly stepped aside from politics other than offering encouragement to antitrump protestors and what not which most major democrats would encourage because duh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i love how they ignore that perez is obamas candidate not hillarys is obama dog meat to them now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would think after losing to donald trump you would immediately be exiled from all politics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have to say though most of the responses to even reasonably opposed responses were much more passifying and forward looking than what i had gotten accustomed to during the election from that sub
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not even that but perez immediately installed ellison as whats basically his curious how bernies endorsement for ellison is so often cited as a reason for progressives to support him but during the election that actually mattered last year a similar endorsement just wasnt good enough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,perez nominated ellison as deputy chair perez was a respected secretary of labor and former civil rights lawyer at the department of justice he is as progressive as they come the language in there is interesting there are a lot of claims that if they took over the party the clinton people ie the moderates and centrists and the people who vote for them would just fall in line you only need to look at the performance of jeremy corbyn and the british labour party to see how precarious that assumption is then again people in that sub think that primarying joe manchin in west virginia is a good idea because he is too conservative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think that part of it is because bernie also seemed to put a ton of stock into for some reason as far as i can tell most people involved didnt want to cast the race in an establishment vs progressive light during the debates the candidates seemed to emphasize above all else that theyre all friends and they all generally agree with each other perez and ellison didnt seem like they wanted this to be a berniehillary proxy war as far as i can tell hillary didnt even really comment on it shes just wandering in upstate ny somewhere tweeting snarky oneliners at trump it really seems like bernie and his supporters are the only ones who took a hardline stance on this forreasons
SubredditDrama,not_removed,when the sanders mania was in full tilt i had a conversation with a fellow hilary delegate at my district caucus about how while its nice to see people engaging in the political process many of the bernie supporters seemed to have no idea how the system even worked while the district chair was going over the rules and announcing that both campaigns had agreed on a rule change two weeks prior regarding selection of alternates at the caucus a very angry man wearing a fedora sari and bernie tshirt attempted to use his very thin understanding of the procedures to stop the rule change this lead to the chair attempting to explain how the rule had already changed within the bylaws of the caucus and was agreed upon by both campaigns it was insanity
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a glorified fundraiser position can anyone even name a recent dnc chair off the top of their head besides dws most wouldnt know about her without the controversies i bet and howard dean because of his state strategy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do any of these people even know what the dnc chair does not really all they know is that the dnc chair and dws such a convenient bitesized name isnt it became a bogey man they could direct their anger toward
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you have to remember these folks think dws literally picked clinton to win so from that viewpoint they do think the dnc chair has a lot of power
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i blame the media mostly cnn blowing this out of proportion they had a big debate like this was a presidential primary with a countdown clock and analysis and everything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but dude how could i support the dnc if the man raising money for the party is not progressive enough how could i look myself in the mirror
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how dare you as a moderator over on rdebbieforpresident ill have you know that the dnc chair is the most important position
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the valid criticism ive seen is not on the political positions per say but rather the operational model simply put the fear is that perez who only ever won one elected position a county council seat in a dc suburb is just going to maintain the status quo beltwayfocused strategy thats seen the party hemorrhage seats in state legislatures and governors mansions in the last decade whereas ellison knows how to win in the midwest
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously bernies going to have to be careful with his influence over this group of people they have a lot of energy but theyre not graceful losers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theyre attributing an incredible amount of power to a position that honestly barely fucking matters outside of fundraising for the democratic party your overall point is spot on but one meaningful criticism of the dnc for the last cycles is that they havent been allocating enough resources to statelevel races with any luck they will have a lot more money and bodies to distribute and hopefully will get their shit together at the state level in more states precisely because the democratic party in many states is atrophied or a club for the folks with job security because of how gerrymandering works were going to need leadership and training from the national party to reform and rejuvenate the statelevel democratic party in a lot of states
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bernie endorsed clinton and they didnt listen so why start making sense now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those subs are baited and led by td concern trolls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,personally im angry that the establishment couldnt even give the left this small concession ellison announced his candidacy immediately perez didnt until they were looking for someone to challenge him you say people are mad only because its not bernies guy the only reason perez ran was so it wouldnt be bernies guy and the islamaphobic smear campaign they ran against ellison the center did everything possible to paint him as an antisemite no this isnt huge but it could be the straw that breaks the camels back another middle finger to the left which has been organizing the majority of these antitrump rallies now theres cries of party unity if you criticize the dems corporate interests you want trump to succeed ellisons district has had incredible turn out over his time there and minnesota stayed democratic despite the crumbling blue wall not to mention he clearly has his finger on the countrys political pulse the democratic party has given nothing to the left and still expects unconditional support i dont blame people for being fed up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that gary ruppert guy does it all the time doesnt even try to hide it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that is fucking hilarious though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly the most revealing thing is the usage of violent metaphors attributing the loss to a personal attack every time bernie lost or someone they liked endorsed hillary it was a slap in the face or twisting the knife
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah this kind of drama reminds me why i blocked before the donald became shitpost central i had already forgotten how obnoxious they were back then
SubredditDrama,not_removed,any place where people dont have to worry about being accountable is gonna turn out the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not on either side but based on explanations ive seen the reason why bernie supporters arent happy is because the deputy chair position has no power it was a position previously held by tulsi gabbard who spoke up and was then disinvited from meetings by dws so as far as bernie supporters are concerned its just pat on the head but nothing changes let me know if im wrong i would gladly like to hear more and better my understanding
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these are the same people who ignored that aidanking or whatever his name was a paid bernie staffer on reddit controlling and all that spammy bs that clogged the site bernie invested a fuckton in viralsocial media compared to hillary and the bernie mania died down pretty quickly it was either a fad or there was a lot of work from what others refer to as shills i think the shill thing is hillarious because there is just as much in my opinion more of a likelihood that trump and bernie camps had more shills online the only difference is that trump supporters and bernie supporters joined together in their hate campaign and hillarys side didnt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honestly because it gets old even for legitimate people who are misinformed on issues like free trade theres a point where its not even worth it to type out the same response to a person who may or may not be willing to reconsider their stances
SubredditDrama,not_removed,please debate all the trump supporters then theyre just like that but probably not paid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes they wanted bernie or as a second best bernies personal pick because its much easier to just defer to bernies judgment rather than entertain any other ideas that might come from somewhere else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they honestly dont even know who perez is nor the relative strengths and weaknesses of each candidate all they know is that bernie made an endorsement in terms of issues theyre practically the same but this isnt an issuesbased job its a job that requires fundraising coordinating the individual state parties and coalition building with entrenched interests like labor perez is perfect for it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,welcome to the leftwing purity test
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the far left bernie or bust wing wants stalinstyle purges of the party against those who arent as far left as they are honestly its in part thanks to some of them the russians and the overall stupidity of of the american people that trump is now potus
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the most important topic currently is jobs this guy is for the tpp and for keeping money in politics
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bernie and his supporters joined all of fifteen minutes ago and have been alltooeager to remind us that theyre not really democrats and that we cant count on them at all that really says it all excellent post
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that corporate money resolution didnt pass not because the democrats are evil neoliberals but because the mensa candidates who wrote it dont understand that corporation is a legal description they didnt bother to word the resolution so that democrats could still take money from unions small businesses and progressive non profits
SubredditDrama,not_removed,californias democratic primaries are open to independents but its such a leftleaning state that that probably doesnt hurt anything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would agree with you more of it wasnt for the dnc losing seats nationwide in the last years how can we view that as anything but a failure to capture the energy of the election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,former primary candidate who spent years attacking us im not familiar with the democratic party or its history but how did bernie attack them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the problem is that you dont want concessions you want capitulation concession is bernie getting a third of the platform committee concession is adopting his policies concession is giving ellison the secondincommand position to the one he wanted capitulation is what these guys are looking for an admission that were wrong and theyre right and that we will now submit to their will and follow their dictates theres been a growing problem that came to a head right when trump and sanders became more than punchline candidates the discourse is now dominated by talk of capitulation where the government was designed from the constitution up for concession its massive failures of civics all over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if you follow this logic you have no right to complain about trump because you arent a republican
SubredditDrama,not_removed,show up to meetings for your county and precinct committees run for positions of influence and apply pressure to perez to extend real reforms if he wants our votes an end of superdelegates or proportional superdelegate allocation primaries open to independents and sameday registration odd that getting rid of caucuses isnt in that list s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it does belong to us and since you guys managed to help get trump into office his government belongs to you as well i dont think thats fair to say people shouldnt feel compelled to vote strategically as far as im concerned the reason clinton lost was because she and her campaign couldnt motivate people to actually go out and vote for her considering only of people voted i think its fair to say that any candidate in an american election should be most concerned with actually getting their supporters to come out and vote at all rather than voting for them specifically trump managed to do that clinton didnt though thats just my own theory
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the difference is the tea partys corporate overlords are damn good at coopting the movement and funding the organization that led to our current situation the remnants of the bernie movement were terrible at organization and persuasion then as they are now they should just do what theyve been bitching about for months and leave the party anyway im not convinced there are that many disgruntled crybabies to make a difference
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i wonder if even they believe that strategy would be successful or if they just want to destroy everything out of spite
SubredditDrama,not_removed,worked for teddy roosevelt and the bull moose party s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not about getting a liberal president anymore its about punishment and the forces that helped radicalize bernie supporters during the primaries whether it be russia or or whoever will again be fanning the flames in order to fracture the left
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how are you gonna call yourself a progressive but yet you are willing to give up on a party just because some of the people who run it some its candidates dont agree with your ideals thats actually par for the course for progressives my way or the highway is the only game they know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,corbyn is also a terrible candidate he supports hamas a globally recognized terrorist organization and has the charisma of a wet paper bag
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh absolutely the way this place works is that the intellectually superior users of this subreddit mock whoevers been linked for arguing over something stupid and then proceed to passiveaggressively recreate the exact same argument
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which then leads to the dems moving to the right to capture trump voters would not surprise me one bit of we saw a serious attempt at a joe manchin or similar presidency because all the progressives are impossible to motivate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt they also use breitbart as a source for their crazy stories at times in my eyes they are close to the same type of dumb
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anyone else feel like the online sanders supporters are just actually trump supporters being trolls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it makes me sad to see whats happened to it i was all for bernie and during the primaries early at least it was so full of optimism and energy and then it just slowly turned into a black hole of unreasonable progressive rage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i hate the constant everyone is a shill comments but there are absolutely people trying to push the riggedcorrupt dnc narrative with only the intention of riling up sanders supporters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yup and its not just rethoric they spend a year of primaries throwing shit at any part of the democratic party not realizing that its going to stick no matter what candiate their enemy was always other democrast never the political opposition
SubredditDrama,not_removed,all of those people who were voting for trump because sanders lost tells me exactly what kind of people they are they were just waiting for an excuse so they could justify trump to themselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair most of the outrage seems to be confined to year olds that get angry and vent on reddit i havent really seen a slew of articles of prominent progressive dems coming out over this in anger
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i suspect hes going to eventually realize he shouldnt publicly endorse anyone since a large portion of his faction will inevitably scream about the system being rigged if his preferred pick doesnt win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres an increasing amount of people who treat corruption as synonymous with not what i want to be happening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont bother with rpolitics theyre back on the clinton was a horrible cunt bernie is the bestest ever circlejerk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its not like most of them were democrats in the first place or aware of politics or voters for that matter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you really think the average voter even knows who the party chairmen even are and keith ellison is a congressman for minnesota so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ellison is a popular midwestern politician whos gotten good results in his district
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he also had the added benefit of pissing off rightly or wrongly so a shitload of democrats given his prior associations with antisemites im kinda glad they went with perez as the figurehead while ellison can work his magic behind his cover
SubredditDrama,not_removed,progressives are butthurt because everyone else doesnt want to let the minority of the party call all the shots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he only a handful of votes away from winning it and hes a wellrespected politician from a state that trump won if anyone has an idea on how to win the midwest ellisons one
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i doubt shes going to do anything in american politics for a while the people who like her dont really need encouragement and the people who do need encouragement dont like her shes still well respected outside of the us so she may do stuff there something along the lines of what kennedy does but not necessarily legal stuff
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its funny because i saw folks ripping on her because she didnt come to the womens march or give speeches in december like bernie who is still fighting for us now because shes making snarky tweets and a jackass pundit or two is spinning theories about her running again or for nyc mayor theyre getting mad at her cant win lol
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and in modern politics people who have lost the presidency not the nomination but the presidency dont really try again i dont know why people have this idea hildawg is gonna
SubredditDrama,not_removed,chappaqua please dont misspell the native american name of my rich white hometown they kicked all the minorities out of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres rumours shell run for nyc mayor
SubredditDrama,not_removed,according to the magazines at my local right aid she is busy getting sentenced to life in prison
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a bunch of charity work now she has time to spare she can fully devote herself to that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,becoming lady grey of the chippaqua squirrels that was beautiful
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mayor of new york
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i highly doubt shed do stuff in politics again for a whole host of reasons shell probably stick to cgicf and giving input via twitter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot of progressives hated obama sanders wanted somebody to primary him in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to some yeah he supported hillary the narrative was lol obama hates hillary until he supported her then it became that he was a sellout loser
SubredditDrama,not_removed,anyone who opposed comrade sta err bernie must be purged
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hell they should actually check bernies comment on the issue i congratulate tom perez on his election as chairman of the democratic national committee and look forward to working with him sanders said in a statement at a time when republicans control the white house the us house us senate and twothirds of all statehouses it is imperative that tom understands that the sameold sameold is not working and that we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before the lawmaker added i think thats a pretty fucking clear cut case
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have friends who maintain that the clintons threatened to off bernie if he didnt endorse theyre being serious too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the republicans had twenty years of character assignation against hillary and she wasnt particularly charismatic before that thats why
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have a feeling most of them are actually td astroturfing
SubredditDrama,not_removed,during the election that actually mattered last year a similar endorsement just wasnt good enough of people who voted for sanders in the primary also voted for hillary in the general this is more than the proportion of hillary supporters who voted for obama in the whole stabintheback myth around this is utterly absurd
SubredditDrama,not_removed,right im very ok with this especially because he gave ellison a high position just like how hillary basically picked up all of bernies platform
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair a lot of peoples outlook has changed between the election and now even i imagine for sanders stans
SubredditDrama,not_removed,
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i never got why ellison became so popular over night it seemed to me everyone just needed a smiling muslim to install to feel progressive give me real socialistsssssss
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but he wasnt the one picked by our lord and savior bernie sanders so he isnt good enough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then again people in that sub think that primarying joe manchin in west virginia is a good idea because he is too conservative i mean id support that too but im a spiteful fucker who resents what his daughters done at mylan with epipen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shes just wandering in upstate ny somewhere tweeting snarky oneliners at trump thatd be her staff clinton signs her tweets h
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean its to be expected i actually really dislike the treatment people get when they first get involved in politics this isnt easily researched procedures and its likely this was a lot of peoples first really passionately involved election of course theyre going to come to meetings and post online confused about things most people barely understand the ramifications of gerrymandering let alone the nitty gritty of election processes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you said why it matters yourself there were controversies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she was incredibly unprofessional and she resigned after obama had to convince her to
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they always forget that she killed sanders in the popular vote i voted for sanders but i have no illusions about who he was these people think literally the lord and savior was repressed when in reality a far left democrat that appeals to the college aged kid couldnt get the rest of america on board
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i was going to say exactly that reince priebus this is like the third time ive had to google how to spell that bastards name becoming trumps chief of staff probably helped reinforce their misconception as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they dont even know that when there is a democratic president that they mostly hand pick the dnc chair obama picked dws on purpose yes she then was elected the dnc chair but only after president obama gave his approval the republican presidents enjoy similar powers of the rnc when they are in office unofficially trump now gets to pick who officially heads the rnc if they hated dws then they had a problem with obama but they didnt want to have a problem with obama so instead they attacked dws
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but how are you going to get your che guevara look just right if you dont look in the mirror
SubredditDrama,not_removed,til rdebbieforpresident is a thing ha
SubredditDrama,not_removed,his district is the most democratic in the state with a split the last republican to hold the seat was in over years ago its not like hes won people over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that he got called out so quickly in a forum where his lies wouldnt gain traction yeah too bad that shit would easily find its way in to the soft brains of altrighters
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dang what i miss
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh good the white house is now reddit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the thing is perez and ellison agreed prior to the vote to basically cochair the dnc regardless of the outcome in my mind that signals that no matter who the figurehead is were getting the same for deal with added bonus of one guy still being in congress to help with legislation but what do i know
SubredditDrama,not_removed,deputy chair is a brand new position that isnt elected tulsi gabbard was vice chair which is different and is elected
SubredditDrama,not_removed,because the deputy chair position has no power just like dnc chair in general the actual power for the chair is to get some fund through fundrising etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres a point where its not even worth it to type out the same response to a person who may or may not be willing to reconsider their stances this should be the internets motto
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so us shills just have to wait you guys out and youll give up good to know ill inform my fellow shills immediately
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its frustrating im a bernie bro but when he lost the primaries i voted clinton and im fine with perez
SubredditDrama,not_removed,didnt bernie endorse perez
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a job that requires fundraising coordinating the individual state parties and coalition building with entrenched interests like labor perez is perfect for it perez highest elected office was attorney general of maryland ellison is a congressman the voting turnout in ellisons district has increased every election he has been a congressman the question isnt is perez a good candidate it is why was he encouraged to run after ellison became the front runner
SubredditDrama,not_removed,international trade makes products cheaper opposing it for the sake of creating jobs is essentially levying a sales tax to create jobs in the us in particular our imports are cheap consumer goods so this sales tax would very disproportionately affect the poor shouldnt the progressive position be to have trade and then redistribute the wealth gained through trade tax the wealthy and then hire people for infrastructure development or just give people money protectionism encourages national identity which seems like a slap in the face to the leftist tradition of antistatism and opposition to hierarchy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tpp is good for american jobs and american economy hes not for money in politics he just doesnt want to unilaterally hamstring the dems thatd be irresponsible
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not to mention that the resolution was about the scheduling of the resolution on whether to accept donations
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they didnt bother to word the resolution so that democrats could still take money from unions small businesses and progressive non profits and even that wouldnt have changed anything since corporations can just launder donations through pacs
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah ive seen this floating around twitter except it seems to be inaccurate the phrasing of the resolution introduced by christine pelosi yes that pelosiand yes she is actually quite bright is virtually identical to the one that was passed upon obama taking office its just reintroducing a rule that the dnc got rid of a little while ago
SubredditDrama,not_removed,open primaries are actually httpsballotpediaorgopenprimary throughout the united states its a valid way to go
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which would be a fabulous critique if it didnt ignore that those seats were won by the same omg bad neoliberals who are now being blamed for not keeping them if you want to look at democrats actually getting their asses kicked you should go back and look at how badly we lost when we tried the energize the farleft base strategy before clinton how can we view that as anything but a failure to capture the energy of the election theres a valid complaint that the democrats focus far too much on national races and dont work hard enough to win local and statewide elections thats absolutely a tactical shift we need but energizing the base at the cost of moderates doesnt actually win elections obama could appeal to both berniecrats represent a little less than half moderates a little more than half the problem is that the more berniecrats insult and deride us and continue to refuse to accept a compromise as sufficient hearing them the more its an allornothing demand
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we hunted the blue dogs down to near extinction and are now absolutely shocked that we lost all these seats to the republicans whoocoodanode
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it wasnt that he energized black people to vote in record numbers and still only barely won because mccain was a decent human being
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we just need to insult social democrats more and then we will win its a foolproof strategy in fact wed pretty much be winning if it wasnt for socialists and anarchists s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you could make the argument that years of the most progressive president ever lost the democrats seats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look at what happens to the presidents party it was a worse scale but thats what always happens it also happened because obama went to the left or looked to be with the aca sanders would have done the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,do you want the specific soundbites or a broader characterization of his politics of consistently arguing that democrats and republicans are basically the same and democrats are bad my favorites my own feeling is that the democratic party is ideologically bankrupt the main difference between the democrats and the republicans in this city is that the democrats are in insurance and the republicans are in banking they have no ideology their ideology is opportunism i am not a democrat because the democratic party does not represent and has not for many years the interests of my constituency we have to ask ourselves why should we work within the democratic party if we dont agree with anything the democratic party says absolute favorite now you can say all of those were fair points but a i obviously disagree with the fairness of those attacks and b a fair attack is still an attack
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think thats fair to say people shouldnt feel compelled to vote strategically i pretty clearly disagree with both of those statements as far as im concerned the reason clinton lost was because she and her campaign couldnt motivate people to actually go out and vote for her considering only of people voted i think its fair to say that any candidate in an american election should be most concerned with actually getting their supporters to come out and vote at all rather than voting for them specifically i absolutely agree and have my own theories about how clintons campaign dropped that particular ball but i cant help but observe that part of how people who would otherwise have come out to support clinton stayed home appears to be that attacks against her stuck more than against other candidates which i attribute in part to being given the veneer of objectivity because both sanders and trump used the same attacks
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hes also a protectionist meaning that protrade britons are forced into the libdems instead of either the tories who made brexit happen or labour
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hell this thread is nearly the same level of drama as the op however i like my popcorn so please do carry on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well i sure am glad you stopped by to be the intellectual superior to us intellectual superiors
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tyt is a bunch of self absorbed idiots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,constantly the people who pointed this out were downvoted and called a corporate shill
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont believe in shoe horse theory but sanders and trumps superfans are virtually indistinguishable and might as well be incestuous cousins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah they were played by donald people like a fiddle they were so rabid against clinton that they ate up everything they could get against he no matter what source they would have put stormfront on the frontpage if it had some drivel about clinton not being aryan enough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,probably didnt help that during the late stages of the primary it ended up getting taken over by rthedonald so
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the gregorian calendar was abolished after civil war ii
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ugh god please no jesus ugh
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if sanders runs again in he never cared about anything but himself selfishness will be his permanent legacy
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh yeah and a lot of it comes from people who post to td because it gets people riled up about things besides trump and they can say liberals are too busy fighting each other to care which is true hillary lost because the party refused to unite trump won because his party united behind him and while he was full of scandal he was viewed as harmless
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im started to just assume that the people who complain about the shills are the actual shills
SubredditDrama,not_removed,maybe they are just sick of politicians there isnt really much difference in the republican and democrat party anymore hillarys ideology would be considered staunch republican years ago i think voting for trump out of frustration was a huge mistake but i can certainly understand why someone would do it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a cult of personality has its disadvantages
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the more we see from sanders and better we get to know him the more it becomes clear he cant see past his own passions to understand when he is hurting them hes not ultimately leadership material
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well he never before had trouble shitting on the democrats so idk why hed start worrying about that now hell he still wont even call himself a democrat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he should realize now and during the primaries exactly the damage he wasis doing if not hes incompetent
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which also has an negative cueing effect by which i mean everyone else who was angry about the last fight with these folks immediately becomes way more suspicious of whateverwhoever hes endorsed then needed and wary of the issue in general i really doubt hell realize this is his effect he endorsed a bunch of measures in random states too he probably sees it as just leveraging his popularity tbf
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i know someone who voted bernie in the primary and johson in the general never cared about politics before avid redditor and about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no one knew who debbie wassermanschultz was before that rage moment during the primaries
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is what the gop did with the tea party
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ellison is from minnesota hillary won that state not trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would bet heavily that shes just gonna go back to nonspotlight type work
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have no problem with her stepping aside tbh id like to let the next generation of superstar dems develop we need to refill the talent pool thats been left behind because right now the biggest superstars are all old as shit warren bernie etc and we basically need a president who can be cool if i had to guess i think she just sticks to clinton foundation stuff
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what kennedy does what kennedy are you talking about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah hillary cant do anything without someone screaming at her shes quiet how dare she stay silent shes so privileged cough shaun king cough she speaks out how dare she speak doesnt she know that shes obsolete in the new democratic party even if she was shown on tv buying tomatoes itll be five seconds until how dare she buy tomatoes this is clearly a ploy to get attention
SubredditDrama,not_removed,modern politics is an incredibly small sample size nixon lost in but ran again and won in and if you include people who lost the nomination but ran again it suddenly becomes very common
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jeez totally ignore william jennings bryan whydontcha s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,true but theres always breathless speculation about it until some knew person fills the void
SubredditDrama,not_removed,was about to correct op too cant have our home besmirched like that you go to greeley as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some progressives werent satisfied with obama i doubt any hated him
SubredditDrama,not_removed,one thing thats really important to understand about millennial voters is that they came of age during the bush years and a lot of their politics are defined by that to them hillarys vote to authorize the use of force for the iraq war made her permanently radioactive this was part of what cost hillary the nomination in it may have contributed to her losing in its telling that obamas drone strike program was one of the things they objected to same thing they dislike hrc more than they liked obama we can argue about how silly that is given that all but one democrat voted for it but i think the big takeaway is that current democratic members of congress need to get the message that votes like that can be a permanent black mark on your political career among segments of the base it is not impossible that well see another terror attack and another vote like that one over the next four years hopefully they will remember and understand you can see a similar thing in britain where blairs support for the war blew his party to hell for a generation its comparable to the severe damage that lbjs support for vietnam did to the democratic party too sometimes even when youre facing intense pressure you need to look ahead and think about how a vote will play out and look years from now especially for major generationdefining things like wars
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i congratulate tom perez on his election as chairman of the democratic national committee and look forward to working with him sanders said in a statement i actually saw somebody in a thread on chide bernie for a tweet along that nature the purity test knows no bounds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah im sure the former secretary of fucking labor needs a lecture on working people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he was pretty clear about endorsing hillary too not that that swayed these people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not an person but what the heck is bernie going to say perez is totally unqualified this election was rigged millions of illegals voted for perez and thats the only reason ellison lost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,get better friends
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or maybe just maybe bernie is a rational person
SubredditDrama,not_removed,theres a weird type of voter who could essentially be a rabid sanders or trump person depending on minuscule differences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,unfortunately i dont think this is true bernie cultists dont need any help to make an ass of themselves
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like this is a lie everyone is trying to tell themselves the preelection behavior of the sanders fanatics is trying to be swept under the rug as trump supporters in disguise it most certainly was not
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some of the posters are assuredly concern trolling but ive encountered my share of progressives on reddit other websites and in real life who hold those sentiments with depressing honesty
SubredditDrama,not_removed,td trolls supporting a muslim candidate im shocked
SubredditDrama,not_removed,really gotta start tagging all those people so i can just call them out when they do that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have all recent td posters masstagged and im not seeing a lot of them definitely some trump supporters who arent td main accounts though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh absolutely i mean shit i was pulling for sanders back in the primary season but the squeaky wheel gets the kick and internet enclaves of obstinate progressives who revel in perpetuating halfassed conspiracy theories initially astroturfed by places like breitbart and engaging in frequent character assassination of particularly bloated straw women are among the squeakiest places out there the residents of those places will never change their minds or give up their cultlike obsessions and those mindsets are rightly derided as prime examples of shortsighted footshooting and facecutting spite
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of people who voted for sanders in the primary also voted for hillary in the general among those who voted i dont think there were a lot of bernie defectors but i do think that many of them didnt vote given how low democratic turnout was this year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,biggest problem is that in control several of the sandersprogressive subs giving them a bad name and dowsing rampant misinformation with a healthy dollop of trump trolls that know sowing discontent is good for republicans its sort of frustrating to deal with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these people think that everyone secretly agrees with them they just arent motivated enough to vote theyre fucking idiots
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exactly youve got to know when to stop pushing for more i live in a red state and would be ecstatic to see a moderatecentrist dem representative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is funny sanders and ellison have both congratulated perez
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and if i dont get first choice on which toys to play with im taking my toys and going home
SubredditDrama,not_removed,honest question liberals are saying the chair doesnt have much power ellison is in power although he was given a position that doesnt actually exist and that perez and ellison share similar values if its meaningless and there isnt much difference between the two why not do a symbolic gesture to help get the lefts support there doesnt seem to be any point to it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,agreed the thing that made us uneasy was the idea that that person seemed to feel that his opinions were paramount he yelled over the chair he yelled over people given the floor even when they agreed i know that not everyone who is into bernie is like this but it didnt leave me with a good impression of people brought to the process by the bernie machine
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they always forget that she killed sanders in the popular vote its never even been a factor to them due to the combination of its rigged narratives which started long before the dnc emails were leaked bernie running a delusional campaign all the way to the convention long after he lost any plausible chance at winningthese are the same people who began with bitching about undemocratic superdelegates ended with demandingexpecting superdelegates to just hand bernie the nomination wikileaks dropped snark from a private convo between lowlevel dnc staff donna brazile leaking a question about the flint michigan water crisis for the debate in flint michigan and thats enough for these people to dismiss the million more votes that hillary received
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive never understood why they thought bernie vs trump would lead to a good matchup itd just be two opposite extremes making a lot of people stay home most likely bernie would have lost and trump would still somehow become president
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is like the third time ive had to google how to spell that bastards name rnc pr bs the vowels are unimportant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to be fair resentment towards dws was a thing before the primary even started and even obama apparently didnt like her that much
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your about the superpac is just a transcript of a conservative blogger being interviewed on fox news domenech i think it i think it is going to make it tougher we saw this week reporting from the daily beast that a proclinton super pac had paid more than a million dollars to have supporters of her online push back against bernie supporters on facebook and twitter and instagram and places like that its its a sign of how hard it is to get people to support hillary clinton among the younger set and i think that thats the real challenge for her in this environment which is that younger voters who were key in electing president obama are not going to be convinced that shes someone who they really need to support and thats going to have to force her in a position where shes going to have to continue to appeal to their more liberal positions on a lot of these issues as she goes into a general as opposed to pivoting back to the center thats going to be a real challenge for her and its one of the reasons why i think sanders supporters the or so percent that juan was referring to are going to prove a tougher nut to crack for hillary in a general election ph fun fact the he sources just sources a from a sanders supporter who turned out to just be a trump supporter pretending to like bernie so you are quoting a dnc mail quoting a blogger on fox news quoting the daily beast quoting a reddit comment from an rthedonald regular
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if bernie lost because he wasnt adequately prepared to answer a question on the michigan water crisis in michigan then maybe be wasnt prepared to be president
SubredditDrama,not_removed,holy gish gallop batman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,pretty much all of the emails you linked to happened which was midapril or so and written about quite a bit at the start of may the donna brazile thing was a bit of a shame but its not like there were any super surprising questions in there that any qualified candidate wouldnt be preparing for anyway one of the questions that was passed along was a woman who was going to ask about water pollution for a debate in flint they wanted to pull a commentary segment from msnbc if you check the email leaks youll see that they very often ask their video team to acquire a copy of a media piece for their uses maybe commercials or reviewing something not really sure and they use this phrasing pull it pull a copy etc in that email christina is asking the communications team to pull a copy of it along with a transcript i know that eichenwald comes off as a bit pissed and he is but is worth the read
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nice post you have there shame that bernie lost by millions of votes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and they are legitimately good friends which makes me think they are on the same page
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont worry theyll respond several times to your comment and declare themself the winner because you wont sit there and explain why some grainy youtube video with a creepy looking neckbeard supporting their claim is a bad source
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to the shillcopter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,same here im an idealist but also a fucking realist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre a rational bernie bro though you didnt decide well bernie lost time to vote trump to teach the dnc a lesson like these idiots did
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a statewide office is bigger than a congressional office especially when they congressional office was held by a democrat before ellison ran for the first time its not like he kicked a republican out of office in either event thats irrelevant to the job which is more akin to running a large organization which perez has plenty of experience doing perez only ran because obama asked him to run sure ellison was the frontrunner having grabbed all the establishment endorsements he could before christmas but perez worked his ass off to win and he deserved it if he puts that kind of effort into everything he does which he seems to have his entire career then the dnc is in good hands hes a class act like obama and like obama he brought ellison into the fold right away i still wish biden was chair but im excited
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look at how badly we lost when we tried the energize the farleft base strategy before clinton is that why we got smashed by reagan and bush sr
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah man what we need to do is nominate a strong progressive candidate loved by the leftwing and refuse to compromise our message just because of shifts in the political views of americans if you knew any american political history or were older than youd know how well that strategy worked out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,most progressive president ever fdr truman johnson ring any bells
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude who didnt pass single payer didnt prosecute banks and kept getting us in foreign wars is suddenly progressive
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its possible the situation couldve been worse had hillary actually won typically state governments and the house tend to swing to the opposite party of the presidency so years of a democrat in the white house would likely have continued the reddening trend well see if people are pissed off enough now since historically the democrats have sucked at energizing the base to get out and vote in off years
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what always happens the ds are in their worst spot since this definitely does not always happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they have no ideology their ideology is opportunism so they have both no ideology and an ideology
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think they stuck more because clinton has had more time under mainstream scrutiny and been a prominent figure in american politics for a long time that allowed people to easily attack her on being kind of a turncoat which is fair enough not to mention all the allegations of corruption levied against her from all sides though i dont agree that sanders and trump used the same attacks sanders mainly attacked clintons record as a politican and her cozying up to corporate interests trumps attacks were more aimed at her being a politican not being conservative not being for the war on terror etc not to mention that trump often used the resentment many americans have for their politicians against almost all candidates he ran against in both the primaries and the general election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think it has something to do with the type of people that only get involved in politics via online shitposting just like the xbox live is not representative for the motherfucking ability of year olds
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but sanders and trumps superfans are virtually indistinguishable and might as well be incestuous cousins seriously trumps superfans are taking assault rifles in search of pizzagate and are shooting indians because they think theyre muslims how many of bernies did the same
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there are huge differences which is why everyone is so mad about trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is what the gop did with the tea party the tea party that won the republicans the house in the senate in and secured a republican president in who pandered to them on many of their core issues that tea party was pretty fucking successful actually
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if i had to guess i think she just sticks to clinton foundation stuff thats what i meant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,id actually think itd be awesome if she started practicing law again and bringing cases against the trump administration especially in regards to immigration it would just be fantastic to have her argue a case that strikes down one of trumps executive orders
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ive been hearing whispers that chelsea will run in but it seems awfully early to tell maybe im thinking of congress
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im calling it now bookerwarren booker needs to get married first though
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oops justice kennedy he does a lot of international work helping other countrys judicial systems especially countries that are new or have recently had major changes in their system he is also a huge proponent of having a more international approach to jurisprudence
SubredditDrama,not_removed,mrs kennedy my thirdgrade teacher
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shilling for her masters big tomato
SubredditDrama,not_removed,think is nixon was in his when he lost clinton will be this year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nixon was almost half a century ago and he specifically said that losing a party nomination is different
SubredditDrama,not_removed,vote for taft now you can vote for bryan anytime
SubredditDrama,not_removed,william jennings bryan just wouldnt give up
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or henry clay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,adlai stevenson in and against dwight eisenhower
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lets not forget the prestigious grover cleveland who had two nonconsecutive terms losing an election after his first term to benjamin harris then returning in the election after harris term and winning the election for his second and last term
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeppers
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot of people were actually angry with the drone attacks and the nsa stuff obama wasnt the ideal progressive candidate
SubredditDrama,not_removed,am progressive love obama to no end yet somewhat disappointed in a few things he kept from the bush administration mostly nsa data collection
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no you dont understand this is politics either youre a huge fan of someone or you hate them with a fiery passion
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and they would have turned on ellison too as soon as he did something crazy like not support primary challengers for every d senator who voted for a trump appointee
SubredditDrama,not_removed,these are people who wouldnt vote for clinton the person sanders endorsed you cant really reason with them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we democrats have a long tradition of intraparty strife it was will rogers who once said i dont believe in organized political parties im a democrat when democrats get their acts together they can win elections sadly we like to cause ourselves to lose a lot of elections by butting heads with each other its our time honored tradition
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean shet im a prounity and the idea that this is a popular view is pretty dank its a popular view in the same way hillary is more popular than trump in wv
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bernie is obviously a shill that bernie would not support
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my cousin is one of the geniuses who was both
SubredditDrama,not_removed,my father who is very active in the local and state democratic party on state board served as district chair got a call after the election from some guy he never heard of talking about getting together berniecrats and discussing a new direction for the democratic party he finished by saying if you were a hillary supporter dont even bother my dad has been involved in the democratic party for years during the primaries he was the bernie vote organizer for the county and my mother was the hillary vote organizer the state utilized a caucus system my dad was taken aback by this guy stomping around and deciding that the local democratic party needs to be punched in the ass because the caller thought the dnc gave bernie a raw deal even though the state went hard for bernie my dad had never saw or heard of this person before and he basically ran the democratic party in the county bernie cultists are definitely out there and they want to burn shit down especially party veterans they dont give a shit about people who have been active in the democratic party and they dont know how the party runs at a local level as a kid that has spent several hours licking envelops sending out newsletters and marching in parades and knocking on doors for campaigns i dont have a lot of respect for these people who suddenly want to take the party reigns up the second after they decide that politics is their calling
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre wrong there are many trump voters masquerading as progressives ive been tagging them and arguing with them later its pretty easy to find their views by sorting their controversial comments and going back to november or so they act like progressives and try to stir up shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the remaining die hard bernie people are basically the political equivalent of dudes who still pine for their high school girlfriend even though its been years and shes happily married with kids now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its a mix at least ive seen a not insignificant amount of td regulars on
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i feel like its about half useful idiots half astroturfing asshats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,click on a random username in the thread most have td as most of their history or a new account
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yea these guys booed and protested during the dnc they certainly exist
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youll always find obstinate loud conspiracy theorists on any side what good is cherrypicking the most outthere claims of the most outthere people really i mean some people on the opposing side straight up call sanders a white nationalist etc
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well now thats ultimately the partys problem its not very democratic of the democratic party to be entitled to votes maybe maybe it should actually find ways of convincing people to do the thing instead of calling them names
SubredditDrama,not_removed,x aids the enemy so shut up and fall in line is in the long run a worse threat to democracy than a bunch of pissstained nationalist buffoons just sayin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nonvoters are economically to the left of voters trying to get nonvoters to vote with an economically left platform is much smarter than trying to compete over the tiny number of nonpartisan centrists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bernie endorsed hillary and look how good that went for her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ellison and perez are personal friends
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it wasnt just berniecrats endorsing ellison liz warren john lewis chuck schumer howard dean and gloria steinem all endorsed ellison thats a pretty broad range of people right there from establishment democrats to civil rights leaders and feminist icons acts childish but remember there are leftists outside of reddit who do feel frustrated that theyre repeatedly asked to compromise with a party that has no interest in making compromises with them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,oh no that guy sounds like an ass who will be out the door when it comes time to wade through the mud its just important that in general we dont alienate people who dont understand the system right now or lump everyone together in with loud angry redditors this goes for literally everyone every human being
SubredditDrama,not_removed,man that was a face palming moment some people were posting studies based on the work of a jfkconspiracy theorist who had no idea how exit polls worked and who claimed that all elections had been stolen by the winning party all of them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and democrats are surprised when conservatives do the exact same thing but without any kind of self awareness cry voter fraud trump will do the same call fox news fake now that its taken to its logical extreme its suddenly awful dont respect the system and itll inspire some asshat on the other to really treat it like shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,remember the many many posts insisting that there was widespread voter fraud that ballots werent being counted that bernie supporters were being blocked from voting err sorry what i dont know if they were being blocked from voting but
SubredditDrama,not_removed,its never even been a factor to them due to its rigged narratives
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nothing delusional about him running until the convention he said he would do it and he did it he did a lot in pulling clinton left but unfortunately she was far too unlikable and overly confident to even beat trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think its that sanders was sort of different and would have mobilized more people in the way trump did i think sanders also managed to speak to the lower class white demographic with his education policies thats an area where clinton simply didnt reach out to to bring in whats interesting is the idea that sanders was winning in head to head polls but as we saw there was clearly a hidden vote for trump im not sure if that would have been the case if sanders won also i think that much of the clinton hate was rooted in sexism and i think trump would have had to take a different strategy if it was against sanders make no mistake im not saying the election would have been different but i can see an argument in retrospect the fact is however that the voting populous clearly favored clinton in the primary and general election and those numbers clearly indicate that sanders didnt earn the democratic nomination pretty fairly
SubredditDrama,not_removed,his name is also an anagram of eerie rnc pubis
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so what youre saying is that hes actually a demon from the abyss yeah it only makes sense
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the donna brazile thing was a bit of a shame it was unfair rigging of the primary whether or not the four debate questions were obvious or not three of them the not flint ones were not and that was important to someone as legendarily wooden and fakesounding as clinton i dont read eichenwald hes a paranoid conspiracy theorist that once had a rthathappened spiel in newsweek about yelling at a jill stein voter and saying theyre lucky punching them was illegal its very rare that anything he says is worth reading or bears much resemblance to reality and i remember a lot of people calling out that piece specifically for being bananas
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dont you know hillary rigged all state democratic parties who actually run the primaries and caucuses to win
SubredditDrama,not_removed,are you going to read or respond to any of it or just use a trite smug childish liberal putdown that convinces nobody i can do that too i guess shame that clinton lost under rules that were known since the when they easily could have won with bernie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or maybe thats just what the neoliberal establishment shills want you to believe s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,or at least willing to always hear what the other guy has to say
SubredditDrama,not_removed,seriously im willing to bet they talked it out over a personal dinner at one of their houses
SubredditDrama,not_removed,batshill and bottin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i get the impression a lot of these people are very young and come from relatively well off backgrounds where their parents very rarely said ¨no¨ theyre privileged people who have the luxury of being able to afford to demand perfection in a political party
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ellisons seat has literally chance of going to a republican ever i live here i love ellison but this is hardly a disappointment also do we really want to hear however many years of the dnc is run by a jihadist which we know the right wing news would repeat over and over
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it could also have just been broad shifts in american political views but nominating two of the most liberal candidates in history didnt help from humphrey through dukakis we basically got our asses kicked because we did exactly what disaffected bernie supporters are demanding now which is fine and maybe they can argue that itd have been better longterm to not have the thirdway democrats or triangulation but that needs to be an argument refusing to acknowledge it because moderate democrats lost seats that the moderates themselves won after salvaging the disasters of mcgovern and dukakis is just ignorant
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no reagan was a movie star and the bush team was working on the willie horton ad while dukakis rode around in a tank yall makin me feel old
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people dont like any ideas that are espoused by principlefree corrupt hacks even donny trump a man who shits on a golden toilet was somehow able to appeal to the average working person better than hillary clinton who would turn into a scarecrow if she was any more wooden on stage
SubredditDrama,not_removed,funny you mention truman look up wallace truman was literally installed by corporate interests to prevent a progressive and popular democratic candidate from running if you want a more explicit example of rigging primaries theres really no better option
SubredditDrama,not_removed,johnsons war in vietnam was hated by the progressive left truman would be considered a globalist shill by the sanders wing and fdr ill give you but is exceptional
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah depending how you define progressive can get you into trouble nearly everything they supported is common in the democratic party today see where they felt about womens and other minorities rights go ask fdr about his stance on trans rights and no way would they be considered progressive today but defining it as how far away from the mainstream yeah obama isnt close to progressive compared to them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,you got another president that lowered carbon emissions reduced the prison population increased the insurance rate raised taxes on the wealthiest and did prosecute banks to the tune of a quarter billion you are aware the president isnt a dictator who can snap his fingers and make things happen right he cant prosecute executives for laws that didnt exist pre dodd frank he cant pass single payer when almost a fifth of the nation didnt have insurance at all as for no foreign wars his lack of intervention in syria allowed genocide its not progressive to never fight any war no matter how just
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i agree i think a d win means republicans possibly get votes in
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and that was because they tried to push what was seen as a big government program and the gop is amazing at media control
SubredditDrama,not_removed,almost trumpian in the doublespeak horseshoe theory strikes again
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i cant tell if youre making a joke or actually dont understand the criticism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think he is getting at the fact that opportunism is not actually a political ideology or at least is not a set of political principles that would constitute an ideology
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no those people are mentally ill you cantas much as id like to blame trump for them same way jodie foster doesnt get blamed for trying to assassinate reagan
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youd be surprised ive seen bernorbusters who believe in pizzagate too and dont forget that many in the bernie crowd still believe that clinton had a dnc staffer assassinated last year
SubredditDrama,not_removed,trump isnt a republican if someone like george bush had been elected we wouldnt be seeing the backlash just some grumbling on the left because the differences between what the republican party was pretrump and the democrats are minimal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the tea party was essentially an astroturf campaign after the libertarians left funded by the koch brothers it wasnt a real movement and really only consisted of furtherright candidates primary moderates out of existence in the republican party this only worked because of gerrymandering which encourages crazier farright politicians and koch money
SubredditDrama,not_removed,chelsea had a front row view of everything that happened to hillary i doubt she wants on in any of that shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nothing even someone close to the family says but without being named official as far as ive heard but if she does it certainly wouldnt be for the wh she would lose the primary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no way shes ready for a presidential run itd have to be congress for a few terms first maybe an ambassadorship next time a dem gets to the white house
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is much more likely the clintonites push gillibrand to run for president and chelsea runs for her us senate seat
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no thank you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,more like practicing her homemade pasta sauce recipe in a shameless attempt to woo the italian american vote when she runs for nyc mayor we see what youre doing shillary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,also bluntly nixon was extremely popular among republicans and had a natural base of support as the leading anticommunist candidate and he lost to one of the most popular candidates of his generation there was no shame in losing to jfk i voted for clinton in the general but while shes obviously popular among democrats as anyone who wins the nomination would have to be there is still an intense backlash against her among some segments of the democratic base so she does not unite her party the same way nixon did and she does not really have a core base of support the way nixon did a lot of the people who supported her for the nomination did so because they thought she was the most electable candidate a loss ends that also perhaps most importantly as close as it was she ultimately lost to one of the least popular candidates of her generation there are other factors though politics is a lot more negative nowadays a big part of the reason clinton lost was because she was carrying the weight of years of negative republican ad dollars and congressional wrangling even if she was young enough to run again it would be idiotic to give them more value for their money on all that after its been proven decisively that that did enough damage to sink her once already to be honest one thing i think the last few elections have shown is that candidates who come up from comparative obscurity are stronger because they dont have the weight of all those negative ads obama george w bush bill clinton all of them lacked a national profile hell even trump who was wellknown but had never faced the scrutiny or opposition a politician does he did a lot of damage to himself but i think it sometimes takes more than one election cycle for a narrative to stick which let him keep supporters despite all the damage he took this also explains the baffling fact that he was perceived as more honest yes he lied constantly but a few months of lying in the public spotlight couldnt compete with years of clinton being tarred as dishonest by the rightwing media
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nixon lost the general election in not the party nomination
SubredditDrama,not_removed,see that one is particularly befuddling the modern primary system didnt exist yet so the party establishment could pick whomever they wanted stevenson lost pretty badly to eisenhower in why did they think he could beat him in in the middle of some of americas best economic years if they wanted to win they should have picked lbj or something
SubredditDrama,not_removed,go quakers if we werent terrible at like everything
SubredditDrama,not_removed,plus how whistleblowers were treated by his administration
SubredditDrama,not_removed,to me the drones were just a replacement for traditional assassination and a way to display to the entire world yeah this tech works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is my problem with politics on one hand i disagree with how little action obama took although much of it wasnt his fault but on the other hand i agreed with his immigration policy and the fact that he took our bloated military budget and did something with it really not sure where that puts me on the spectrum
SubredditDrama,not_removed,some of them already were turning on ellison there was a tiny movement in the kooky bernie subs like wayofthebern to push that noname douche sam ronan because ellison wasnt pure enough
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they can all fuck off i blame them in part for what we have now a small part of me will enjoy their suffering
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shrug most of us did circlejerking over this like its rtheronalds viewshift on weed days ago is pretty inaccurate but im fucking with your culture this is rsubredditdrama for gods sake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,forgive me but do you know what dank means
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats what bothers me about these progressive movements demanding to take over political parties they have contributed very little to these parties and now literally demand the men and women of those parties who actually do the hard work to simply shut up and follow their dictates its pretty entitled
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if someone like me were to ask people like your parents what the right way to get casually involved ie the level of occasionally volunteering a bit but not fullon every day this is my life kind of thing what would they say and i know im running the risk of conflating your parents political activity experience and knowledge with yours but id like to hear your answer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they dont give a shit about people who have been active in the democratic party and they dont know how the party runs at a local level they also dont give a shit about or know shit about actually winning elections
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the only way to do it take the people who suddenly show up say great thanks can you go register people to vote in in weekend every single one of them gains humility
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they exist theyre loud as fuck but theyre not all of us i think a large majority of the people that have come back to actually give a shit about the issues more than they do about the party there are always the same accounts that post everywhere but the general voting gist will tell you what they think
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the loudest antistatus quo its maybe a little unfair to use the blanket term sanders supporters or whatever given how long ago the primarieselection were despite many of their most ardent strongholds still hanging on the mans every word advocates seem most concerned about maintaining their ire at the man while people and organizations like ha goodman and tyt make fat fat bank by milking that demographics indignance and all that accomplishes is perpetuating unhelpful dialogue i feel that style of irrational demogoguery packs a lot of insidious danger into its comparatively small packages it should not be tolerated as healthy political discussion and it deserves to be called out
SubredditDrama,not_removed,tiny number of unaffiliated centrists absolutely false informationmich smarter to win moderate voters than people who wont show up anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,only after trashing her and the party even after it was virtually impossible for him to win the primary
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ellison is an evil guy who didnt fully support ellison im sure some bernie bro is getting ready to say that any minute now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the party bent over backwards for them of bernies agenda got into the platform they think anything short of getting of what they want is the party has no interest compromising with them
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol yea i dunno if it started more with bernie or social media echochambers with his supporters but either way his campaign definitely became a case of the cart leading the horse while the cart tossed lots of money at the horse the whole timebefore the primaries even began his supporters were howling about how voter registration deadlines dnc rigging for fucks sake
SubredditDrama,not_removed,jfc thats pathetic
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fair enough it wasnt delusional that he ran until the convention it was delusional that he ran until the convention pretending that it was a close race he was a competitive candidate i dont mean to suggest that bernie himself was delusional imho he knew what he was doing but he led a lot of people into believing that he could somehow receive the nomination right up until the bitter end he had no issues with trashing his one only opponent until about weeks prior to thatwhich was weeks after hed lost any realistic chance of winning on march after the first month of the primary hillary had more pledged delegates than bernie at the end of june the convention hillary had more pledged delegates than bernie
SubredditDrama,not_removed,republican national committee public relations bull shit in case you missed it but one of beelzebubs lackeys fits too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the questions really only matter if you think that clinton won the primary because four debate questions were leaked to her over dncsponsored debates the donna brazile thing is unfortunate but i fail to see how it can legitimately be considered evidence of anything interesting considering the negligible effect it couldve had on anything do you see anything in particular from eichenwalds piece that you specifically disagree with all of his points about the dates of the emails and the mathematical impossibility of bernies victory match the timeline of the emails youve posted and anyway bernie lost by a massive number of votes
SubredditDrama,not_removed,no she didnt and nobody has ever claimed that but the dnc did fuck around as i gave plenty of evidence for literally nobody in this entire thread has even bothered to dispute any of the facts its just downvoting and personal attacks and irrelevant red herrings no wonder the gop is owning your asses so completely on every level from cities to the presidency you cant win elections by blocking out facts you dont like
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if bernie was so much more popular than clinton why did he lose the popular vote to her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,could have won no one knows if bernie could have won or if he would have had a even larger defeat stop namecalling just because they say something you dont like the fact is bernie lost by a large margin
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gonna be honest im here to shitpost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they easily could have won with bernie lel
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rules that were known since the see right there not true the rules as they have existed since in case you are wondering the constitutional rules about the electoral college size are effected by the number of members of the house of representatives all through the century the number of house members was steadily increased part of the reason for that was to prevent situations where the loser of the popular vote could still win the electoral college but the last time the size of the house was increased was in took effect in it took a century but now we have had two elections in five where the loser of the popular vote won the electoral college a situation that only happened in once after we disregard and in the first centuries of this countries existence in case you are wondering is ignored because nobody won the popular voteand is ignored because extraconstitutional means determined that election outcome it was right after the us civil war and the house of reps was scared and didnt want to get involved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean history didnt start with dukakis and not everything is about the president a classic mistake that democrats seem to always make the argument is that an fdrlike populism was so popular that it was basically responsible for a democratic congressional majority that lasted from basically until gingrich that is decades and decades of control
SubredditDrama,not_removed,she won three million more votes than him average voters continues to imply that only white voters count this was an argument in the primaries too working class of course also only refers to white people s
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so thats a no on you having either knowledge of us political history or being older than the answer was a blowout by the way funny how the farlefts entire political knowledge is limited to but clinton
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dude there was news out there that called her a satanic pedo people died because of that shit im not susprised at all
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yes rigged primaries historically are the standard if you want a more explicit example of rigging primaries theres really no better option you would be surprised
SubredditDrama,not_removed,johnsons war in vietnam was hated by the progressive left the progressive left loves obamas drone warfare backing of saudi arabia and israel though its not obamas foreign policy which makes your claim wrong its his economic policy obama chose not to prosecute bank executives who created the financial crisis he chose not to go after hsbc for money laundering he did not go after wells fargo for mass fraud when it opened fake accounts his treasury department actively helped banks foreclose on million households he has done almost nothing to stop the consolidation of the economy into a handful of mega conglomerates obama is a centrist plain and simple
SubredditDrama,not_removed,people were defrauding others during the crash im well aware what the powers of the president are and im aware of the fact that he was elected with a majority house and senate and a mandate to move policy the aca is a boondoggle because he refused to wield that power to get people on single payer like it or not the average american hasnt seen massive gains in the years under obama and thats why the dems will keep losing lastly the great job the us did in libya should really put a nail in the coffin of the positive use of us power
SubredditDrama,not_removed,except trump administration officials like michael flynn were pushing those conspiracy theories
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and how many of them have grabbed a gun and decided to stalk clinton
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the more sane republicans i know are horrified by trump and wondering what happened to their party im still in shock that he won the primaries
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the tea party was essentially an astroturf campaign after the libertarians left funded by the koch brothers id say this is halftrue its certainly the case that the koch brothers registered the taxdayteaparty url and the group was pumped full of koch cash but i think its a step too far to argue it wasnt a movement at all people like sarah palin and glenn beck really rallied a kind of reactionary movement in the country and those fuckers put the fear of god into their representatives when they came to town halls
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i just looked into it more looks like people are speculating shell run for a seat in congress but yeah i wouldnt blame her for not wanting a repeat of
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i would note nixons loss in was one of the closest in history there was a realistic chance he could have won while losing the popular or that kennedy could have still won while losing the popular while he wasnt ridiculously ridiculously good looking like kennedy he certainly had his own form of charisma no one wins a massive landslide reelection like without that and he was a legitimate policy genius if not for his incredible paranoia criminal behavior and the shit he pulled with vietnam negotiations hed be considered a pretty good president
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and if you include people who lost the nomination but ran again it suddenly becomes very common
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and he went away until
SubredditDrama,not_removed,so did adlai stevenson in and and dewey in and
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we kill academic challenge
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i have no opposition to drones in general but high collateral damage assasination is a problem whatever the method
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it is pretty innovative that we are using technological solutions to disrupt the outdated paradigms of murdering civilians in foreign countries those old yemeni boys not only get to fear the clear blue skies but also respect the cando spirit and out of the box thinking of silicon valley
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot of the sanders supporters dont know how to constructively disagree with the rest of the party making pronouncements such as you refused to give me ice cream and cookies for dinner and you insisted to eat at least one serving of vegetables with dinner so in response to your evil ways im gong to nuke denver then they have the gall to act all surprised where the rest of the party refused to take them seriously
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i remember the thread the day before the election in rpoliticalrevolution sanders cant tell me who to vote for ill vote for jill stein goddamned morons not to mention rwayofthebern which is pretty much trumpers role playing as progressives
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i think that a lot of them were probably already in liberal states that really didnt need their votes one guy i knew wrote in sanders but being in california it wasnt like his vote mattered that much however i still think its a bad decision to not even vote for her and then turn around and say how bad trump is
SubredditDrama,not_removed,they think they can bury their head in the sand and shitpost on rmovies all day
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a good of the bernie supporters did vote for hillary who lost by in two very white states
SubredditDrama,not_removed,er no a lot of the people still active in and similar subs didnt vote for clinton they deserve the ridicule they get if you did my criticism isnt really aimed at you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,dankwhackyou know what i mean shit is off the hook generally
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it comes from entitlement naivety and a failure to recognize reality the kinda fundamental thing that too many people fail to recognize is that change is not made in big sweeping movements or in a rush rather change trickles incrementally through the hard work of people who care and through education at the most fundamental level that is the largest disagreement between many progressives and more centrist democrats and dont even get me started of people calling for revolution
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre forgetting the rationale is well we would be putting in that work but i aint gonna bust my ass to support some lousy centrists
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i always found it strange that bernie supporters were basically telling a woman who had been part of the party for a long time to step aside now that a man was there to do the job and i get that theres much more to it than that but not even addressing that optics issuedonkey in the room was an issue especially to the passionate hillary supporters who already felt like obama had done the same thing to her
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre not wrong but its a product of the twoparty system we have in this country if creating a separate party that was ever going to be competitive was reasonable i think youd see a lot more parties with a lot smaller membership
SubredditDrama,not_removed,naive there is no legitimate or easy way to formalize parties in this nation the only viable method for more progressive politics is through the dnc at the end of the day if a popular movement comes in and replaces them from the bottom up thats legitimate who the hell are you to say that those of us who have no voice in the party entitled fuck outta here with that shit
SubredditDrama,not_removed,and i know im running the risk of conflating your parents political activity experience and knowledge with yours haha aint that the truth there are always meetings to attend nowadays facebook is a good way to catch a line on what the local party is up to but id make sure that you are willing to donate your time its not election season so there isnt any need for knocking on doors but i imagine there are things to be done at your local office whether its something like making a sign volunteering to bring baked goods to a meetup organized protest or whatever it might be early for this but campaigns are always looking for active people to get involved if you go to meetings you might hear someone speak that is looking to get a campaign run together for your area remember local elections can take place every year as for someone who wants to be more politically minded and leftleaning i would highly recommend the podcast pod save america published by three exobama staffers as far as lowlevel involvement dedicate whatever time youre willing to give dont feel bad about only being involved once a month or even less if you go to a local fair or anywhere that has booths like a craft fair or art festival more than likely the political parties will have something set up you can go in and ask the people there when and how to get involved its a good way to meet people facetoface and ask them what it might be like to get more involved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it really depends on the individual most the worst kind refuse to volunteer for things like that but show up to public meetings and open houses and shout about whatever theyre most worried about not to say that their input isnt valued but its not helpful to go to a democratic meeting that is open to the public and say unless you adopt a platform that rejects the proposed school funding levy in im going to protest all of your events and tell everyone i know that youre freezing out citizens from party decisions or whatever else nonsense please be active in politics but choose your battles and people should realize that lobbying your local party is different than lobbying your elected representatives
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well if you run into any of them that are willing to discuss rationally tell them to stop hounding party oldtimers like my dad he is and always has been a leftwing socialist but he understands party politics and what it would mean if his local chapter of democrats actually adopted socialism as the party platform in his rural area and understands that socialism is a fine intellectual ideal but its different when youre talking about specific policies shouting for the common man doesnt help you determine what the rules should be on party procedure or proposed taxes for farm and wild fish should be the point of my original story is that my father got lambasted for being in the democratic party even though he also had a passion for the bernie sanders ideals those bernie people should get involved in the democratic party because people like my dad need their help to figure out the nuance of mixing practicality with those progressive ideals and to get involved because only those who are involved in the democratic party determine policy and people who dont show up for fundraising volunteering voter outreach etc arent involved
SubredditDrama,not_removed,how long can the young turks keep calling themselves that anyway arent they all pushing at this point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nonvoters vastly outnumber swing voters swing voters are about of eligible voters because theyre about of current voters nonvoters are about a platform that brings out nonvoters who are on average more leftwing than the last few democratic platforms is far more likely to succeed than one that focuses on moderates
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he pointed out flaws its rather revisionist to say he trashed her and the party neither one ran a particularly personal campaign so pointing to our own party is stupid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im sorry if someone has a large passionate following with leftist interests whats exactly wrong with some of the agenda getting onto a left partys platform its not bending over backwards for a left party to have left interests its an exaggeration to say some things made it while others didnt but thats in the past election those things werent carried over as party mainstays the democrats are perfectly free to reject bernie and his supporters if theyd like to but thats not what happens they desperately want his email list and they elevated him to the chair of outreach to go out and be a major face representing the party if they are constantly asking sanders for his help in organizing and reaching voters and to be a face asking voters to support the democrats how is it bending over backwards to use some of his ideas
SubredditDrama,not_removed,im not sure why youre putting leftists in quotes the overton window has shifted a ton where republicans are merely seen as right when theyre in fact far right and the dems are centrist right while they do socially liberal views theyre economically more to the right i dont understand why as a poc im asked to sit down and shut up to a party just because theyre better than republicans i really want to support the dems but theyve shown little signs they will fight for my rights is it wrong to feel disenfranchised they feel like theyre owed our votes just because theyre to the left of repubs i voted for hillary i knocked doors for hillary in the midwest because it was practical accepting her faults while remembering donald would be worse but me and a lot of other poc i talked to through the campaign had similar feelings hillary didnt really have our trust with stuff like the crime bill and her foreign policy but we had to vote for her to stop a full blown racist that the party had a partly islamophobic smear campaign against ellison really helped show to me that while the dems wont outright oppress you like the rs they wont support you either when you compromise with someone you shouldnt start out asking for the position youre willing to settle on i want stuff like full blown prison reform a minimum wage and a serious look at racial inequality in the us but while fighting for that i recognize its practical to settle on those demands for say minimum its definitely a flaw of the party right now where they make concessions to the repubs on stuff like the aca without entering the negotiation table
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont understand or didnt bother to look up the process therefore its rigged its totally not my first time voting i swear
SubredditDrama,not_removed,eh i think he ran a pretty classy campaign even if his diehard supporters were delusional
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i gotcha it just sounds like a demon name written without all those vowels yknow
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont think that clinton would have lost if it wasnt rigged but it was still rigged and sanders supporters are right to be pissed about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean it seemed to work well for trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,your facts are the political equivalent of potato i dont need to waste my calculus or liner algebra skills by using them to refute potato in short your facts are not facts and just because you insanely believe them doesnt mean i will waste my time refuting them i would laugh at you but you just arent funny
SubredditDrama,not_removed,plenty of people have disputed your facts as being something other than factual they just happen to also be calling your inability and unwillingness to acknowledge factual reality something akin to truthers who possess the same willing blindness maybe read what people actually write and not simply what you think they wrote
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he started with a huge deficit in name recognition and didnt have enough time to close the gap he also did have serious negatives no doubt about it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of course counterfactuals are impossible to prove but see my comment the way the democratic primary played out is strong evidence that trump would have had a much harder time winning the rust belt against sanders and otherwise the electoral map would have likely been similar people were saying this last spring too and warning the democrats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,shitposting with the srd circlejerk is indeed the easiest thing in the world
SubredditDrama,not_removed,look how clinton turned out lmao you people solely voted for her because shes a woman
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah yes the gop would have called him a communist and he would have lost trump openly brags about committing sexual assault attacks war veterans and gold star families mocks a disabled reporter talks about how big his dick is in a debate then goes on to win the election obviously this was no normal election cycle and the fact that bernies most important primary wins were in the states that gave trump the win is extremely powerful evidence that the result would have been different had sanders won the primary not sure if the dnc not rigging things would have made the difference personally i think he was too far behind in name recognition to win even in a fair primary but it sure didnt help anyone in this country that they did rig it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,which is mostly funny because fdrs populism was a lot more like obamas than like bernies he was derided by his own leftwing for being too soft his policies all halfmeasures and stopgap instead of completely fixing stuff but the bigger issue is that fdr completely reshaped the country politically and democrats won because they were part of that shift and went with it it took decades for republicans to figure out how to be their party in a post fdrage it wasnt just being more liberal wins
SubredditDrama,not_removed,massive gains of what by what metric i gave you plenty of metrics and ill toss the unemployment rate in there yea no shit there was no law to prosecute most of the bankers because people voted for bush and got the financial regulations he campaigned on which were zippity do dah if you cant convince most voters to regulate wall street until the floor falls out of it and then they vote for trump years later then your socialist revolution aint happening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,obama spent the last years trying to explain that the aca isnt spooky socialism to the average american voter and suddenly here comes a democratic socialist bernie sanders who promises he can convince the entire country that his government run single payer healthcare system will get through a gop majority congress and be accepted by the majority of american voters who wont think its socialist at all heres the problem besides the inevitable attacks single payer will get for being socialist did bernie sanders ever explain why single payer failed in his home state of vermont you think the republicans wont bring up the fact that vermont tried to have a single payer system but had to abandon it because it would bankrupt the state yet their senator is going out there claiming it will work for the entire country single payer was also on the ballot in a blue state like colorado and got overwhelmingy rejected why do you think that is its because the majority of americans dont want their taxes raised for a government run program no matter how many times you explain to them it will help them in the long run they simply dont care all they see is more taxes and thats what bernie sanders was proposing that wasnt a major issue during the democratic primaries but would definitely be a problem had he ran in the general
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well he doesnt have a gun but tim canova the guy who tried to primary dws and failed miserably is legit stalking clinton now trying to prove she killed vince foster and that dnc staffer
SubredditDrama,not_removed,those people were just a showpiece to be trotted out at rallies and the like they held no power in the movement
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not gonna lie some of that speculation feels like we miss having more punching bags from the media its pretty easy to make fun of the entire clinton family in one way or another wapo ran some column the other day about how hillary shouldnt dare run in itll be a disaster how selfish of her duh she wasnt planning to as far as anyone can tell she hasnt hinted at it it feels like some people are writing imaginary timelines to get mad at
SubredditDrama,not_removed,hold on were blaming berniecrats for the clintons being a punching bag now not the decades of smear from the right wing not the endless crooked hillary rhetoric from trump and his camp the entire election whats with this trend on the left where its like oh these people who have small ideological differences with me are the evil devil and must be killed while the gop manages to unite internet porn enthusiasts and evangelical christians in one party like can we stop being petty for maybe a hot second maybe no okay
SubredditDrama,not_removed,call me crazy but im not a big fan of these dynasties where every member of the family gets high level positions of power in the government it would be great if she wanted to follow in her parents foot steps to an extent good for her but i think the clintons had their presidency and its time for someone else
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i fucked up got confused by the chain of replies ill come quietly no need for a fuss
SubredditDrama,not_removed,good point
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot of the sanders supporters dont know how to constructively disagree with the rest of the party they seem to have an ass backwards idea of party politics as a whole this idea that the party should earn their votes before they show any good faith effort to support the party is what hurts them voters who will abandon you if not constantly appeased are voters who no one bothers to court american progressives have consistently failed to acknowledge that the democrats cannot move left until the left shows them that it can actually get their asses into the voting booth
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah absolutely i did my point with srd is that theres nothing wrong with srd doing srd things like a prostitute having sex or an ironworker making iron my view is harsh but its not my right to say youre somehow wrong
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i mean i dont know i saw a huge number of people that had voted for clinton and were insanely angry that she lost i cant defend everyone but i know on average shrug they wouldnt have changed the election but they were the symptom and not the disease i guess im partial
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it certainly is fellow kid
SubredditDrama,not_removed,rather change trickles incrementally through the hard work of people who care and through education we spent eight years doing that with obama and now trump is steamrolling through everything he did in a matter of weeks obama wont have any legacy left beyond the spring its likely to be totally wiped out so politics contra weber is no longer about the slow boring of hard boards we are in a very different situation from what is normal and the faster people realize that the better
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bernie called his group our revolution i agree with the guy sometimes but hes doing more harm than good imho
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah they remind me of veruca salt as well
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well it does help to remember that most democratic countries that that claim to have more than two major political parties dont actually have more than two major political parties germany has six major political parties but only two of those parties have ever formed government canada has four majors but only two have ever formed a government the uk has only had two of the three majors form a government in effect those other countries always only have two major parties that anyone thinks has a real chance to form a government using germany as the example the cdu has a formal agreement with the csu for the csu to always play little buddy to the big cdu and while the greens dont have an official agreement with the spd they have much the same relationship with them and no german is under the delusion that the fdp or the left is going to form a national government anytime in the next century they know the chancellor is always going to be a member of either the cdu or the sdp this idea that there as democratic nations with more than two major political parties its not really true not in the sense that people often assume anyway
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thanks a bunch for the reply i was worried i was going to come across in a well what would be the right way according to their high and mighty asses manner what the local party is up to how local do you mean city county metropolitan area or should i just start searching and see what comes up for wherever i am searching for mycity democrats brings up mycounty democrats so i suppose that thats where i should start as for someone who wants to be more politically minded and leftleaning i would highly recommend the podcast pod save america published by three exobama staffers funnily enough ive actually have been listening to pod save america i even have an episode paused from when i last was listening to my podcast app a few hours ago so you could say i am listening to it right now
SubredditDrama,not_removed,there has to be some sort of barrier to enter the party if there isnt this is what you get all of the benefits with no consequences
SubredditDrama,not_removed,absolutely hear you entering the party and working with people facetoface helps you understand the problems and also makes you so much more credible just as it teaches you a lot about how the party works
SubredditDrama,not_removed,misleading statistics nonvoters will not show up to vote full stop youre ignoring years of history democrats had the most liberal platform in ages it didnt help
SubredditDrama,not_removed,he literally called her unfit to be president
SubredditDrama,not_removed,not really he regularly implied that hillary was a wall streetcorporate stooge despite evidence to the contrary and theres also this tweet
SubredditDrama,not_removed,if someone has a large passionate following with leftist interests whats exactly wrong with some of the agenda getting onto a left partys platform nothing but the bernie fans arent happy they moved the needle on the platform theyre angry that they didnt get of what they wanted when they didnt get even of the vote
SubredditDrama,not_removed,bernie called hillary unqualified to be president shortly after that his campaign manager said she sold her soul to the devil within a few weeks of that a that a campaign surrogate started talking about monica lewinsky bernie nor the campaign never ever condemned it bernie basically accused hillary of being a racist and a guy who gave an opening speech at bernies biggest campaign rally used the term democratic whores and none of that is touching on the way he continued acting like it was a close racehe had a shot months after it stopped being true while begging for campaign donations the entire time
SubredditDrama,not_removed,ah well carry on then that said you should probably adjust your big argument post to remove the link about trying to pull the msnbc segment since thats very obviously them asking their media team to get a copy search around the archives and youll see the same thing over and over again you should probably also try and replace the evidence you have of bias right now with stuff that proves bias from a point when it was actually mathematically possible for bernie to still win because it does significant damage to your argument to be complaining about a supposed bias against someone who has already clearly lost
SubredditDrama,not_removed,lol for that
SubredditDrama,not_removed,this is the liberal smugness that is giving us trump
SubredditDrama,not_removed,very few people have done that actually with literally one exception in this entire thread people at best have said wikileaks is a russian conspiracy so we cant trust the emails
SubredditDrama,not_removed,of the first four primaries he won tied or barely lost in three ia nh nv on super tuesday he won oklahoma what do oklahomans and nevadans and iowans know about bernie that the southern states didnt
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i already read it not sure why you think i missed it and its a pretty summary of what happened but thats not the problem youre attacking people for a difference of opinion is yeah they were snarky but you went overboard with insults that make you sound like a child
SubredditDrama,not_removed,counterfactuals jesus this word bleeds smug
SubredditDrama,not_removed,god i love it when popcorn appears on the homefront
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what do you mean you people
SubredditDrama,not_removed,curiously all the wikileaks emails are timestamped after the new york primary election
SubredditDrama,not_removed,obviously this was no normal election cycle and the fact that bernies most important primary wins were in the states that gave trump the win is extremely powerful evidence that the result would have been different had sanders won the primary surprisingly both trump and sanders benefitted greatly from voters negatively impacted by bill clintons policies now the question in the absence of the demon hillary clinton whos going to win over working class rust belt voters more the wealthy con man who talks their language and promises to bring the jobs backtm or the new england professor whos made his hay promising free stuff for college kids
SubredditDrama,not_removed,gop strategist would of made all of that worthless trump openly brags about committing sexual assault bernie dreams of women getting gangraped attacks war veterans and gold star families bernie honeymoons in the ussr im sure middle america would of loved that mocks a disabled reporter bernie wants to dump nuclear waste on minorities and poor people talks about how big his dick is in a debate no one gives a shit about this then goes on to win the election right because if their one thing middle america loves its socialists who defend commies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,fdrs populism was a lot more like obamas than like bernies errrrrrrr what this take is not intuitively obvious in terms of the distance between the starting point and the ending point fdrs populism was left of bernies
SubredditDrama,not_removed,massive opioid abuse rising mental health issues economic security less than half of americans can take a dollar loss right now jobs are still low paying most dont pay healthcare since most cut hours below full time minimum wage is garbage and when hillary cuts fight for fifteen to before the fight started its not a great sign sure the dow recovered and more people are employed but were not in a good spot
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah there are people on reddit too that just dont seem to be able to let go of hating hillary even now shes no longer relevant to anything thats happening
SubredditDrama,not_removed,once you lose at that level you tend not to want to try again but theres always speculation i remember it happening with gore kerry mccain and romney makes sense clinton would get it too
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the huffpost had come out with an opinion piece on why that author thought hillary was a forsure contender in other authors from many sites have been sort of indirectly replying to it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i voted for hillary in the general without a second thought but lets not act like she wasnt responsible for some of that criticism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,american progressives have consistently failed to acknowledge that the democrats cannot move left until the left shows them that it can actually get their asses into the voting booth can i steal that for future use
SubredditDrama,not_removed,voters who will abandon you if not constantly appeased are voters who no one bothers to court then why does the gop listen to the christian right theyve screwed up on every single legal issue and yes the gop pretty much gives them cookies and ice cream this stuff about the voters needing to be accountable to the party and not vice versa runs at right angles to reality american progressives have consistently failed to acknowledge that the democrats cannot move left until the left shows them that it can actually get their asses into the voting booth theres some truth to this but theres a big difference between a faction needs to assert its power at the polls and a faction needs to demonstrate its loyalty to the party bureaucracy look heres whats motivating the irritation about perez being picked over ellison the existing democratic leadership has just lost a presidential election to the most sinister and incompetent person to take that office in a century this is after nearly a decade of poor performance in local elections and incremental capitulation to the gop which now essentially controls all three branches of government despite this bleak overall situation the democratic leadership refuses to take even the most piddling step to move the center of power in the party this has something to do with why the dem leadership is seen as unresponsive its true that all of this could be viewed as realpolitik on their part except that they axed the candidate who was put forward as alternative via a racist and islamophobic whispering campaign fundamentally similar to the truther campaignin this sense theyre actually better tactically speaking at suppressing their own left flank than they are at winning national elections but they only manage that by imitating the gop this kind of stuff is why some progressives see the democratic party as an empty husk
SubredditDrama,not_removed,for future reference iron workers make structures foundry workers cast iron and a miner will mine it
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well a lot of people supported clinton in the primary and the general election as well i was one of those people i liked her a little more than i liked bernie at the time please remember she did defeat sanders in the primaries a lot of the people upset about her getting the second most votes ever as a american presidential candidate only obama got more votes than she did a lot of those people are those who supported her through all the primaries in my view clinton was robbed by an electoral college system that is broken ill leave out weather the ec should exist here but the current electoral college with electors is broken the last time the house of reps was increased in size was in all through the century it was regularly increased in size in part to prevent popular vote losers from being president and that really only happened once in we can ignore because nobody got a majority and we can ignore because the country went with extraconstitutional means to determine the winner with a electoral commission because the house of reps was scared of that mess and with you can at least say it was a super close election less than a vote difference but this time it was a million vote difference that just shouldnt be allowed and to make matters worse nobody is interested in trying to fix this situation the republicans are happy to get fewer votes and declare themselves the winner as if was a fdr or reagan sized land slide and theyre not even embarrassed by it when i was growing up the idea of a president winning election while losing the popular vote was something only discussed as a technically possibility but so unlikely that it could never really happen now in the last five elections we have had two situations where the loser of the popular vote won the white house something that only happened once in the first years of the countries existence is now considered normal
SubredditDrama,not_removed,we spent eight years doing that with obama and now trump is steamrolling through everything he did in a matter of weeks obama wont have any legacy left beyond the spring its likely to be totally wiped out talk to us again in two months when the republicans file off the serial numbers from the aca and swear up and down its repeal and replace
SubredditDrama,not_removed,exhibit a
SubredditDrama,not_removed,a lot of stuff is going to stick unless the administrative procedure act is repealed which i doubt will happen
SubredditDrama,not_removed,years is not long
SubredditDrama,not_removed,in one priming men with a question about gender roles in this case whether they make more or less money than their wife and then asking them who they planned on voting for produced an enormous affect on the outcome the effects of the gender role threat question are enormous as figure shows men who werent asked about spousal income until after being asked about the presidential election preferred clinton over trump to however those who were reminded about the threat to gender roles embodied by clinton preferred trump over clinton to concerns about gender role threat shifted men from preferring clinton by to preferring trump by a point shift
SubredditDrama,not_removed,saying stuff like this just plays into the hands of the bernie supporters who said hillary and her supporters thought she deserved to be president simply because she was a woman im sorry but i dont understand this you say that saying stuff like this plays into the hands of bernie supporters while completely dismissing the same criticism from hillary supporters ie they felt she was being asked to step aside because she was a woman and there was a man to take her place you cant have it both ways you cant dismiss one while coddling the other
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well it does help to remember that most democratic countries that that claim to have more than two major political parties dont actually have more than two major political parties germany has six major political parties but only two of those parties have ever formed government canada has four majors but only two have ever formed a government the uk has only had two of the three majors form a government in the case of the uk thats just factually wrong the tories had to negotiate a coalition with the lib dems to form government in the australian government has also been formed with minor party representatives greens and independent reps recently however this is just missing the point in the american system there is no way for smaller parties to enter the system at all they remain totally powerless but if we had a seat dreams in australia minor parties can prove themselves by holding power in the senate and house actually voting on things and use their parliamentary powers to do things like ask questions at senate estimates comittees it also tempers the minor parties because they have to actually deal with the reality of having political power compare jill stein with httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvybzzirsrbwq with legitimized third parties and preferential voting people angry at labor can voice their dissent by voting greens without sabotaging the chance for any leftwing politicians to get in at all likewise rightwingers can vote for one nation or independents like jacqui lambie instead of libnats
SubredditDrama,not_removed,searching for mycity democrats brings up mycounty democrats so i suppose that thats where i should start yup party organization is typically organized by county state national ive actually have been listening to pod save america cool yeah its a great combination of entertaining and informative
SubredditDrama,not_removed,that bottom tweet is gold lol we dont consider msm info factual from march its crazy that shit had taken root that far back
SubredditDrama,not_removed,youre arguing against an imaginary person here remember that reddit isnt real life doesnt comprise bernies whole base and neither does td comprise donalds whole base
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats not all that people have said but i wont interrupt your tantrumcumcoping mechanism
SubredditDrama,not_removed,southern states have a much lower internet penetration and most of the bernie talk wasnt in traditional media but digital
SubredditDrama,not_removed,but you went overboard with insults that make you sound like a child im merely disagreeing with the circlejerk and that in srd makes people more angry than anything else imaginable im not insulting people im giving back as much snark as i get
SubredditDrama,not_removed,literally an srd user calling someone smug just because theyre smarter
SubredditDrama,not_removed,what about the word counterfactual is smug
SubredditDrama,not_removed,curiously all the wikileaks emails are timestamped after the new york primary election lets check held on april til march is later than april this conspiracy is very curious indeed
SubredditDrama,not_removed,sanders was talking their language and promising to bring jobs back as well remember their economic pitch wasnt that dissimilar trade in particular
SubredditDrama,not_removed,nobody gives a shit about the ussr anymore and bernie doesnt dream of women getting gangraped this stuff could have convinced the people who were never going to vote democratic in a million years which means it would have had no impact on the election the fact that retroactively everyones now like oh all the horrible things trump said makes sense that nobody cared now when at the time they were screaming thats it for trump for the hundredth time shows that politics is different now and youre being left behind
SubredditDrama,not_removed,please read our side bar and follow the rules do not insult others
SubredditDrama,not_removed,at what point in time could they take a dollar lose at what point in time was there more coverage for mental health issues httpswwwmentalhealthgovgethelphealthinsurance the opioid abuse ill give you
SubredditDrama,not_removed,two people dead what are you talking about
SubredditDrama,not_removed,i dont know if this is because of how much they hate hillary or because they need whatever reason they can get to justify supporting trump and the but hillary argument is all they can muster
SubredditDrama,not_removed,kind of impossible to rise and fall based on merit considering we only know her name because of her parents
SubredditDrama,not_removed,it doesnt resonate with them despite enough empirical evidence to fill an encyclopedia they think that this time is different theyd rather cut their noses off and play victim than make progress they arent entirely on board with
SubredditDrama,not_removed,would you mind explaining how progressives havent been voting im genuinely not trying to argue but i am slightly baffled im a progressive who voted obama in twice
SubredditDrama,not_removed,then why does the gop listen to the christian right because the christian right votes they get what they want because they have shown that they would vote for the rotten corpse of karl marx if it came out against abortion that is the problem you are looking at this backwards the christian right votes and so their votes are worth pursuing the left does not vote even when they are given what they want but theres a big difference between a faction needs to assert its power at the polls and a faction needs to demonstrate its loyalty to the party bureaucracy not a real difference loyalty is valuable because democracy is a marathon not a sprint there is no point in giving a demographic what they want in one election if once they have it they will stop caring this is why the party listens to moderates because the moderates have shown they are willing to fall in line when the time comes that is how party politics works you fight over your platform then you work together to implement the compromise if one faction refuses to do the second part unless they get everything they want in the first that faction will get ignored the dnc does not ignore their left flank they have just learned that they cannot rely on it in they might hand you a landslide only to vanish off the face of the earth in and building a coalition on progressives in america is building your house on quicksand the left cannot constantly flake out on elections and expect the party to still focus on their issues
SubredditDrama,not_removed,the fact that perez of all people is seen as imitating the gop and a capitulation to racism is one of the weirdest cases of goalpost moving ive ever seen in my life
SubredditDrama,not_removed,o fuk i done goofed well ok like steamfitters installing pipes then its the coin of this world and it doesnt really hurt anyone outside because this isnt srs its selfcontained
SubredditDrama,not_removed,yeah and i mean its not like media favoritism was the only thing that killed him superdelegates not being wellknown redbaiting actual socialism in a currentday environment unfriendly to moreobamacare re the ec ive been helping out here and there with campaigns to get the npvic passed go look it up set up a wordpress campaign for it if its not already in your state
SubredditDrama,not_removed,well its fair to say that their rush to ditch obamacare has kind of fucked them i think i dont know whats going to happen there but all those eos obama put out are being repealed pretty quickly and paul ryan is gearing up for a farright legislative agenda where the gop controls both houses of congress
SubredditDrama,not_removed,wow its amazing the degree of impact small things can have really brings home just how complex it can be to answer the question of why trump won
SubredditDrama,not_removed,thats really fucking sad
