TheSilphRoad,removed,fine with me nidorina is superior
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow that would be a real kick in the arse for rural players no public transport and no local delivery
TheSilphRoad,removed,til porygon he chansey she snorlax he
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i have a distinct feeling that i just got screwed out of of the free incubators i spun my first stop at est unaware that dec doesnt mean today yetapparently im fairly perturbed
TheSilphRoad,removed,again someone who cannot think please start using your brain for a change okay
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one forced us playing this game agreed however by doing so we entered a social and many of us business relationship with the company this is a twoway street and with that comes responsibilities for both sides both morally and legally by the way with them offering certain treats and then not delivering the underlying expectation this is a problem one that they apparently cannot sufficiently address by communicating better
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not a real gift of you have to buy it
TheSilphRoad,removed,is this a joke im very disappointed cheaper to buy incubators straight up
TheSilphRoad,removed,is we allow you to buy yourself presents a new way to celebrate christmas
TheSilphRoad,removed,be sure to drink your ovaltine
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow seriously thats terrible we have the right to be mad about this one
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip people who spun their first pokestop last night
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope
TheSilphRoad,removed,ridiculous how they said a spin after first spin of the day gave an incubator afterall its only the first spin of the day so i just lost a free incubator
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy crap seriously cmon niantic thats kinda lame
TheSilphRoad,removed,or they could give out incubators after the first stop of the day like they said they would might make me more inclined to spend on the boxes
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you dumb i have coins to buy multiple of these my bag is not at i also do care because im home all day for christmas so im hemorrhaging balls as there are many spawn points here but no stops in range of my house
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats nothing but stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah wtf we are being punished for playing too much
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic always manage to disappoint half of their players somehow
TheSilphRoad,removed,i spoof and i didnt get banned so no
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should not have done that first they release the babies without giving out incubators and now the gifts cost coins they are trying to get every single cent out of the players they also ruined many peoples espectations by not saying the events starting time
TheSilphRoad,removed,agree with this sentiment
TheSilphRoad,removed,goddammit niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,or they did think about it and just didnt really care
TheSilphRoad,removed,spent coins yesterday on incubators and went out at utc to spin for the day so thanks to not knowing what the boxes would contain or that niantic would screw up the event start i have doubly missed out
TheSilphRoad,removed,i lost out by about half an hour im really peeved by that
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic are so inept at everything why make it only drop on the first spin basically punishing anyone who dare play the game at christmas rather than reward them
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah a christmas event that does not start on christmas morning unless you live on hawaii after my kids spent the coins they got for christmas they are depressed now thanks for nothing niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,you wont get any extra they are punishing us for being active if we had not spun the pokestop in the morning we would have got one too now
TheSilphRoad,removed,or they could give the free ones like promised you know either way
TheSilphRoad,removed,after seeing this i wrote the price on everybodys presents under the tree if they want them theyre going to have to buy them from me great idea niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic being utterly inept whod have thought
TheSilphRoad,removed,calm down its just one incubator one of many to come no need to cry about it i spun one at midnight so i didnt get one today no big deal
TheSilphRoad,removed,wellthats dissapointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats crappy
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol who would want a ghastly at this point halloween event had so many that if people dont have at least with high ivs all evolved into gengars with good moves then they need to learn how to play the game i think i caught like gengars during that event and i had before the event
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is the santa claus in a christmas story and everyone who spun a stop when they woke up christmas morning is ralphy getting kicked in the face
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing i need really if we at least get a discount on perma items pokemonslotsinventory but paying for incubators is just not fun for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,whelp looks like niantic has grinchmode turned on this is so mean to anyone that is in another timezone why dont they just put a one time per day icon in the shop to give the gift
TheSilphRoad,removed,man this event is awful an unannounced sale that started well after first thing in the am coin collection time the announced incubators started too late for basically everyone in the world on christmas day since they only come with the first spin bonus and egg drops have an increased chance of useless pokemon about the only positive is picachu is everywhere raichu is a solid trainer and the pikachu medal is tough
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi got absolutely nil today has the holiday event started in the uk
TheSilphRoad,removed,man thats terrible that they tied the free incubator to the first spin of the day without telling anyone what time the event would start they really should have been able to program it to give out incubators still for people who havent received their free one yet and already spun their first stop
TheSilphRoad,removed,how stupid do you have to be to both not tell the exact time that the event starts and not award incubators for people who already spun their first pokestop it was for me when they finally started giving incubators it seems i honestly believed they are smarted than this
TheSilphRoad,removed,the biggest babies in the world play this game 🙄
TheSilphRoad,removed,or they figured people would be smart enough to wait for the event to start before expecting free things
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just want to say thank you to niantic for a proper use case of how not to run a global event
TheSilphRoad,removed,sad and crap
TheSilphRoad,removed,next time just take seconds to read through here first there were immediate reports when the incubators were live and there were tons of reports from people that didnt get any up to that point
TheSilphRoad,removed,yupsucky christmas giftnone and my store doesnt work to buy special gifts eitherguess i am super specialnianticnot at all happy with your christmas nongift
TheSilphRoad,removed,that sucks damn i should have waited
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just spun my first of the day hours ago well what a nice start of the event
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant believe they would minor hype us up for this event and then punish us for spinning their own pokestopsthat they keep on seeming to promote with sponsored stops and the new tracker do they want us to use them or not at least give us a time or explain clearly that you cant spin any stops before
TheSilphRoad,removed,this sucks we did our first spin of the day at est and no incubators how late do west coasters sleep in on christmas i figured it would just give you one whenever your next stop was after the event i never have balls so i have to spin pokestops when we go past them cant afford to miss them
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you wanted to show incenses are useful you could have used something else than a pretty common and generally not very useful poke
TheSilphRoad,removed,hahahaha its already the in my region when the event starts wtf man
TheSilphRoad,removed,why niantic is bad at everything other than squeezing money out of people
TheSilphRoad,removed,like said if you multiple that by million users they just saved a bunch of money lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i will never understand why they dont give an official start time when they know the official start time its so stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic and their stupid decisions was it too hard to give the incubator at the very first pokestop spin on the event started at of the in my country was i supposed to stay the day without spinning pokestops
TheSilphRoad,removed,how this xmas event was handled just confirms why nintendo stock was a short for the past week
TheSilphRoad,removed,please post this crap on pokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol i swear niantic devs are script kiddies p
TheSilphRoad,removed,apparently i should have ignored every single pokestop until to be able to get the bonus incubatorwtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,spin it now the event started the same time for everyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,so meta
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is insane
TheSilphRoad,removed,its more the fact that niantic are so lazy or incompetent to get such simple things wrong
TheSilphRoad,removed,doesnt feel like a present when i have to buy it and already know whats inside lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,the word gyped in this context is offensive to gypsies who would have also taken some of your money prior to gyping you
TheSilphRoad,removed,a gift is something different from money value it feels good to receive something not expected
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantics stupidity at its best
TheSilphRoad,removed,so if you spon a stop before the event started you basically lose out on incubator thanks a lot niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,totally agreed on their last point i missed it too but i was over it in minutes the problem i have is their communication actually regressed this event after being nearly nonexistent previously without ranting too hard ill just say that they are living on pokemon name recognition and on game recognition as is going to need some changes if they dont want to alienate their player base
TheSilphRoad,removed,ooh arent you such a big man with those downvotes im soooooo scared
TheSilphRoad,removed,nobody cares
TheSilphRoad,removed,its beyond unacceptable that they said that youd get an incubator with your first spin of the day starting on christmas and then didnt bother to follow through on that if youre in the wrong time zone
TheSilphRoad,removed,quick everyone apply for it
TheSilphRoad,removed,pfft no not for a spearow those things arent hard to find
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive switched phones since the us beta began because i have shit luck with tech and theyve all let me use my account i didnt drop them they were just all faulty
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i have a question why make this post asking for questions and then wait hours and not answer any of them are you just an attention whore or what
TheSilphRoad,removed,its for using the search feature before you post
TheSilphRoad,removed,when you do it against your own team its a dick move why because you should be loyal to a arbitrary color you picked two months ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,how do you scan areas like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,also tfw you just threw your phone out the window because a rapidash has the worst moveset fuckniantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is also now an option to order or and ship internationally we know shipping costs can be high so this is a good option if any of our international travelers want to order together to bring the cost down nbsp how is this an option this is the illusion of an option tsr is a niche community that very few are aware of especially in my play group ive been involved since the first access codes went out and i do my best to get other people to come over but i end up just regurgitating information as its all a little daunting nbsp also how would it be exclusive if everyone i know has one especially when they have one just so i can have one nbsp poorly handled imo
TheSilphRoad,removed,omg thanks for this important post
TheSilphRoad,removed,i considered that especially when i saw it move from lvl when the account first showed up at the top of a gym to lvl about a week later iirc the username was
TheSilphRoad,removed,in out in out in out ive had similar experience with a girl
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive asked you mum yesterday night and she said she doesnt surf reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry im not american but was that guy a bad cop i thought that a good american cop would have shot you to death
TheSilphRoad,removed,bro she wants the g
TheSilphRoad,removed,you all on here have been wrong so many times can we stop with the posts speculating about updaterelease dates
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,we continue to focus on eliminating bots and scrapers from pokémon go rooted or jailbroken devices are not supported by pokémon go is this new my phone is rooted because i own it i dont need more reasons to not play
TheSilphRoad,removed,umm will the game no longer work on rooted phones thats a horrible change
TheSilphRoad,removed,you literally just made up numbers
TheSilphRoad,removed,still no update on appstore ios minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,funny thingios is on not this update says it will be for ios think i smell a ratata
TheSilphRoad,removed,probably because it is not a problem normally delt wkth
TheSilphRoad,removed,you keep saying im right and i keep saying its not an argument i resorted to criticisms because advice want having any impact this is the last time ill say it all you care about is winning even if no one else is even participating in the argument with you
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would prefer minor bot fixes instead of minor text fixes as it was the last time their ban waves are so rare
TheSilphRoad,removed,still no tracking system the very core of the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,still no mass transfer
TheSilphRoad,removed,but continuing to crack down on the kind people that do create party working trackers for us all
TheSilphRoad,removed,they had it right on the first day
TheSilphRoad,removed,not for gorillas
TheSilphRoad,removed,dicksoutforslakoth
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy balls
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy balls
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,they dont want us to download the apk apkmirror im looking at you but they dont allow a nexus to download the game from playstore it does run the game decently while some crap tablets that can download the game barely can run it really niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah why dont you upload the apk and share it
TheSilphRoad,removed,the tracker isnt going to change get used to it sorry
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly id rather they take their time and get it right again not to sound negative but they certainly didnt do that with the launch of the game i agree though
TheSilphRoad,removed,fastpokemaps goradar they count as scrapers i mean i hope not its a major part of playing pokemon for me at the moment
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally the update i wanted minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one got time for that
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor text fixes but no r im skeptical about this update
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive fallen away from pokemon go in recent weeks like despite being a rather passive app to play there was a period where i was just not bothered even opening it gonna give it another chance with this update befoe i look into deleting it
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,downvotes for the downvote god
TheSilphRoad,removed,its really absurd that niantic makes a pokemon region exclusive and then doesnt even give it a chance of spawning in many parts of the region source south florida no tauros in south or central florida
TheSilphRoad,removed,wht about the tracker did i miss it
TheSilphRoad,removed,was able to play right before the update after i was greeted with this message upon opening the app please note that i havent done anything to hide root yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor
TheSilphRoad,removed,waiting for the playstore update some people said they cant connect after downloading the apk from apkmirror im not entirely sure how apps check if my phone is rooted so i still have hope that it will run after downloading update from store my didnt reinstall a different os so there is that too i know there are easy ways around it but if i cant play with a rooted android im dropping this game just because i dont like the direction niantic are taking with that
TheSilphRoad,removed,noooooooo
TheSilphRoad,removed,useful for being mislead or misleading others
TheSilphRoad,removed,why is it aviable on apk before it is on playstore
TheSilphRoad,removed,root cloak doesnt work fml time to try my stock zenfone but i hear its showing up as rooted on some apps
TheSilphRoad,removed,apkmirror
TheSilphRoad,removed,no pokemon go for rooted devices god damn thats awfull
TheSilphRoad,removed,yo
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant get into the game my phone is rooted ofc damn niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,if niantic never said before today that rooted or jailbroken phones are not allowed to be used with pokemon go they will almost certainly soon have a class action lawsuit on their hands from rooted users who have happily used this app for weeks with no expectation that a rooted or jailbroken phone was a problem who now cant use the app and spent money on the app on the reasonable expectation that they wouldnt be locked out from it i dont think niantic realizes quite what theve done here
TheSilphRoad,removed,no tracker yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,unbelievable lol well it was a fun game while it lasted no way am i going back to the horribly slow and bloated stock note software
TheSilphRoad,removed,it kinda shows a disconnect fromlack of understanding of their userbase people root to remove bloatware and oc their processors so older phones can play pokemon go not so they can cheat you dont need a rooted phone for that
TheSilphRoad,removed,with this move they are just losing even more players and pushing developers to write even more exploiting apps while i understand the reason behind this a lot of users have a rooted phone to fix official rom bugs increase internal memory remove bloatware and be able to backup appsdata no way they are going to unroot their device just to play pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,too bad so sad rooted is just for convience
TheSilphRoad,removed,i tried a hide root exposed module with but no luck guess i might have to drop the game then
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank god i didnt root lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,this has to be the most idiotic thing that niantic has ever done they have no idea how many people have rooted their android phone for legit reasons i think this may be around well done youre going to lose a lot of players lets just hope someone gets a root cloak working
TheSilphRoad,removed,nexus user here also but havent received the update yet this has me seriously consider quitting pokemon i use root for so many things not sure what to do right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah but its unreasonable because i dont get what i want
TheSilphRoad,removed,far i would argue that i have no doubt it opens up options but thats like saying people only use the internet for scaning so we shouldnt let them be tempted or people write their own books to spread dogma so lets remove that option from them its just a wrong line of thought but i can kind of see where it comes from
TheSilphRoad,removed,should is subjective i appreciate the silph maps and all the data analysis the dev team is doing but most people are using the maps to report good pokemon so other players can find them as well pokemon considered good in their area anyway one mans drowzee is another mans spearow finding pokemon is primarily what the maps are used for even if data is an honorable goal and i know personally when i pass by a cluster spawn im prone to prioritize the onyx over the ratatta and pidgeys
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really wish niantic would not waste dev time on petty stuff like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,not every single thing is a psa this entire freaking sub has become littered with followed by something mundane or something thats more of a lpt
TheSilphRoad,removed,device not supported after update wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,congrats niantic i quit until you revert this
TheSilphRoad,removed,i also absolutely do not understand this imagine a pc game that would only run if your user does not have admin rights how retarded would that be spoofers will find a way around this anyway because the xposed framework exists personally i couldnt care less about people who willingly relinquish the fun they could have with this game by spoofing pissing off thousands of innocent users just to hinder one person from cheating really doesnt seem much reasonable
TheSilphRoad,removed,gonna bet their analytic guy told them that rooting was an element of behavior for botting and scraping
TheSilphRoad,removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of hour to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete id dont forget to add the time options after the of
TheSilphRoad,removed,thing is im going to bet there is a lot of overlap between people who are technically sophisticated enough to root and people who are technically sophisticated enough to run bots and scrapers
TheSilphRoad,removed,i got to lvl during the first two weeks and am currently taking a breaklurking while i wait for some kind of tracking mechanism to return i did this on my xperia s using root and a custom rom from xdadevelopers as official support died during android i guess this means goodbye so peace late
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol a bypass was already made before the update was even released worldwide gg
TheSilphRoad,removed,just wonder how about apps that allow player to play the hacked version of the game because the phone doesnt even need to be rootedjailbroken right my friend told me hes been using this kind of app and he is still fine now
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic always do stupid things in order to ban cheater last time they implement soft ban which blocks certain ips
TheSilphRoad,removed,that really sucks there are lots of legitimate reasons for rooting your phone
TheSilphRoad,removed,rooted or jailbroken devices are not supported by pokémon go that really really sucks there are legitimate reasons for rooting phones fighting bots is not a sufficient reason for suddenly excluding a lot of honest players
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok so i bought a few coins in the beginning and now i am no longer allowed to play the game after an update that sounds really not ok really not ok any idea where we all could complain it might be harder to ignore us if we are a significant number of people
TheSilphRoad,removed,it also creates a dangerous situation where people who enjoy cm which has no problem with allowing root are basically going against niantic and could be banned for it
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre not necessarily wrong though im sure the amount of people playing with rooted or jailbroken devices is larger than you think but the problem here is that they have applied a sweeping fix that will undoubtedly affect a considerable amount of legit players rootingjailbreaking is not always done for the sake of cheating or getting past pay walls there are loads of innocent practical aspects to device modification that attract even casual users performance boosters better os roms deeper device customization etc i know many people who look to their tech savvy friends to jailbreak an iphone for them who probably couldnt even tell you what spoofing is and while some people do probably use illegal versions of other apps through rootingjailbreaking it doesnt necessarily mean theyre interested in cheating on pokemon go at any rate i hope they find a better way to stop botters either way it probably will always be a cat and mouse thing as someone mentioned elsewhere in this thread
TheSilphRoad,removed,well thats one way to get rid of gps spoofers
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongo leaking again i see
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have no issue with and but i have an issue with far more players with rooted phones are playing legit than being bottersspoofers which i would think should be the case my assumption no proof if there are botters among people without root but among people with root you would have more botters in proportion among root population but should you really block the legit people to try to neutralize the that seems completely messed up
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel like is way wrong i think most of the bottingspoofing is being done on pcs but i could be wrong it seems like it wouldnt be a big issue for them to recode to appear to be unrooted
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not even rooted just on and am getting it this is bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,yay i just need twice more km i made until today to have one fking evo which will have siht moveset anyways
TheSilphRoad,removed,its unreasonable to protect their game experience for the vast majority of players by blocking a niche software change that is used to exploit their game
TheSilphRoad,removed,getting authentication failure not even botted or gps spoofed or anything in this account im honestly about to give up on this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think you highly underestimate the amount of legitimate players with root like said there are so many legit use cases of root browsing through your phones complete filesystem backing up your apps overclockingundervolting or changing your vibration or camera led strength to name a few the percentage of players who have their phones rooted might not exactly be large but i believe the percentage of spoofers is still extremely low in comparison
TheSilphRoad,removed,yay d no more performanceoptimised devices very well done niantic also some stuff may stop working like memory editors and certain bots
TheSilphRoad,removed,triggered
TheSilphRoad,removed,cheaters of any kind wont be able to enjoy the content until they get their workaround in place every patch like this gives us a period of no cheating then only dedicated cheating still low then eventually you get back to a pretty high amount but some cheaters will give up and start playing legit to avoid the trouble so its overall a good thing to put walls up after each patch
TheSilphRoad,removed,about of android users root even if only that stat sticks for pogo why alienate of your market
TheSilphRoad,removed,take that cheaters
TheSilphRoad,removed,thousands of people slightly inconvenienced vs the game ruined for tens of millions yeah id take that deal in a heartbeat
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would like to extend a call to arms to anyone with a custom os or rooted phone on monday i will be doing a chargeback on any and all purchases made through the shop this fraudulent behavior is not acceptable if we get enough people they will lose their visa license chargeback rate must always be below or something like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,also waiting to hear this pokepatch has worked for me through the previous updates but im nervous that theyll have upped their game with this update and it wont work anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,worst devs ever just lost a paying customer requesting google refund for invested
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this is not solved consider another player lost in me cu
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know i believe having and android device without root access is pointless so if niantic is going to be that hard on us well ill stop playing a lot of people including myself wont be unrooting just to play a darn game thats just plain stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank god rooted players and jailbroken players cant connect if you cant use the phone the right way you should be able to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that sucks was actually looking forward to this update but the devs seem to love putting nails in the casket of this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats great that youve walked that much most people have jobs and other responsibilities though this just shows how terrible niantic are at gamedev
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats right and niantic doesnt care banniantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,makes no sense to mee tho from all the rooted devices out there playing pokemon go a small subset of those would be cheating so youre punishing so much of your user base to stop some botters
TheSilphRoad,removed,have they still not added a better way to track pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,you dont apply this reasoning to something as elemental as root and jailbreak this is as ham fisted as disallowing iphone users because theres a cheaty companion app in the app store
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you serious i blame niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,every whos rooted and has spent money should put in requests for refunds
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i can get past it easy likely wont bother
TheSilphRoad,removed,this doesnt actually stop spoofers and botters like at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a terrible company
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wish i could downvote you at least times
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank u nianticfor making me ditching this game once and for allfarawell
TheSilphRoad,removed,perhaps you should plan to quit the game until niantic decides to make these goals achievable every time this company does something dumb we think it cant get any worse then it does
TheSilphRoad,removed,you honestly think niantic will find a good solution when it seems that every time that they are given a problem they have always picked the easiest solution with no thought for the consequences games success results in servers being overloaded nerf the game rather than spending the unexpected profits on improving the servers people start using the games api to develop their own replacements for the disabled tracking lock out party use of the api rather than fix the tracking it was replacing a tiny number of users are hacking prevent a much larger group from even playing the game rather than work on any kind of way to identify the actual hackers niantic have no business calling themselves developers because this game has actually regressed since its release i hate to invoke godwins law but im really glad these people arent in politics or theyd be implementing a truly hitlerian response to problems in society through their unwillingness to deal with difficult problems in anything but the most ignorant kneejerk lazy manner
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you serious unable to authenticate is a ban message wow just wow they are going to ban people for rootingjailbreaking their phones
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wouldnt put it past niantic they just did an apple keynote
TheSilphRoad,removed,who are you kidding niantic doesnt care about their players
TheSilphRoad,removed,it really sucks stupid idea to punish everyone even those who play fairly because they cannot found a way to counter cheaters i had very low faint in niantic before that didnt thought they could fall any lower but they just did
TheSilphRoad,removed,if youre quitting because of this make sure you demand a refund for any bought items
TheSilphRoad,removed,i tried using clean uninstall option and it sat there for and no progress really dont want to go through flashing my entire phone again
TheSilphRoad,removed,they check the trip counter lol they did it guys they finally killed pokemon go what a nightmare
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic thinks everyone is a cheater judge jury executioner im not spending a dollar on this game until there are major changes
TheSilphRoad,removed,im rooted and have never botted or spoofed you have no evidence to support your claims either why should i be unable to use the new update for risk of being unable to play i damn sure cant afford to buy another phone just for pogo im surprised so many people are just fine victim blaming here
TheSilphRoad,removed,according to niantic you are a cheater this is the final nail in the coffin
TheSilphRoad,removed,to all you cheaters and hackers crying that niantic wont let you play from jail with your phonestoo bad you did the crime do the time phones are supposed to be illegal in jail btw cry less and focus on rebuilding your life
TheSilphRoad,removed,lots of pokémon and pokémon go players are quite geeky and are into tech and stuff most people like that would probably buy an android phone and in my case rooting is a wonderful solution to all those small niggling things you want to tinker with rooting doesnt make you a cheat this is like being islamophobic because many terrorists the media shoe are muslim of course a far less serious issue but hey
TheSilphRoad,removed,eat a bag of dicks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,eat a bag of dicks niantic ive been a loyal fan and evangelist of this game since the start of july and now on top of all the bullshit youre gonna do me like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh bloody hell and i was just enjoying my excitement at this update go shaft yourself niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn so many spoofers crying haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,enjoy losing your userbase niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,what exactly is that minimal requirement for how do you completely remove supersu im getting secure booting error after flashing it
TheSilphRoad,removed,its messed up that we cant have a rooted android or jailbroken ios its our phone and can do what we want with it games should not dictate what we can do with something we purchased just because that community can get a bad wrap doesnt mean everybody is malicious
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic for thinking their ecosystem is so important they can screw over their user base the only time ive not been rooted was when it wasnt known how for my phone since my true opinion gets caught by the automod this is the equivilent of banning printers because you can print money
TheSilphRoad,removed,anybody know where to complain to niantic i want to give them a good yelling
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey buddy no need to be pedantic im just trying to say the rates for dratini arent really worth it in my opinion but feel free to do it whatever way you want
TheSilphRoad,removed,and saved thank you
TheSilphRoad,removed,so sorry you were born without a brain
TheSilphRoad,removed,not sure why this post was deleted the op explained how awesome it was to make pokémongo run at lower resolutions for battery life and for fps of actual gameplay this post was spot on and shouldnt have been deleted it should have been upvoted to the top
TheSilphRoad,removed,whelp its been real but this is where i uninstall
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just restored from a backup to get the old version back i never once cheated looks like theyre using this version to find rooted people and ban them indiscriminately
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope it works for you all im not rooted if it works thoi hope you still leave your complaint in the app store ratings i feel its the only way our respectful concerns will be addressed
TheSilphRoad,removed,even developers at niantic dont use instinct for testingsorry instinct
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can reduce of crime by putting everyone in prison
TheSilphRoad,removed,make sure you leave a review about it in the app store
TheSilphRoad,removed,so no proper tracking yet great
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah thats why the didnt initially stop people from playing with it cheaters ruin the fun for everyone im just glad i didnt root my phone though my carriers stuff definetly impacts my device performance easiest option would be too just get a second device that is pokemon go only every carrier gives data sims now and who doesnt have an extra phone laying around
TheSilphRoad,removed,danger will robinson danger
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you had a brain in your dumb head then you would understand that this is completely worthless its actually worse than if it wasnt even in the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,while researching pokemon go root i came across an article that says nonroot hacks exist and work with the new update way to go niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is total bs
TheSilphRoad,removed,is this the equivalent of prepatch shitposts d
TheSilphRoad,removed,im bored ive been screwing with idiots for days now all this work you guys put into the comments is cute
TheSilphRoad,removed,i clicked this just so that i could downvote because some reason you cant on the home page google is there for a reason and most of the apps do it
TheSilphRoad,removed,stfu
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have to joint the whining here out of my first eggs i do not keep a record of each only know the total from the game internal statistics page i hatched snorlax and lapras so i thought that investigation result of out of eggs for one lapras is quite matching to my own results but now hatching reach which means another eggs hached but of which i got only one lapras and non snorlax at all i just feel so bad about hatching now but at the same time by using pokemesh and pokestumple i caught snorlax and lapras from wild so is pokemon go actually reading my game data and then balancing this kind of different resources to let me not to have more snorlax or lapras
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is exactly the flaw in your argument youre just going to dissuade new players from ever partaking in the gym system if you have a system that is so inaccessible being slow should not prevent you from participating im not trying to dissuade you from participating per se just a bringing into your attention that this particular gym is a drain of your time and resources and there probably are greener pastures somewhere else b if you are still fully commited to take it its fine i can respect that but its on you dont ask for a system that rewards being stubborn for stubborness sake theres nothing special on that the spot going for whoever added the most prestige is absolutly logical from any perspective
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope youll need to chip in an additional for the pogo
TheSilphRoad,removed,nintendo as far as im able to tell made about of them and then stopped were all waiting to see when the next will roll off the assembly line and hit stores amazon might have a small restock on the but we dont know if stores will as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpswwwnianticlabscomtermspokemongoen im betting you actually havent ever read the tos
TheSilphRoad,removed,nintendo only thinks about japan apparently
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know mate its not really the spirit i am near a dratini nest i just follow them as they run for them itspretty fun here its right on the saigon river mekong everyone stops on their motorbikes ill take some pics
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use pokemesh regularly and ive had it since the day it was made they update it a lot but i love it
TheSilphRoad,removed,he was definitely being sarcastic s lives matter
TheSilphRoad,removed,rng is an excuse for lack of skill both on the player and the developer if you have to roll a die to determine an outcome you havent made a game youve made a monstrosity
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes done result random
TheSilphRoad,removed,current has a wide range of uses my os is current and im currently pooping
TheSilphRoad,removed,your data is based on people knowing this simple fact since its not mentioned anywhere on the report sighting page you have no way of knowing how many people actually followed this rule so your data is unreliable adding a field for time of the sighting will allow you to only extract data points for reports within the relevant time frame and ignore other reports for analysis purposes while still showing them on the map for the benefit of your users this will increase accuracy of your data
TheSilphRoad,removed,to be fair im not a highlevel trainer just barely hitting level well thats it lvl is extremely low
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i have no experience with manouevring level training i only just achieved a perfect cp cp magikarp training mechanism just evolved my first twister gyrados too so fuck that
TheSilphRoad,removed,we get a large number of i cant set the time mod messages daily
TheSilphRoad,removed,i recorded myself taking a gym from to a couple nights ago you can spot the moment i go ok fuck it im just spamming dragonites somewhere through the middle of the thing and thats when it dawned on me that i was wasting my time with type advantages when i could have just forced a lot of those fights with my main dragonites i still like to mix it up here and there but that was the day i had the sad realization that dragonite can just brute force everything except fairy and ice types efficiently i think that i never noticed because i had mostly used them as defenders for coins up to that point
TheSilphRoad,removed,anytime i go to adler or any other hot spot almost everyone has goradar or a tab open to fpm monitoring the other nearby spots this is the only place ive ever seen people hating on scanners
TheSilphRoad,removed,so in essence let pretty much everyone else in your team do all the hard work of attacking gyms and getting them levelled up high and then just sneak a mon in for least work possible they are motivated to do the work for their own benefit too im not advocating sniping but an open spot is there ill take it a lot of times these gyms close to the next level are former level gyms that got attacked that you level back up in that case it helps the other players in the gym that you came by sorry if thats a bit harsh but your post comes over as pretty selfish and derogatory towards those that want to work as a community strangers are just people you havent met yet working as a community is great and part of the recommendations i had but not required its just harder to coordinate and not always viable if your goal is gyms held per day id recommend heavily a gym day where you have a group go out and stock gyms together
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly this its far more painful than it needs to be
TheSilphRoad,removed,found myself a nice cp rattata last night so i checked the iv and it was so i evolved it into a raticate this thing is quite the contender lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,you tend to thing niantic would be a little more sympathetic if its a protected area i wonder their reasoning for going ahead and putting another there unless its based on the data usage there meriting another stop and they just arent paying attention
TheSilphRoad,removed,fastmaps we have fast maps just like we had poke advisorpg nexus then they added the appraisal system if niantic wants us to stop using party sites theyll fix the tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,scanners driving pgo is almost over
TheSilphRoad,removed,first time in history niantic did something that was more proactive than the community wanted
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe niantic just does care and this is their way to give the town the bird so to speak
TheSilphRoad,removed,waitso youre telling me that niantic is adding pokestops to spite a people following lawsuits against them but wont accept requests or add pokestops to areas that would actually benefit from this
TheSilphRoad,removed,need the update already i bored af
TheSilphRoad,removed,its almost like that was the update item
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh boy im getting gloves and socks such exciting update
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you didnt have a contract and all numbers were off a handshake i dont see how your obligated to foot the bill based off of nothing considering they dont even honor your discussed amounts time for some better business bureau and some publicity
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol spoofers
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know who else to blame niantic for not embracing the foss community and allow legit api for trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,good to know the scanning bots are getting such good exercise
TheSilphRoad,removed,take out cars and spoofs and bots crawling around while we sleep and the number actually walked is or less is my guess the game really is pokemon go drive nearby tracker promotes this in suburbs and rural
TheSilphRoad,removed,and just think all my walking has been done while in my car
TheSilphRoad,removed,they say walking i say driving around town really slow to hatch eggs just saying
TheSilphRoad,removed,get a new updated phone scrub
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks like this is our christmas event
TheSilphRoad,removed,unlike pokemongo and niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,my friend got one from weedle apparently i wasnt there though he wouldnt lie but i have no proof so
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont need to prove a negative
TheSilphRoad,removed,well theyre letting you post saying things you remember with certainty that you can not prove in any way
TheSilphRoad,removed,i kind of agree with you but they included a tracker in the game why why did they do that if they didnt want us to know what was around and explore blindly the pokestop tracker can be really awesome but its actually more like the cheat websites than it is like the original tracker which is just weird it all boils down to people behaving unreasonably recklessly when tracking using the original system and the dangers of that the media hype around the game at launch and all the negative stories of people trespassing made them change it im sure of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i found a lapras by running into it due to nearby pokestops it didnt appear on nearby and if i had turned a different direction i wouldnt have found it the new tracker is absolute garbage with fancy graphics and animations to make it seem legit
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,you should have gotten the local tracker first its easier and faster since you only have limited time
TheSilphRoad,removed,short answer they dont catch spoofers
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemonspoofing
TheSilphRoad,removed,poorly
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should have called the last days of it pokemon escaping event a shameless way to get you to buy more pokeballs which i didand they still ran
TheSilphRoad,removed,tt save balls i have still about same amount of balls i started with despite having made around candy for starterpokemons i guess i m lucky living near a spawn of around pokestops
TheSilphRoad,removed,is the event over i want to know when the event will begin halloween was an event i was able to find the event pokémon everywhere it was great this felt like how the game should be i found the tier event pokémon here and there i saw charmeleon show up a few times after that i only saw ivysaur venusaurs wartortle blastoise and charizards i am sure if the event were to be extended i would have ran into a charizard eventually but that is how the game should be these popular pokémon should not be sooo rare that you never find them and if this was an actual event they should have been even easier to find bad show niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,who knows who cares this is totally speculative and in my opinion pointless to discuss
TheSilphRoad,removed,the letdown for me was only seeing one charizard the entire event after raspberry and great throw ultra ball single throw it runs away no second chance nothing which is why playing in a rural area sucks if they did not have sightings working to see where charmanders were at pokestops i would never have gotten enough candy to evolve up a charmeleon with sucky ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,by tormenting regular players with temporary bans and errors apparently
TheSilphRoad,removed,i spent pretty much the entire event staying with my family in the country so i was only able to hatch about eggs and caught very few starters the starter event finished right after i got home and i only hatched one cleffa from my event eggs pretty disappointed
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic says north america region what they mean usa
TheSilphRoad,removed,its shocking how many countries with pokemon go out have no access to any of the regionals
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive also caught tauros in edmonton alberta its not just southern canada
TheSilphRoad,removed,is there any logical reason for drawing the line cutting off parts of florida and texas is there some scientific gps based reason they couldnt hug the borders of the united states to actually include all off the united states please someone give me a reason other than this is a company run by idiots
TheSilphRoad,removed,so you can get tauros in parts of mexico but not in miami how does that make any sense it also seems really unfair that so many places have no regional mons why is asia limited to so few countries why are entire continents left out are there plans to add other regional mon in gen also stupid question from someone who didnt grow up on pokemon are the regionals we currently have existing mons from earlier versions of the game or were they created for pogo
TheSilphRoad,removed,why did niantic block out half of florida florida is still in the us and a lot of people go to visit the parks i bet someone has visited florida on a trip and was sad to not find a tauros also makes me sad since i havent traveled anywhere else exepct to new york once years ago but trading might help me get one
TheSilphRoad,removed,so what the shit is so special about the factory batteries
TheSilphRoad,removed,its starting to get ridiculous
TheSilphRoad,removed,still no tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,like every other terrible decision thats been made since release
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep its really boring now just beat their pidgey and put in urs gg niantic at least revert the prestige gained for training to no one prestiges now
TheSilphRoad,removed,a city with an area of and a population of half a million the gyms in the city centre and in areas with large apartment blocks are heavily contested with pokemon ranging from to then there are more remote gyms around the city with often poor signal reception reachable usually only by footbicycle these hold a lot longer in extreme cases even months
TheSilphRoad,removed,its working like crap for me i think this is it i quit its the only game that has worse performance after every update
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is what niantic has forced us to do instead of rooting for your own team i now root for other teams to have gyms around me so when its an hour close to collecting coins i can easily put my pokemons in so much for encouraging team work and all that youve really f cked up your own game niantic even casuals who used to complain about gym stagnation have finally been able to engage in gym battles and grow themselves only to realise how pointless it is to power up mons and collect good defenders since any snorlax you get now will last only seconds longer than a ratatta funny thing is whenever i check on this subreddit and the other one i see more people complaining about this gym update in one update niantic managed to invalidate everyones hard work including the casuals very sad really
TheSilphRoad,removed,its snowing here right now if i saw a gym worth leveling up ie i would walk to it over snow and spend min in freezing weather leveling it up given all gyms are level now there is absolutely no reason for me to even bother checking now all gyms are being fought for by gps spoofers exclusively since weather isnt a factor for them thanks niantic for driving away all the casual and hardcore players and making it easy for cheaters to take over
TheSilphRoad,removed,same niantic killed my motivation to complete my pokedex when they killed their own tracker and party trackers i still want to do it but its so difficult now that i care far far less they killed my motivation to keep gyms with this update for the same reasons you outlined i passed up taking back one of my normal gyms earlier today that ive kept an eye on since july because its just not worth the effort they killed my motivation to get pokémon with the best movesets because im basically always low on pokeballs suburban player with few stops and relied partially on getting stops when riding with my wife in her car or her getting stops for me while i was driving currently my motivation is to hatch eggs and get buddy candy literally just trying to fill the activity rings on my apple watch i dont know what else to play for especially in the cold when my phone buzzes in my pocket while out waking i have to consider if its worth it to remove my warm hands from my coat pocket to check and see if its just another ratata spawn appearing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i used to happily do both place pokemon in many gyms and always try to prestige the gym before leaving so the next person wouldnt even have to now i just hate my own team i wont prestige out of spite and when i see a gym at its basically dead to me—im not going to do four battles at least just so some other asshat from my team can snipe the spot before i get in it might as well be a level gym from another team filled with snorlax
TheSilphRoad,removed,now watch as all the lowlife lawbreakers in this thread desperately lie and try to pretend they arent butthurt that they cant play while driving anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,level and extremely bored here
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously lol does not matter though unless you want to be stuck at a pokestop for a half hour catching rattatas
TheSilphRoad,removed,wtf they buffed the already op pokemon like dragonite vaporeon gyarados and snorlax and they nerfed pokemon with already low max cp like the starters at least venusaur and blastoise vileplume exeggcutor the only one that makes sense poliwrath
TheSilphRoad,removed,sick mine went from cp to cp
TheSilphRoad,removed,from what ive read so far it looks like the cp changes correlate with the pokes that had a big difference between their standard and special stats in the main games which were averaged together to create the pkgo stats this is why pokes like gengar and alakazam had mediocre stats despite being powerhouses in the main games they had great spec attackdefense but shit regular attackdefense stats i would tend to assume that if the cp changes correlate to this then the underlying stats used to calculate the cp under a new formula also changed meaning that special stats would now be in effect this is obviously merely a theory at this point and testing is required in order to confirm or deny this
TheSilphRoad,removed,does it not mean that we essentially wasted stardust on some of our pokemon then my best pokemon were arcanine and i used a lot of stardust to get them to the topnow they are not at the top of my list kinda seems lame to me its nice they balanced everything better but give us some of the stardust back then
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe not everyone is on a laptop and it takes longer to find these things on the app
TheSilphRoad,removed,all my mons are trashed now
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think its being fixed pokeassistant works for lapras for the new values but not dragonite
TheSilphRoad,removed,my lapras were buffed and nerfed simultaneously
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean if i can see them that often then they should too takes seconds to delete a post just lazy ass moderators
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah yeah yeah we know and we know your pokémon are healed hallelujah
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic should provide amnesty and unban to those participating to the event using flygps due to public safety reasons
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i dont understand a few things like raichu has literally not changed at all still trash while jolteon skyrocketed even magneton is miles better than raichu now wigglituff got nerfed hard too capped one at and now hes like upper at best
TheSilphRoad,removed,then no you had one chance where they picked like people and those were high level ingress players just explain that shes not paying for your phone and women should be making sandwiches not trying to have opinions
TheSilphRoad,removed,currently unique species have been sighted via tsr pokedex
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is stupid they should just add it later as an option even if its not planned for
TheSilphRoad,removed,cmon niantic give something forbthe rest of the world
TheSilphRoad,removed,and all of this gym nonsense who cares i want to battle other trainers my friends people i know people i dont buy would like to meetnot some bot with random ascii character sequence for a username phone vibrates youve locked eyes with a trainer hey you i see you playing pogo hits button i challenge you to a battle you cant turn away win enough battles with a type battle a gym get your badge win actual loot what in the world is this hyper convoluted gibberish theyve delivered instead why are rival teams holding down points is this some kind of capture the flag or is it more leftover source code from ingress either way its totally laziness they had the entire recipe for success handed to them all they had to do was add an ar component they didnt even need a plot every story would be unique aside from only being able to choose from two basic avatars all they had to do was stick to the formula but instead they made ingress with pets then turned that into a biweekly cash grab its a joke you cant do anything at all with the pokemon you catch cant level them really cant breed cant alter moves cant obtain or use tmhms you cant even properly evaluate them you cant interact beyond pressing a button to hear its bit crushed call oh wait you can battle bots at a gym theyre not so much gyms as they are remnants from ingress but so what when you battle you arent interacting with players in any capacity you arent actually engaging anything you might as well be sucking your thumb actually your should just be able to drop revives and max potions at the foot of the gym and get pokecoins back automatically while someone else sneaks on under you skip the illusion that theres anything more happening there and by the way i havent button mashed to win a game since tekken was in arcades because gamendeaign has evolved past the need for it as a method of battling heres how deep the mechanics are you can a attack or wait for it b you can dodge i think they made a movie about the latter if i wanted to play ingress i would have but i dont i liked it better when it was called geocaching niantic needs to stop trying to rebrand ingress as a pokemon game get over it get creative and do some actual game design
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a disgrace lets milk the rural players some more i consider quitting as i cant get enough balls to catchem all without petrol be honest and confirm this is a city only game
TheSilphRoad,removed,here we used to have snorlax quite commonly here in tenerife but that stopped and its now infested with omanyte sandshrew kabuto psyduck magikarp and slowpoke but we get quite some lapras now more commonly than before id say i also got very lucky i have hatched snorlax also we currently have a lot of dratini in one on our cities i already have another dratini to eventually evolve im almost level
TheSilphRoad,removed,is this what they mean by end game further updates include loyalty rewards programs at participating outlets
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is still relevant
TheSilphRoad,removed,vaporeon arcanine rhydon vaporeon rhydon flareon arcanine flareon golem arcanine jolteon as you probably can tell i live in a town full of eevee growlithe rhyhorn
TheSilphRoad,removed,last monday just before i hit level i got my first dragonite after hatching the dratini from a egg i caught more and one low cp dragonair i evolved him to dragonair and then i hauled his heavy ass for two hundred sixty five damn kilometers and plopped him on the finish line with cp steel wing and hyper beam and two candies to spare and i have still never seen a dragonite in the wild not even on the tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,if its just reddit so everyone can be as mean as they want then i can be as mean to you as id like no one owes you respect if you wont give it to others especially when you are a literal retard lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah well but the discussion is not against tos if niantic feels its worth to screen op for that its niantics thing not ours to worry about
TheSilphRoad,removed,i made a post here with the info i got
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,time affects the pokémon spawning on the nest a good example is kabuto every time i scan his nest there are a good amount during the night but once i star scanning during the morning the nest is full with a uncommon mix of pokémon and not a single kabuto spawn this confused me like hell during summer this also happens with omanine but i havent seeing this behavior with other pokémon yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey niantic hey hehey niantic fix ur game
TheSilphRoad,removed,the worst text is going to a valor gymred on light grey cant see shit unless your brightness is maxed out
TheSilphRoad,removed,where are these scanner bars im thirsty
TheSilphRoad,removed,can someone link me the patch notes this update seems kinda serious
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know that feel bro almost too
TheSilphRoad,removed,feel exactly the same and im level
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed im close to and in a similar head space grinding for potions to take gyms everyday is getting old speed cap killed me i buy coins anyway so its really pretty pointless i will be quitting soon if things dont improve
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is why players dropped by about or something crazy pogo is a great of a game but it doesnt end and theres no point after the initial few weeks i went hard in the first few weeks when it was released and quickly became like youonly lvl mind you but just quit there are far better ways to spend your time but stay subbed like me and youll know if there are any major updates or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,not quite at your level but i feel the same fatiguethe gyms are pointless to even try in my area because spoofers have them lockednot sure about you guys but i have a job so exploring isnt always an easy taskthey definitely need more content other than packing in more pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,literally getting burnt over here in australia
TheSilphRoad,removed,what slowed me down was realizing that everything i was doing manually hunting catching finding simple joy in perfectiv finds etc was being done already with little effort by spoofers botters and folks using trackers i started feeling kinda silly doing all that walking
TheSilphRoad,removed,im getting burnt out as well so recently i started going to all my local parks and using osmtracker to map them out since hardly any of my local parks are mapped out properly in openstreetmap i wanted to help contribute to making the map data more accurate and in doing so perhaps making pokemon go more fun and enjoyable for all doing this renewed my interest in playing pokemon go again but now trainertips nick comes out with a video saying it appears niantic doesnt use openstreetmap data which makes me not even want to continue making openstreetmap more accurate and i feel that all the work i already put into the map data is in vain im grasping at straws to enjoy pokemon go here
TheSilphRoad,removed,am i the only feeling like this not even a little bit im sort of waiting to see what they do with their next real updatealthough they should have fixed a couple of issues last weekand go from there
TheSilphRoad,removed,funny you are making this post midjanuary this is how most people felt like months ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,we need a different meta game to play i stopped a few months back at i have thousands of candies because i got tired of lucky egging gyming is boring and most often a waste of time because of the time dump vs benefits i felt like a literal catch bot
TheSilphRoad,removed,i stopped after i rooted my phone to install a custom rom back in novdec only to find out niantic hates rooted phones for no reason stopped playing on that alone and havent missed it because the game just seems like grinding for no reason walking to hatch eggs i couldve completed the dex but then they add in more pokemon to keep the grind going and i was only really interested in gen now there are pokemon i dont care about and it makes it harder to grind out the amount for gen it was just going to be walking to hatch eggs and get candyfor what
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon that arent on the tracker or near any pokestops are still popping up for me as i am walking around even when i didnt have a pokestop near me
TheSilphRoad,removed,serious complaint not a question removing sightings was a bad move and i fail to see the logic behind it niantic is again doing a poor job of understanding their user base
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know we want to positive but heres the last couple of months or so from niantic the game is about getting out and exploring so were shutting down all trackers the game is about getting out and walking and exploring youre going to fast im a passenger hey whered everything go on nearby i cant spin pokestops dont play while driving its not safe get out and walk new tracker is testing and coming soon implements a tracking system that helps you find nothing in your general ie walking area but you can sure sit in your car and see lapras at south dale church thats miles away better hurry kills innocent people in fiery car crash
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am in dallas my nearest pokestop is about a mile away i have nothing on my sightings anymore i know there is a ponyta right next door to me but it does not show up on my sightings dfferent accts with different ipall show nothing i know there are pokemon close nothing shows
TheSilphRoad,removed,other pokemon are still in the wild but if you are within a few miles of a pokestop they wont show up its completely broken
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive had it for a month or so in a suburban environment and its terrible it informs you about distant things while remaining silent about those in your immediate vicinty all depending your proximity to pokestops there is no more tracking or hunting there are now only ways to find them go where they tell you or stumble blindly
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes be glad it is useless as far as i can see and i cant see what is actually nearby any more ive been out messing with it for the last min sigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,be glad you dont have it it blows
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not a tracker anymore its like shooting animals in a zoo if you liked the challenge of finding something you only knew was near then this tracker is not for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,darn im so bummed out i hope they get overwhelmingly negative feedback and cancel rolling it out to my area changed or otherwise but i have a feeling that their egos and the sunk cost fallacy wont allow for that
TheSilphRoad,removed,what the heck seeing it in action now and now that i have a tracker this is the first time ive been tempted to use a party tracker i dont care about the spearow mi away i want to know if anything awesome is at the rare spawn across the street
TheSilphRoad,removed,it sucks from my place now i see a bunch of parass near a pokestop that is too far away nothing from the spawn points near me why do they hate us
TheSilphRoad,removed,its horrible what idiot thought this was a good idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh no fag
TheSilphRoad,removed,no i think its more that niantic are really combatting party trackers by eliminating the sightings data a party tracker would have to have a bot dedicated for you do something like scans over a minimum period of three minutes just to give you the pokemon within a radius of your location so in a way what theyre doing should help reduce the effect of bots somewhat although i wouldnt be surprised if some enterprising soul comes up with a hive of bots that actually use the nearby data to notify users of when decent pokemon spawn and which pokestop theyre nearby it just seems to be a constant arms race
TheSilphRoad,removed,it was never useful even if you had stops nearby it does not favor rare pokemons most of the time you will see pidgeysrattatasspearowsekans or whatever ultra commons are in your area they might as well just have deleted it altogether
TheSilphRoad,removed,ew
TheSilphRoad,removed,ratta whatever the name is i mean got about now i use a nonenglish client so i dont know the english names p
TheSilphRoad,removed,i once saw a pikachu barebacking a charizard
TheSilphRoad,removed,best regards from easy to do quiz
TheSilphRoad,removed,you call changing few formulas and numbers hard work i luld
TheSilphRoad,removed,best regards for quiz
TheSilphRoad,removed,its easy karma every single subreddit ive ever seen has posts like this its more copypasta than the navy seal guy
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we take a moment no
TheSilphRoad,removed,this needs to be the top comment
TheSilphRoad,removed,you mean by removing completely then giving us a worthless new tracker or by breaking the audio
TheSilphRoad,removed,they probably should only push so filter would be server side the more they send the easier it is for trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,they have mishandled just about every aspect of this game from day the only thing even keeping this going is the fact its linked to pokemon no question the overight complete overhaul of stat changesstill not sure how i feel about the fact they are completely able to rearrange a core aspect of the game with no warning and screw alot of people over in the process who knows what theyll decide to change tomorrow how can you truly invest in a game when the rules can change overnighthe again if this wasnt pokemon none of us would be here playing and that is what is saving them
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah the sub exists because people thought it was an easter egg or possible to hunt down but it wasnt now its just a normal catch among others
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe of they werent rolling out a tracker that would disable half the playerbase from playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,why should a useless criticism get downvoted and a useless praise get upvoted cmon
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant praise niantic the nearest gym is vacant and has been for hours it used to turn over constantly before the changes the closest pokémon showing in nearby are too far away to walk they are just pidgeys and paras something available in any parking lot i can raise my pokedex from to with a fairly common ditto thats not exactly earth shattering double xp is nice for the few days we have it but it really doesnt affect the gameplay much when your level is in the
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry you will never get this they have been doing these games for years now they dont see any reason to start now
TheSilphRoad,removed,are they still welcoming feedback because i just got the new tracker and its exactly as bad as i imagined i spend of my time with pokestops nearby meaning not actually within reach so the tracker is basically useless now its completely replaced the sightings which were at least passably useable also even if im surrounded by pokestops i would much rather hunt down a pokemon than be spoon fed its exact location with this pokéstop bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,revenue is more important to them than praises ps screw niantics for speed bumping everything
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for taking the tracking system away completely niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just dont understand why people are still playing this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,doesnt take a lot of basically give everyone ditto for thanksgiving hoping trading pvp battling and the new tracker arrives before ny
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is a sub dedicated to just about everything
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant thank them they rolled out the game killing tracker right before thanksgiving weekend so they have all these events and my tracker screen is completely empty because i live too far away from a pokestop even though there are pokemon all over the neighborhood when i am somewhere close to a pokestop all i see is an entire tracker page full of multiple rats and pidgeys they just ruined the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,people have been giving them feedback for a long time on how awful this tracker is all during testing they dont care
TheSilphRoad,removed,assholes complained about it hence the forced change i was also forced to change my username a month ago cause it was insulting to some had the word fukc in it asshole that reported it
TheSilphRoad,removed,hard work lmao those buttlickers
TheSilphRoad,removed,appreciate what these moves for money
TheSilphRoad,removed,for all the money they have made i expect more to be honest i cannot believe they still have not implemented any end game and killed what little end game there was
TheSilphRoad,removed,i for one am about ready to quit this game and play pokemon sun full time
TheSilphRoad,removed,id appreciate it more if they didnt shadow nerf the radius on then nonstopbased sightings
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow you must be one special snowflake
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah that tracker they put in game to replace the one they had a launch is great now i cant even see what is in my neighborhood but i know that there is a pidgey and bellsprout at a pokestop a mile away and is unreachable by any means other than a car great work niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,with everything fleeing after a berry great ball curved great throw it really doesnt matter what you do
TheSilphRoad,removed,audio is still broken on ios game is still buggy as hell it starts to not register any inputs several times a day right now i had to forcequit it two times before pokestops and arenas appeared
TheSilphRoad,removed,please upvote this so they realize it if they havent yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,this happens sometimes just transfer the changed pokemon they wont work in gyms anymore i had to transfer a vaporeon because of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah niantic keep rewarding crybabies you cant beat a gym cry a bit and they make it easier you cant use ya weak pokemon against pokemon that people have spent dust on training up cry a bit a they make yours stronger and theirs weaker
TheSilphRoad,removed,my first partner was a snorlax so i would be happy as a pig in shot to get more of them
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know what i think i did hatch one i have only one starred tauros with really strong stats and i hatched it on august it is cp with stardust requirement but then i remember i powered up a tauros when i was in europe to put it in gyms i bet it was this one so it could have been lvl originally so this might be my one and only hatched tauros
TheSilphRoad,removed,lucky eggs are useless
TheSilphRoad,removed,have people on this sub stopped believing in coincidence i see posts all the time about how there are more starter nests than before etc its a research sub not a n of one make sweeping connections sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont have words i have to create more accounts now to downvote this as gas as possible before the virus of ignorance contaminates everything
TheSilphRoad,removed,they did that so you accidentally choose blue one and spend more money
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres an idea maybe niantic can get their heads out of their you know what and release a hot fix like any other company would have done by now
TheSilphRoad,removed,phew that lack of regional hatches definitely sucks but also confirms my experiences to date good to know that ive got basically no reason to buy incubators anymore when travelling i guess
TheSilphRoad,removed,the one im afraid
TheSilphRoad,removed,web tool posted on tsr yesterday should help i love this helps you find stable out of the way gyms to join too httpsgymhuntrcom globally atm mystic controls gyms valor instinct and emptyin transition
TheSilphRoad,removed,baby announcement dont forget to drink your ovaltine haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,hyped no just three more dex fillers possibly even not that
TheSilphRoad,removed,kinda stopped caring when it happens may care but i dont expect to niantic to implement it in a good way especially if they try to be too fair
TheSilphRoad,removed,absolutely zero hype on my end i think putting out pokemon before legendaries completely burnt up any hype we all had this roadmap in our heads that was something like regular pokemon first then our legendaries then the next generation with gen already being introduced i believe they simply dont have a mechanic that works for distributing them in a way theyd like to it feels like gen is underway and legends are on the back burner and it could stay that way for a while
TheSilphRoad,removed,just do it no one cares you having a friend in australia is just as unfair as someone being able to afford a trip to australia
TheSilphRoad,removed,how what works fairness i didnt know there was a detailed manual on the inner workings of what is fair
TheSilphRoad,removed,telling someone we dont care about this kind of cheating isnt promoting it we arent telling him how to cheat or if they will get caught we are saying no one cares except you for some reason
TheSilphRoad,removed,quality
TheSilphRoad,removed,lets be honest even if nobody was on holiday they still wouldnt fix it
TheSilphRoad,removed,urgh i thought people would stoo asking thus auestion last week it is the same answer as with previous boxes yes
TheSilphRoad,removed,re
TheSilphRoad,removed,no they can only use master ballss
TheSilphRoad,removed,post it on reddit fml
TheSilphRoad,removed,posting for the sake of posting as i like hearing the sound of my own voicebut the op knows full well koffing has never been a starter
TheSilphRoad,removed,weeks ago fair chance you will never find it and bit late to be asking but thats me
TheSilphRoad,removed,when i discover things in game that i never seen before i just accept them jump on reddit and search and people have reported a change like this one months ago but i dont create a new thread about it on the off chance i look like a noob moronlike you just did
TheSilphRoad,removed,first thing id do is not post on reddit and send niantic an email as they took your money did you need me to help you breathe and go to the toilet as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic support good service pick one
TheSilphRoad,removed,minutes before this thread its getting worse on tsr
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a terrible idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,terrible idea like how does it even make sense are people posting ideas just for the sake of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,the same goes over yonder at rpokemongo recycling of the same old whining and complaining
TheSilphRoad,removed,something that actually reads the game data i guess other methods only estimate the iv and can be inaccurate
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wonder how long they can keep this up if its going to be forever then that sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,you might as well start spoofing now bc niantic has yet to ban a single spoofer in my area honestly doing something as extreme as taking down a whole citys gyms might get their attention
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think their strategy to ease load on their servers is just to hold out on releasing any new features until nobody wants to play any more
TheSilphRoad,removed,i almost missed it as i avoid discussions im addicted to trolling this is totally a psa but yes thanks for the reminder omg
TheSilphRoad,removed,as we have less and less to discuss these threads come earlier and earlier each fortnight soon enough just a heads up everyone the next migration is right now so you only have days to the next migration
TheSilphRoad,removed,the irony is rich
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont see why it would matter honestly i dont see the difference in stale gen pokemon on top of fresh gen pokemon i doubt niantic will put much thought into nest migrations when planning gen drop date
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a pretty great succint article that sums up the average players thoughts imo its fun for a while but then its just not theres been no significant change in the game since day outside of events and even then the actual gameplay is not evolving merely somemultipliers and rng odds
TheSilphRoad,removed,it isnt pissing and moaning considering niantic has referenced both rthesilphroad and rpokemongo previously i think its in everyones best interest to acknowledge that ticking sound in the game before the player base goes boom brainstorming and offering suggestions or even analysis of player involvement in beforeafter new features were released could make the game much better after all if no new gameplay is added tsr will be a relic by and nobody wants that
TheSilphRoad,removed,probably stop posting dumb things to tsr
TheSilphRoad,removed,its sad really still clinging to the last threads of hope though
TheSilphRoad,removed,what should i do choose a more meaningful subject
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol pmsl
TheSilphRoad,removed,in florida so weather isnt the issue gym and lure activity has significantly dwindled over the past couple months people are losing interest fast thats kind of expected with boring gym battling mechanics catch and repeat and lack of substantial updates
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy shit im at this is freaky
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have dragon and karps days ago i encountered dragontype but the lil fucker ran from me
TheSilphRoad,removed,im on gyarados and i have for the badge so im theory i should get gyarados for the badge
TheSilphRoad,removed,no problem friend thats why were here cuz niantic wont tell us sht ahem go check out your badges and look at the one that looks like an egg the breeder badge click on it and youll have your answer
TheSilphRoad,removed,brb changing my apartment building and office to university of phoenix satellite campuses
TheSilphRoad,removed,cue the depressed trombone sound of wonnnnh woonnnnh wooaaaaannnn
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe fix the sound no maybe fix the tracker no maybe fix the white screen on startup no
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you honey dicking me
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not convinced niantic is capable of that if they cant flush out the twicereported lone spoofer in my city of i doubt theyre capable of a largescale plan like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,what do you think im with you crazy
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,is it only gen pokemon thats super disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use httpswwwpgnexusggpokedex you can drill down on each pokemon and see all their moveset combinations with dps listed for attacking vs defending
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok and
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill add a few other passages from that same book maybe not the best source for ethics or lifetips deuteronomy esv no one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the lord deuteronomy nasb if two men a man and his countryman are struggling together and the wife of one comes near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who is striking him and puts out her hand and seizes his genitals then you shall cut off her hand you shall not show pity anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the lord your god must be put to death such evil must be purged from israel deuteronomy nlt as you approach a town to attack it first offer its people terms for peace if they accept your terms and open the gates to you then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor but if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight you must attack the town when the lord your god hands it over to you kill every man in the town but you may keep for yourselves all the women children livestock and other plunder you may enjoy the spoils of your enemies that the lord your god has given you deuteronomy nlt if a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father then he must marry the young woman because he violated her and he will never be allowed to divorce her the ark of god was placed on a new cart and taken away from the house of abinadab on the hill uzzah and ahio sons of abinadab guided the cart with ahio walking before it while david and all the israelites made merry before the lord with all their strength with singing and with citharas harps tambourines sistrums and cymbals when they came to the threshing floor of nodan uzzah reached out his hand to the ark of god to steady it for the oxen were making it tip but the lord was angry with uzzah god struck him on that spot and he died there before god samuel nab make ready to slaughter his sons for the guilt of their fathers lest they rise and posses the earth and fill the breadth of the world with tyrants isaiah nab anyone who is captured will be run through with a sword their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes for i will stir up the medes against babylon and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off the attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows they will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for the children isaiah nlt however you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you you may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners including those who have been born in your land you may treat them as your property passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance you may treat your slaves like this but the people of israel your relatives must never be treated this way leviticus nlt when a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod so hard that the slave dies under his hand he shall be punished if however the slave survives for a day or two he is not to be punished since the slave is his own property exodus nab slaves obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear serve them sincerely as you would serve christ ephesians nlt christians who are slaves should give their masters full respect so that the name of god and his teaching will not be shamed if your master is a christian that is no excuse for being disrespectful you should work all the harder because you are helping another believer by your efforts teach these truths timothy and encourage everyone to obey them timothy nlt
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh its useless
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh its bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,idiot
TheSilphRoad,removed,how about saying it rather than referring to cryptic stone age texts
TheSilphRoad,removed,ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,kind of just sounds like your friends quit so you followed as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,this would be stupid as hell i hate you nerds that think you should be able to easily get the best moves and also train ivs stop being such a fricken baby that wants everything handed to you
TheSilphRoad,removed,luckily you are not invited
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we all just admit like every single other company niantic needs to give us a road map this constant guessing is pretty annoying
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre saying that not every pokemon you own has a perfect moveset wow you poor thing so oppressed
TheSilphRoad,removed,query has got to be the gayest word in the english language it sounds like a word you should say in a nasally unattractive voice while shoving a pencil into your butt and readjusting your taped thickrimmed glasses
TheSilphRoad,removed,bye felicia
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmfao because a cell phone game is the same thing as a classical instrument or a sport
TheSilphRoad,removed,they all have female characters ingame but theyre all actually just male neckbeards that jack off to chinkanese cartoons having a female character in a game is the closest they can get to real female companionship
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was at the age when i only paid attention to by the time came out i was more interested in porn
TheSilphRoad,removed,a we need legendaries first b if they release it in the spring there is a chance i could get friends back on board with this game if they release it in middecember ill ask them if they want to go to local park xyz and theyll say fuck no
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been having this issue for a month on an iphone start pogo no pokemon on nearby and no pokestops restart pogo pokemon on nearby but no buddy and no spawns restart pogo no buddy no nearby restart pogo normal maybe
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have one perfect guy a nidoqueen with bite and earthquake shes and was my highest for a while but since the update not anymore not even close and im sad the update was well needed so im over it but i dont use her as much anymore i also just found a cyther which i love cos hes super rare here i throw him on top of gyms just to look like and be a bad ass i also love my jolteon army but right now i guess so does everyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,i despise how we can never get a straight answer about this because every time a thread has been started all of the cliche redditfags come flocking hurr durr ive never seen one ever hurr durr isnt my selfdeprecating humor so witty so obnoxious and annoying
TheSilphRoad,removed,caught my pikachu today some of the other may have been hatches rare as rocking horse teeth round here
TheSilphRoad,removed,mad
TheSilphRoad,removed,i find it hilariously ironic that players in sf are the ones who now have to check their privilege lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,cos then every one would have fucking million star dust x
TheSilphRoad,removed,scrub along the timeline in a song and it goes to normal
TheSilphRoad,removed,meh it was ok but not as good as the past events they really should have brought out legendaries
TheSilphRoad,removed,just another incident of niantic treating its customers like scum not good enough
TheSilphRoad,removed,to make me feel a little bit better i usually start to think like this bulbasaur took balls charmander ok so i actually wasted balls on each which isnt super bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyre not that rare im level and ive seen about eventhough i live in a small town back when i was using a tracker theyre spawning quite often youre just never there when they do
TheSilphRoad,removed,man i cant belive this game its crazy to think than you bust your ass to walk n get these eggs cracked and you get nothing out of it in my case i got super lucky and hatched one of every mon and pichu and two togepi
TheSilphRoad,removed,well thought out post stars
TheSilphRoad,removed,increased
TheSilphRoad,removed,a little offtopic but is there a decent webside atm to check all my pokemons ivs at once like pogobag or other sides did before dont want to enter every value each time for every mon
TheSilphRoad,removed,well yeah they are rare im just saying its not like they never spawn in your area they probably do you just cant find them
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you want to cheat go for it i dont i play legit cheaters dont bother me much so what a few gyms loaded with good pokemon there are plenty of legit players loading good pokemon in gyms its no different no reason to make me stop playing every single game there is cheaters
TheSilphRoad,removed,but cheating is waaaay too pointless
TheSilphRoad,removed,people on this sub are just getting dumb
TheSilphRoad,removed,sometimes i wish i knew how to spoof
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah so what stop whining then
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use tracking apps to cover pokémon near me that the ingame tracker doesnt show anymore i cant camp there all day and the old tracker told me about those spawns now its only rattata and pidgey and no i dont have a massive collection of rares dragonite evolved lapras hatched no snorlax am i cheating for bringing back a feature that niantic removed if so i dont mind
TheSilphRoad,removed,this very much this niantic can kill some of the third party trackers just by giving people a working tracker and no whats in game atm is not functional and just a joke really sadly city wide scanners like i heard some people setting up will probably remain
TheSilphRoad,removed,what would the name of this app be
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip
TheSilphRoad,removed,id be game but i live across the atlantic c i hope the road pulls through for you try asking the africa subreddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,hotfox theres an inappropriate joke about vulpix and ninetails here but i just cant get it tt
TheSilphRoad,removed,while i live in an urban area i still rely on my bus commute to gather items especially as we head into the rainy season this bums me out completely theres simply no point in opening my game while commuting honestly it was the only way i was stocking up maybe their pokeballs werent selling enough sigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,here on silphroad we look for positivity where there is none
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is pretty upsetting to me i dont have pokestops near my home or work on the weekends as a passenger in the car id get the vast majority of my pokeball stock so i can catch stuff at home and on work breaks not sure what im going to do now
TheSilphRoad,removed,legally the warning is all it takes so as for another reason have you considered good intentions it may be hard to imagine while your teenage brain is on a hate rampage but if you have several millions of players that may be put in danger while tending to their phones above certain speed it somewhat becomes your moral obligation to prevent that at least you a large degree of control over how your game is played and you can work from there but niantic are just a bunch of money devouring whores that dont understand elementary maths let alone game design they dont care about nothing with their black hearts just to make the game as boring and literally unplayable as possible sure that sounds more realistic
TheSilphRoad,removed,now you can spend all your pokécoins on balls go ahead and pick up lures as well its quite obvious they want you to just sit and one spot and play paying for all resources and keeping ourselves out of dangerous areas or driving while playing i mean cough cough as a passenger
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip pokestops while using the plus and driving speedban secretly implemented
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is such a disappointing change especially since if you arent on the dominant team in an area you need to have a constant replenishment of supplies in order to compete at all so now if you dont live or work in a place where you can keep replenishing you basically have to spend an absurd amount of time to do so
TheSilphRoad,removed,congratulations for living in a region where pokestops are abundant andor cars or public transportation arent necessary for travel
TheSilphRoad,removed,another really bad change and we have the new tracking system that most people agree is pretty meh that hasnt been changed since niantic started testing it beginning to roll out to more areas but then on the positive side we have colored eggs now sometimes i really have to wonder why people are so upset
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive level this does it for me i cannot take another week of them making this game unenjoyable done
TheSilphRoad,removed,its hard to be optimistic about a group of developers who are doing their absolute best to kill their own game
TheSilphRoad,removed,im done with this endless waiting while these people take over my gyms in town already downloaded the app needed to spoof if anyone else needs it just pm me no need for root or anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,let me know if you need the app needed to spoof all you have to do is download this chinese version of it no root needed pm me
TheSilphRoad,removed,come back and comment after you try to spin a stop from your car
TheSilphRoad,removed,it seems every couple of days they do something to kill it yet here everyone is
TheSilphRoad,removed,fun while it lasted guess ill go to the app store and get my refunds now
TheSilphRoad,removed,transform my shitty twister to hydro pump niantic pls
TheSilphRoad,removed,gonna be optimistic here i bet ill be able to get a couple of days maybe a week of game play in before i realize this game is now unplayable anywhere but a large city with a dozen pokestops within a minute walk
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is really going to love that i wonder how they will prevent it
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is exactly the reason why they changed this you came away with hundreds of poke balls as you cruised around there aint no mo cruisin to be had get to walkin or uninstallin
TheSilphRoad,removed,you just challenged them to do worse
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this just ruined my hour cars rides with my dad down to the shore next summer
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont but i can see them in my pokedex from them being in gyms it did not look like them
TheSilphRoad,removed,this isnt ok honestly i think i cant play this game anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant find any optimism this time sorry final straw ive been a huge apologist but this destroyed the game when i cant get items on the daily bus ride to and from work free time is limited
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is just wiggity wiggity wack
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank you for speaking the truth but this country has given up on personal responsibility bunch of money hungry ambulance chasing lawyers and people looking for a payday so they dont have to work anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah my girlfriend and i both uninstalled im done trying to play a game that actively attempts to screw me out of enjoying it
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip pogo honestly it is getting insane niantic does not announce these things at all i get most of my items via public transportation so no more pokeballs for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,on the other side as a solo player in a grouping town i wont be able to solo any more gyms goodbye rural folks
TheSilphRoad,removed,i see the no fun allowed pokemon go policy is becoming less of a joke and more of a reality
TheSilphRoad,removed,yawn saw this coming i am totally predicting a tresspassing lockout next the game is going to see how far off the road you go and then filter out all pokemon if you venture too far into private property lol whatever so now we drive what gets me is that they are literalyl making the game more dangerous by forcing certain behavior i use pogo while driving and now i will just be break checking more often people are not going to stop playing in cars while there is a one button solution to fumbling with the phone take away that one button solution and you will still probably see people in cars lets think of it this way niantic is designing an altered reality game they have to deal with reality in how they alter it their focus is on lockouts delivered through certain functions of reality that they dont want to be a part of their version of altered reality no matter how much they alter it they are never going to completely change reality and the reality of it is that you are less likely to get robbed mugged or assaulted while in a car you have air conditioning in the summer and heat in the winter you have a radio and you have to drive to places to play the game in the first place i am not walking miles just to get to my pokestop route so keep battle human behavior and keep seeing human behavior adapt to the limitations that you inflict upon it it is a pointless struggle a location based game that is set in reality is going to involve strategies for changing locations in the real world that includes bikes skateboards golf carts go carts scooters wheelers and cars
TheSilphRoad,removed,yet another change that simply targets players ability to enjoy the game meanwhile the game crashes more than ever and they just keep adding more of these things that are likely background processes responsible for overloading the ram in the first place memory leaks all day but its important to get this pokestop nerf rolled out people are just hitting too many stops
TheSilphRoad,removed,for me i have been struggling to keep it up as the game crashes more than ever the most recent patches added multiple memory leaks that make pogo even crash after a minute or two of use now its even harder to play meanwhile it still crashes just as much every patch just makes the game cost more resources simply to make it impossible to play under more and more conditions still love the game but the more and more unplayable it becomes the less and less i can play literally i just cant play at some poine people like myself are going to stop struggling to enjoy this game it is quite a struggle right now the halloween event was great but the game was already crashing on a per minute basis this change just reduces conditions that the game works fine and still doesnt address the many memory leaks that make the game unplayable in normal conditions
TheSilphRoad,removed,see this is where things get weird and youre going to want to fight me on this but the world existed before the matrix came out they were sued a few times some were successful and rightly so theres some information for ya no prob tldr first round of lawsuits defeated with money round settled out of court round successful because leaked documents showed they had been lying since before the first lawsuit
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow what a notwasteofmoney the go was
TheSilphRoad,removed,its just i dont what to say niantic think theyre covering their asses legally by making all these changes but all theyre doing is making the game worse for the vast majority of players who arent actually doing anything wrong i mean if youre getting your phone out while operating a motor vehicle is niantic really accountable for your own shitty decisions the idiots getting into accidents are the same fuckwits who would text or check their facebook accounts while driving and theyd be doing that stuff long before this game even existed
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can also now stagger instances with a friend to double that number again since the gym doesnt actively update the roster the moment its cleared if another instance is running tested this with my friend earlier and we demolished a level gym in about minutes there is literally no point to this game anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres zero strategy to the game anymore you cant even defend the gym now if you tried attackers advantage was just quadrupled with this update and now the only viable way to boost a gym without spending hours on it is bubblestrat
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a horrible design decision for players who actually did gyms all day and defended their territory mathematically speaking it is impossible to defend a gym of any level or composition now without a defender to attacker ratio and the defenders all have to be getting max prestige with half cp trainers and maximum dodging skill the attacker just has to be level at least and mash the screen mindlessly to win that race this update has sucked the only competitive aspect of the game out there was already no point to levelling up your pokemon to be better defenders since anyone level could already take a gym down easily of any level the game is now reduced to people taking turns collecting their coins and never touching gyms again for the rest of the duration of their cooldowns some players will still just bum rush their ten gym rewards like they did the first month but gym participation is basically pointless now good job niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres almost no viability in prestiging without bubblestrat youre better off just going to your inventory and throwing out as many pots as you intended on blowing to boost the gym up just to have it destroyed in five minutes by any random level who pokes it lightly
TheSilphRoad,removed,what the fuck this ruins everything
TheSilphRoad,removed,simple answer yes elaborated answer niantic what the fk is wrong with you
TheSilphRoad,removed,welp im done with this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont drive but i take a bus and a train twice a day as well as cabs in between noticed the try again later message on the bus this morning and guessed it might be a new antidriver play measure the logic is breaking my brain a terrible driver could use any one of a plethora of excuses drunk changing the radio sending a text playing some other game yet niantic kneejerk because theyre mentioned there are other people on the bus who are not the driver who would like to play guys on the train
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool the gym stagnation babies finally got their bottle of them will still be too big of wimps to actually go knock down level gyms it will primarily be the same players knocking out enemy gyms but it got a lot easier
TheSilphRoad,removed,those on any transit system get the big screw you when hunting pokemon my cousinfriends and i will have one drive and the passengers monitor the sightings that is completely useless just in time for snow and subtemperatures
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe you shouldnt have had kids then lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,wheres the best place to contact them to complain if enough of their customer base complains maybe maybe they will change it back as many have said this is a final straw for rural players like me we would have to walk mile to my nearest pokestop with only two spawn points on the way being able to spin while a passenger is a huge part of the game and one of the main reasons im still playing when i heard had been confirmed i was actually thinking of buying coins for incense incubators and maybe a backpack upgrade if they dont upgrade it along with now if i cant spin on the go im probably quitting thats a big change and one i would think theyd like to be aware of rant
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i wouldnt have to cheat if they bothered to add pokestops to rural and suburb areas being on a bus in my town where i work is my only chance to refill my pokeballs normally i have to walka round to one pokestop and we all know that it doesnt drop a lot of resources i could hardly keep up the balls count even though i cdont catch many pokes where i live if i wont be able to spin stops in but its over for me or ill just start spoofing while in work to refill at this point im mad and i might do that
TheSilphRoad,removed,on work days i dont have an extra hour i guess this game just wont be able to fit into my life anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,even then i suppose your aware that the system you described actually ensures an equal distribution of coins amongts the whole community thats far preferable to what we had yesterday unless you were one of those few guys that were making without having had to do a gym for weeks
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic just stop playing already
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip
TheSilphRoad,removed,buff cheater players omg this suck
TheSilphRoad,removed,at best you can hope to waste the attackers time but hes going to win anyway this is what makes this update and the whole gym system so stupid theres literally no point to having strong pokemon anymore a standard cp vaporeon hyper potions is somehow now just as useful as a cp dragoniteand thats stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,its unfortunate that for every great descision they make there are four bafflingly atrocious ones
TheSilphRoad,removed,itt high level players whining that their gyms arent stagnant anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are not the center of the world
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyre basically flailing at this point theyre probably hemorrhaging daily users and instead of just fixing shit they are looking for any way to keep people interested until they can rush gen out
TheSilphRoad,removed,you just like to spew stupid shit on everything you post
TheSilphRoad,removed,good question only lord john hanke nows
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just tried out the changes for myself needed to boost up a friendly gym prestige selected my team of mons to beat snorlaxs gym error selected them again battle worked and didnt have to wait minutes to not get errord out woo ran out of time prestige said fuck it and selected a team of mons beat both snorlaxs received prestige gave up lol still these changes are better than having endless lv bot gyms you should be rewarded with stardust or something for prestigeing if theyre not going to turn up the prestige gain right now prestigeing is pointless
TheSilphRoad,removed,so instead of fixing issues theyre going to rush out gen in a pathetic attempt to keep people playing awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongospoofing
TheSilphRoad,removed,dagnabbit foiled again
TheSilphRoad,removed,low for you is high as shit for my area is seldom seen in casual areas
TheSilphRoad,removed,you will have to visit niantic hq and blow the ceo
TheSilphRoad,removed,not removing tracking got rid of all the spoofers and bots right thats what i was told would happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,that guy sounds like a dummy
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic really does not want you to stay in any gyms for more than an hour first they make it twice as harder to train a gym and twice as easier to take down a gym and now they make it so youll never run out of revives and potions when taking down gyms alright so now that weve established that niantic apparently wants you to use gyms as a quick checkin before the next team arrives within the hour what is left to do in this game trying to dominate gyms by constantly training them up was literally the only fun in the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,trumpish da fuck eanectodal personal evidence fact but hey keep hillaryin it up
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,i guess tomorrow or the next day niantic better hope its a good one otherwise a lot of fans will leave imo simply due to a long wait for nothing with no communication
TheSilphRoad,removed,prediction next apk is bug fixes or monor tweaks only content getting stretched out more if we see more gen pokemon this quickly might mean they have actual new features planned for down the road but if this is the moreorless complete game then expect them to drag out the release of new pokemon because pnce theyre all in what else will get players hyped
TheSilphRoad,removed,i always compare this game to pokemon shuffle which is completely unfair since pokemon go has more resources and money but basically pokemon shuffle manages to stay updates with new content even small content every tuesday since launch it feels fresh every week and i always have something to do in pokemon go its been a month since we had any update and the only thing thats going on in the game right now is the nest migration every once in a while but that alone is not exciting enough i can related to your feeling and today for the first time i thought about taking a break until theres something new in the game i believe niantic should learn from genius sonority and should update the game every week even with small changes small updates keep the flame up and make your game interesting to follow if you dont update your game in a month it feels like youve abandoned it and that is bad for a video game when theres so many other to play im level with a full nonregional dex and have constant control over gyms i have a great army of pokemon for any situation with great ivs and great move sets and basically ive invested so many hours into this game that i cant remember a moment that pokemon go wasnt on in the background of my phone during the last six months and i will delete this game completely without blinking about it if i had to choose between this and shuffle because shuffle updates and gives me the feeling that it wants me to play go give me the feeling that it wants me to farfetchd the hell away
TheSilphRoad,removed,your not alone op ive been feeling this way too even though i havent reached level quite yet xp away nor have i captured all na pokemon only lapras and chansey left i feel like im just playing to play i keep hoping that by playing ill be able to happen upon new context that doesnt exist im ready for more than just gen honestly but that would be a great start with the redundancy of pidgey and rattata at every step i take maybe hoothoot and sentret can be my new annoyance and then i can strive to walk with my only larvatar so i can evolve it into the beastly tyranitar had to do this with my only dratini outside of gen pvp would be great along with breeding or trading hopefully something new will be here soon but im not holding my breath
TheSilphRoad,removed,im only level and i feel the same way i used to catch every pokemon i saw and i found new species all the time and the game was a blast now i skip the vast majority of pokemon i see because they leveled up with me and are much harder to catch and my pokeball supplies cant keep up and because ive almost completed my pokedex so i dont need the candy either also gyms arent very fun because the combat mechanics are too simplistic and also because they are buggy as heck even if i did enjoy them all the gyms in my area are owned by my team and stagnant as heck i havent attacked a gym in five days and im still collecting coins every morning honestly i feel like im only logging in every day now to build up supplies for the next special event or for when they finally release gen
TheSilphRoad,removed,same boat i think powering up pokémon is only meaningful to pvp without pvp i dont have any motivation to continue the trainer adventure
TheSilphRoad,removed,unfortunately as it is
TheSilphRoad,removed,not an update but trending news here
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats what you get when said company releases a finished game
TheSilphRoad,removed,jeez get a life
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you honestly believe the latter come onyou cant be that innocent
TheSilphRoad,removed,wouldve been great if niantic devs understood what that meant as well not just bumping the version number to
TheSilphRoad,removed,no because i dont have autism
TheSilphRoad,removed,naw just max out your defenders and perhaps an elite strong attacker or two for taking down gyms fast wghp isnt a good defensive moveset and golducks max cp isnt high enough to compete with top gym spots vaporeon will be stronger than this guy with the higher cp hp even though his atkdef base stats are lower and eevee candy is more abundant so if youre going to max a wghp mon do it on a vape this looks like a great prestiger though and the cp is just right maybe a little high
TheSilphRoad,removed,wouldnt it be easier to have a friend use your account there
TheSilphRoad,removed,was just about to post this
TheSilphRoad,removed,why has no one commented yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,is that it egg nerf and apple watch seriously have they ever tried to prestige a gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,so bgger all basically
TheSilphRoad,removed,not the update ive been waiting weeks fori hope datamining reveals something special or i might have to take a hiatus from pogo
TheSilphRoad,removed,we waited for so long and thats it i really hope they at least fixed the bugs but forgot to mention it
TheSilphRoad,removed,so no fixes gym battling problems no new content unhelpful release notes why am i not surprised
TheSilphRoad,removed,gen confirmed hype train derails wildly
TheSilphRoad,removed,now this is an awesome update
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow is that all niantic after so long i really hope theres other things in data mining or else ill be mad
TheSilphRoad,removed,changed distance tracking to better account for gps drift thank you for making it even harder now to hatch eggs i can go on a walk and ill be lucky if i get registered at least when i was sitting down on with a cup of tea the gps drift made up for some of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,unless the datamine shows different its my time to pack up and take a break its been nice boys
TheSilphRoad,removed,how can a developer be this awful seriously
TheSilphRoad,removed,starting feb and lasting until feb you will only be able to catch the exact same pokemon in the exact same order every day no changes increased chances of seeing bill murray in the wild
TheSilphRoad,removed,month for this at least i hope they fixed the crash when the game start
TheSilphRoad,removed,changed distance tracking to better account for gps drift awesome s
TheSilphRoad,removed,every time i open the fridge httpsimgurcomgalleryigmyx
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow of all the problems with the game this is the one they try and tackle priorities
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsimgurcomgalleryigmyx
TheSilphRoad,removed,was hoping theyd fix the gym problems and the start up problem
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe it means that now gps drift is more likely to be counted maybe they improved egg tracking big hopes knowing niantic the answer is no
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol just lol waits a month looks at changelog cries
TheSilphRoad,removed,obviously please let me vent my frustration with them
TheSilphRoad,removed,l i t t e r a l l y n o t h i n g
TheSilphRoad,removed,something tells me gyms will remain broken
TheSilphRoad,removed,if the comments in this sub are this bad i could only imagine rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic never disappoint i was quite confident they will literally do nothing and they did month of working just curious why not major text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,more reasons to not play this game that i quit playing already
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol all they wanna do is nerf this game no fun i cant even hatch eggs while running stop making the game less fun add more things to do then did this stuff theyre just driving ppl away
TheSilphRoad,removed,arent we on january why are they making the aprils fool joke now ayy lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,so in summary nothing pretty disappointing even if its coming from niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry the game is buggy distance tracking is buggy the tracker ignores half of the pokémon around i dont think we deserve anything but this is a product and there still are paying costumers hoping for some bug fixes is not expecting too much
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats my only hope for this game right now haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,big if there
TheSilphRoad,removed,the login bug is big enough to warrant a rollback of whatever it is tied to nvese hiding charge attack text warnings is extremely easy to fix while working on a real fix disable that nvese text im sure people would rather not eat charge moves by surprise instead of not seeing nvese until they roll out the complete fix heres two examples of quick and easy bandaid solutions to improve user experience while working on the actual fixes but they chose to fix gps drift instead which a lot of people see as a small bonus to hatch egg hence understandable frustration rpokemongo is too critical of niantic most of the time but here people are way too quick to jump to their defense no matter what they do imo constructive criticism and expressing frustration in a reasonable manner is important
TheSilphRoad,removed,what about the fix for the crash on opening damn
TheSilphRoad,removed,weve been saying that for a while now i feel like laurence fishburne endlessly waiting for the one
TheSilphRoad,removed,most people are getting zero miles anyways because its impossible to login
TheSilphRoad,removed,can i drift with the app closed because right now i cant login
TheSilphRoad,removed,imagine a software company thats made billion hiring a bug team and a development teamdare to dream
TheSilphRoad,removed,performance issues not fixed unplayable gyms not fixed login works once every full moon not fixed new content hell no gps drift had to be fixed asap
TheSilphRoad,removed,yikes when did this comment thread delve into ceaseless arguments between those disappointed by the update and the cynical who never expect anything what a sad read
TheSilphRoad,removed,i call it a from all the distance they steal from crashing and not counting distance in the first place
TheSilphRoad,removed,heck of an update boys
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its not it doesnt fix gps drifting it just supposedly doesnt count the distance when youre drifting
TheSilphRoad,removed,expectations destroyed
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean i get gps drifting is technically cheating but the game doesnt accurately track distance in the first place shouldnt they fix that first the game is cheating against me but instead of fixing that they continue to cripple me getting every two hours from my desk at work is just as much bs as the fraction of the distance i get from actually moving not a good way to start l
TheSilphRoad,removed,im starting to believe that they actually now view the game as more or less complete feature wise can it be true in the beginning i read somewhere that they claimed that they only had implemented like of the planned features this statement has kept me playing and hoping but now i just dont know anymore probably focus on other hobbies instead which is not too bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,the shitstorm is strong in this one
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wish i could play this damn game but its been too slow on my phone for at least half a year
TheSilphRoad,removed,guess im done with this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,false hope
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only customers that matter are in america never mind its summer in the southern hemisphere australia im originally from america and it embarrasses me every time i see a comment like this they could do a generation release every months and the game would still be around for years assuming they also make new games in the next years
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is retarded app of with the revenue made app with the most downloads in and yet niantic hasnt changed at all since the launch or even ingress launch its not like they cant afford to hire more programmers theyre just unwilling to improve their standards the game is ridden with crashes memory leaks dodges are not registered properly in battles for months cheaters and spoofers play freely and what are the changes for new feature for apple watch which affects like of players maybe even less changed distance tracking a secondary issue if you consider some people cant launch the app and of course minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,i see they are addressing the real issues with the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am more concerned that it will negatively affect the already inhibited distance tracker it already does not accurately measure distance now we are supposed to trust that it will accurately differentiate between drift and real movement or what we dont move at all if we have a bad signal im actually pretty frustrated that they continue to fix bugs that work in our favor but dont acknowledge the ones that work against us
TheSilphRoad,removed,given that the last update is what broke the android login with the xmas event over there is no reason not to roll back whatever changes were made to at least make the game playable that should be far and away the priority
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can imagine how they are sitting in their office and laugh out loud at us i really hope this minor text fix will be good
TheSilphRoad,removed,so no crashing or restart the game times to actually play fix my friend is gonna be pissed
TheSilphRoad,removed,being able to open the game is a feature you should expect out of a game
TheSilphRoad,removed,all right its time for a break
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems like the speed limit is even lower than it was before now i was getting try again later at mph used to be mph a few times but also was able to flip a few at so as usual niantic is consistently inconsistent minor text fixes ftw lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe in hopes niantic notices
TheSilphRoad,removed,not gonna lie im slightly burnt out if the data mine doesnt show anything worth me sticking around for ill be taking my temporary leave
TheSilphRoad,removed,reading the whining in this thread i thought i was browsing rpokemongo but nope its the silph road actually
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic has already proven they care more about making their game the shining light for ethical gaming in the world so honestly them limiting their players in every aspect to achieve some sort of perfect game in their eyes does not surprise me theyve already done this with limiting passengers from seeing nearby pokemon and spinning pokestops and theyve also worked very hard to shut down just about every tracker niantic has a vision for how they want their game to be played and despite anything we do to get around that they always seem to keep limiting us further i just wish niantic would stop limiting our ability to play the game and would maybe offer new reasons to play instead of less because in reality in locking down on all forms of cheating per say they havent seemed to invest much energy into luring more players to their game and if they continue this trend honestly the future will not be bright
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe true but if its only a glorified distance tracker then theres really no reason to keep it around when there are passive trackers which allow me to read while walking
TheSilphRoad,removed,garbage also not an update
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the first version that i dont want to install asap
TheSilphRoad,removed,uhh okay i get a dragonite every hours next week ill have
TheSilphRoad,removed,did i somehow land in that others sub calm down guys
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats it
TheSilphRoad,removed,as usual sounds like they fixed a leaky dam by blowing up the dam
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have the same issue but if i minimise out of the game just before it loads and switch back then it works fine but niantic seriously needs to fix the real issues not this nonsense
TheSilphRoad,removed,good company not take a vacation good company have shifts so their developmentservice is not stopped at any given time anyway with niantic results on app development its safe to assume that whole team is on nonstop vacation from release from which they take breaks for couple days in a week to do some minor text fixes and go back to vacation for another week i might be a bit too salty on that but thats how it actually look by results of their work i think month is enough time for company to change to better or at least show some signs of improving for now its safe to assume that in niantic case not gonna happen dtrump
TheSilphRoad,removed,they need to release the babies or something else in to the wild tomake the game more fun people will only grind out high levels for so long
TheSilphRoad,removed,people need something to complain about for me the game is getting a little stale when theres no event happening but im not going to condemn niantic since ive gotten a ton of enjoyment out of this game for free
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope they change it to at least update more often still hate how turning a corner reduces walk distance
TheSilphRoad,removed,aw man
TheSilphRoad,removed,so theyre fixing problems that arent problems rather than providing us new content or fixing problems that are problems what a bunch of s
TheSilphRoad,removed,and how is that fair they cant accurately track distance as it is so they are going to track even less of it i have yet to be upset by an update but this is ridiculous everyone will be affected by this i get low accuracy in many areas that are nowhere near large buildings people living in rural areas can suffer the same they dont even acknowledge that we only get a fraction of the distance we actually travel but they are quick to try to cut out anything that works in our favor that plus many other bugs that impede gameplay like the multiple issues with gyms are the real issues and they should be focusing on problems that negatively affect gameplay not the minor issues that provide a small benefit that only a portion of the player base takes advantage of
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,so they worked for weeks on fixing a hole that gave some players a little distanceadvantage instead of fixing the gym bugs lets just hope they didnt kill the whole distance system by doing it
TheSilphRoad,removed,one does not simply expect features or content from niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,spoofers have perfect gps and drifting
TheSilphRoad,removed,they were aside from the increased starter spawns the events were pretty lame niantics own poll about the events on twitter shows that they were not very popular the first part of the xmas event was by far the least popular event yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,it doesnt seem like the update provides much incentive anyway
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic would do themselves a huge favor if they just code the game to pull gps location from google maps probably save themselves a ton of coding improve accuracy and in general annoy the players less plus they could stop messing with minor game functionality and concentrate on new content but at this point ive given up hope that niantic actually is competant at programming or business
TheSilphRoad,removed,this has to be a joke right right guys
TheSilphRoad,removed,well they havent bothered to acknowledge those bugs to begin with
TheSilphRoad,removed,one would think that in the last weeks they might have prioritised issues that were making the game almost unplayable
TheSilphRoad,removed,fixing the distance tracking first would have been a better move instead of nerfing the little amount we get from drifting
TheSilphRoad,removed,so glad it took them weeks to add no new features what so ever just fix a bug that helped players
TheSilphRoad,removed,no mention of fixing the awful gym battling glitches awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe they are actually joking and will post the real announcement later today or tomorrow
TheSilphRoad,removed,its so stupid that we waited weeks for this update such a lack of content not even new feature even if it would have been the smallest one i would have been happy but nahhhhh
TheSilphRoad,removed,just hit level this game feels more and more like a minimal fitness app with a pokemon skin dlc
TheSilphRoad,removed,abysmal what are their developers even doing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love that they release a fix for the apple watch to enable it to show eggs from pokestops yet nobody uses apple watch app to spin pokestops because the connection to the apple watch is so awful
TheSilphRoad,removed,trash update probably well get a even worst gps tracking gps drifting was actually giving a fair reasonable distance compensation for the broken gps tracking niantic got going on
TheSilphRoad,removed,he needs to let the users decide how to experience the game hes a control freak thats addressing nonexistent issues just because his vision and his ego need protected
TheSilphRoad,removed,no word on bug fixes for startup freezes or gym dodge bugs or gym memory leaks
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think the important question is should it have been fixed before fixing the gamewrecking bugs currently present or before adding new game content to keep players invested
TheSilphRoad,removed,but not fixing the bug where it wrongfully kos your pokémon after a dodge and then goes to time cause it repeatedly keeps dying
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,so the only reason i have pokemon go open mon to friday is to drift for eggs now i dont need to open it up until the next good update so they can add battery saving to the list
TheSilphRoad,removed,such baseless speculation
TheSilphRoad,removed,changed distance tracking so you mean they wont fix distance tracking to give us the correct distance we have walked but they focus on those who might be walking back and forth in a small area grreeaaat
TheSilphRoad,removed,professor willow has discovered that the dodging bug amuses him so were gonna ignore that one and maybe make it worse just for s and giggles
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow minor text fixes the best patch ever
TheSilphRoad,removed,are nazi mods deleting every comment that has even a hint of negativity on this subreddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor text fixesminor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,no they have those things banned because they dont want their we suppress our people and tell them who to vote for ideology to get countered
TheSilphRoad,removed,what happened to the message from the professor we were suppoed to get in the coming weeks those weeks have passed now
TheSilphRoad,removed,why do you delete critical comments none of them were rude free speech
TheSilphRoad,removed,everything is running away from me now not again
TheSilphRoad,removed,after one month without updates and communication if the datamine doesnt reveal stuff like new moves meaning gen ii is close this very disappointing patch notes can be considered the biggest eff you niantic ever given us
TheSilphRoad,removed,i want them to find all kinds of amazing things also a smaller part of me that wants to watch the world burn wants them to find nothing at all besides the drift nerf and watch support so i can sit by the flames and eat popcorn while i watch the show
TheSilphRoad,removed,i swear to god if i need to go another month with these loginbattle bugs i am going to scream
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool so i dont have to wait for the play store to stop hatching eggs from drift
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant even handle the lack of communication from this companyhow many of you have invested your money into this game in anticipation of being rewarded for it and your patience the game is fun and addictive but there is so much missing from the social media and communication aspect which is why we are all here frustrated i just want them to talk to their loyal users about what they are working on what to expect and ask for our feedback because damn if we dont have a ton of it is it really that hard to dedicate someone to do that
TheSilphRoad,removed,your timer idea and proximity are worthless against botters botters can bot multiple throwaway accounts overnight to a desired level for trading effortlessly then transfer fat dragonitesnorlaxlapras to each new account dont open them again again the mon is sold on ebay accounts are now aged so niantic cant prove the owner was not travelling to a new area during down time same as when legit players appear overseas and niantic assumes downtime was airplane travel send buyer login information buyer opens throwaway transfer account on friendfamily members phone and does trade with himself botter makes buyer gets mon trade account who cares one time use anyways simple timer and proximity worthless
TheSilphRoad,removed,indeed i think it took nearly two minutes here i remember that the first versions used to load in about seconds ah those were the days when it was still fun to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,as someone who doesnt have an apple watch this update is extremely disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh look they made the buttons bigger yay
TheSilphRoad,removed,i expect nothing and will still be disappointed
TheSilphRoad,removed,im done screw you niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,is the app running smooth as fuck now for anyone else here
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this is the patch whoopidy fricken doooooo its getting really hard to stay on niantics side when it comes to the development or more accurately the lack of development to this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wish i could still be surprised about this but im really not
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean no shit the update text never contains everything
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont worry if its one thing tsr does its pretending that theyre better than every other sub the elitism on this sub is astounding just look at your comment they downvoted it into oblivion because they cant stand the fact someone is calling them out on it they love their echo chamber on how the game is perfect
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow a whole they might go bankrupt
TheSilphRoad,removed,comments whining quitting or venting would be more appropriate for the general pokemon go discussion subreddit thats funny because theres a comment disparaging other communities that is still up in fact it looks like it was pinned and endorsed by the mods
TheSilphRoad,removed,nexus here more that minutes to log in this is a complete joke i agree that if you destroy the game for every player you also might hit some hackers but seriously find another way and i thought that they cant do worse than the last update
TheSilphRoad,removed,f u c k m y s t i c
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic seriously such a money grabbing company fix the actual game play instead of working on things for pogo and apple watch the gym game is broken and almost unplayable they need to get their priorities right id dare say they would lose more revenue from people quiting due to bugs than they would get from apple watch
TheSilphRoad,removed,what you are sitting in the car at walmart in the parking lot whilst your husband is inside for a good mins and a further more mins whilst you wait alone in your car in the parking lot id call the cops on you and treat the situation like you are a single adult male looking dodgy around parks whilst children play that is how i view you now form your story dont care for your semantics word soup trying to justify it either i find women are the worst for this behaviour that looks odd and their reasons to try and justify it disgusting
TheSilphRoad,removed,i do freeze on load up sometimes but by no means is this even close to bad user experience not compared to the step bug and even worse the phantom buzzer every seconds you buzz that was ridiculous and i still believe the game was at its peak fun with the original tracker the current tracker is still beyond flawed as i cant hunt mons in my neighborhood without it reverting to pokestops and clearing all the best nearby mons to alert me of the constant trashmons at the pokestop but ive gotten over it
TheSilphRoad,removed,things like this make me so glad i lost my hope for this game long ago i still want it to be a good game but at least now i dont care because i was disappointed so much it just wore me down i started on release day and gave up after the second time they nerfed egg hatching lowering speed to
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been winning all your gyms thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry for the rant but i just cant comprehend why this was forced on us because niantic always does that they are pretty resistant to bug reports it could also be that wales the only players that niantic really care about do not have these problems because they tend to use apple but i agree that the app is generally getting buggier with every release and that is really disappointing there are exceptions but they are rare and they only revert the most obvious bug introduced in the previous upgrade step forward back
TheSilphRoad,removed,i simply cant sign in since the last update tried everything to rectify just hoping the next update fixes it good job im not that bothered about the event
TheSilphRoad,removed,i question myself why am i still playing this game every time the freezing home screen shows up its beyond frustrating
TheSilphRoad,removed,id probably feel more for the devs if the latest update wasnt such a pile of wank
TheSilphRoad,removed,just wanted to real quick remind everyone that about months ago pokemon aggression got doubled it used to be that when a pokemon made an attack or move action as long as you threw the ball first it still would be hit by your attempt niantic said they would fix that but here we are in and its still the same they really get way too much credit around here
TheSilphRoad,removed,at least you can play i play in an iphone with ios and the app crashes on startup since the forced update so i have missed free incubators and im missing on the starters people have said that upgrading to ios fixes the issue but im not doing that because i hate it i dont have free space for the update and i would have to erase half my music if i wanted some users have said that upgrading didnt fix the issue i would kill myself if this happened to me the app lists ios or above in the compatibility section the reasons i hate niantic right now are the fact that they let slip a compatibility issue in the update the fact that they forced the update even when it was buggy the fact that they havent acknowledged the issue or said they are working on a fix or just say the game needs ios already so i have no choice but to move on the fact that ive lost free incubators and starters and they will most likely never refund me im about to explode of rage right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,havent bothered in gyms since launch really have they made early it feel any more turn based since or is it still screen smashing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont have the bug but i get the bug sometimes iphone users are on drugs
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly niantic is about the if coins were easy to get they do not get another new mercedes in the parking lot besides botters would rake in the coins their bots walk the cities all day and all night long and never get tired
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry most casuals quit by the end of summer now it is just hard cores and botters left
TheSilphRoad,removed,op could be a cop this weekend starbucks employee spat in cops drink and posted social media about it in missouri or someplace down there black lives matter org cheered the move cops are not welcome at starbucks especially not undercover pokemon playing cops your lure gets turned off and your drink well dont drink it just sayin
TheSilphRoad,removed,need more minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly once people quit they move on in life and do not come back no santachu minor text fix or starter mini explosion is bringing people back who quit from the new nearby tracker speed limits or continued botting very dedicated valor cheaters with dozens of top tier dragonites and snorlaxes each have virtually taken over all gyms in our town they left us blue and yellow guys gyms on the north edge of town fun not
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic has to use the mcrib method to keep this game afloat
TheSilphRoad,removed,no it doesnt hes only gonna make the api public to a handfull of people none of which are botters if it does get leaked it wont be his fault
TheSilphRoad,removed,its amazing how much money they are leaving on the table with their poor management decisions millions
TheSilphRoad,removed,the sightings list will be removed from the game as it causes too much stress on the servers the map will be completely removed from the game to prevent the return of scanners pokestops now require coins to spin
TheSilphRoad,removed,in such a short time pokémon go has spread like wildfire tackling the obesity epidemic that has plagued an entire generation i think it has the opposite effect here we often get fast food on pokemon outings however in addition to that it is also doing wonders for those with mental health issues yet it sure preys on people with ocd
TheSilphRoad,removed,if for nothing else niantic needs to fix this game and develop new content for the countless many who benefit mentally from this game niantic could be indirectly responsible for the pain and suffering of so many and i know it sounds ridiculous but its true
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate the idea of pogo earning niantic so much money i stopped playing months ago but the game was all kinds of broken niantic wasnt releasing anything or even communicating with their player base when they finally got around to release patches they removed what was broken instead of fixing it i dont know how its been lately but ive been hearing the same old disappointment towards the devs from friends and havent heard of anything new fun or exciting
TheSilphRoad,removed,why is anyone convinced theyll do anything for the first month or two that i played pogo they werent even communicating with the playerbase and didnt fix a thing other than text fixes how have they been doing recently i gave up on them a long time ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,they wont get a dime from me not until they fix the damn game i might just drop the game as i need root hope the money making stops soon so the have an incentive to fix the damn game
TheSilphRoad,removed,so youve ruined the game for yourself by becoming reliant on a third party website and are now mad is that what youre saying
TheSilphRoad,removed,its incredibly impressive for twelve guys to carve out five gyms when totally outnumbered and surrounded on every side all three teams use bubble strat not sure how that diminishes their accomplishment in any way
TheSilphRoad,removed,we just need more data got some pidgeottos and want to help between people we could hit pidgeottos which woukd be more significant for sure
TheSilphRoad,removed,far more safe and far more miserable
TheSilphRoad,removed,but hes not being toxic
TheSilphRoad,removed,no negativity on this subreddit pls but on a more serious note im almost in the same situation i would have hit level in weeks but since the speed limit was put in place the only playtime i get everyday is the walk to and from the train station every day its getting colder every week and its raining a lot the motivation to finish my goal is dropping fast because i feel im getting punished by niantic for trying to play the game the go i bought for € is also useless because of the speed limit if im already walking around i can just play the game they removed functionality after purchase which was a really dick move now im stuck with it because im past the day return window over the past few weeks i went from a really happy customer to feeling betrayed by niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,other than practice doing it all the time maybe dont use your thumb other fingers are more accurate but you look slightly dumb when doing it
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive missed a kingler a snorlax a nidoran an eevee and a tauros because of this never seems to happen on pidgey though ಠಠ
TheSilphRoad,removed,personally id just keep these guys and wait for the meta to catch up gym cps just get higher as the game goes on remember when we got cp pidgeots as gymtoppers now you have to be well over just to get in the door i think eventually gyms will just be floored by cp vaporeon and itll get worse from there so thats when the cp venusaurs come out
TheSilphRoad,removed,bag and pokemon storage cannot be understated helps a lot if youre going anytime without having a bunch of stops near you
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,downvoted for using the term noob
TheSilphRoad,removed,alt account to knock the bottom
TheSilphRoad,removed,russians they are hacking our gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,sure the diversity of spawns shown is nice but id call it a stretch to call any of them uncommon let alone so many uncommon
TheSilphRoad,removed,some of us would dispute what you are describing as uncommon i think theres only about mon on your screen that isnt locally common for me but i live the diversity
TheSilphRoad,removed,rhyhorn and ponyta seem to be the only uncommon and ryhorn is the only one that matters national parks are usually nests though and thats why you go to them
TheSilphRoad,removed,bragging none of them are even good lol guessing you get tons of eevees instead i wish i got those instead of the ones in the picture ive only seen eevees
TheSilphRoad,removed,give me coordinates of your location and ill destroy all their gyms im instinct so i can attack both spoofer here would be fun lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,uncommons lmao that´s just a water biome in a desert biome nothing uncommon about it except maybe the magnemite
TheSilphRoad,removed,and yet the tracker shows a poliwag and magikarp when all that other stuff is obviously much closer
TheSilphRoad,removed,much autism in this thread
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game interface likes to waste your time
TheSilphRoad,removed,all thesebabies are worthless to keep it real
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,isnt voltorb steel type too though theres actually no way i see to look at your pokemons types when youre in pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,tbh if i get banned for that it will be the last i play its such a reasonable thing to want to know
TheSilphRoad,removed,i quit strictly because the update sucked
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a noob root an android phone and use an xposed module to see iv stats as your pokemons name why do the math
TheSilphRoad,removed,one could argue they cant make mobile apps very well either but i digress
TheSilphRoad,removed,you must live under a stone
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh my god you can pinch to zoom in and out i never tried that
TheSilphRoad,removed,this has already made a huge difference in my town my level gym that i spent an hour training has been standing for days now no spoofers sitting on their couch to come and take it anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,meh imho pokemon go is more fun when you cheat ive been cheating for well over a month and yet i still cant hold on to a gym for hours wonder why its because the game discourages people playing who are short on time im short on time i dont bother with the slow grind if you spoof smartly like never leave your neighborhood you wont get caught i think the app in general is actually a fun time waster at work thats pokemon go for me i dont have time for iv calculations to me i want everything to be available on my phone i pull up a nest map on my browser and a gps joystick to move around its actually a lot of fun im also going through crystal right now on a gbc emulator its a lot of fun so stop being a prude im just enjoying the game and will most likely never reach your lvl gym anyway if i didnt cheat i would be catching zubats all day at work thats no fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,its okay to swear on the internet
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is up with so many posts just reposting things that have already been said
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is clearly niantic who is the bad guy in this story they are a multi million dollar company and fail to do the most basic stuff associated with a tech company there have been several cases of criminals in history who worked for the guys they wronged by improving security if we want to play the blame game we might as well do it right niantic pulled the kill switch and left all the security holes open back in my days a true gamer would try to find any way to get ahead
TheSilphRoad,removed,we get it your life sucks stop trying to garner sympathy
TheSilphRoad,removed,you seem quite retarded is pogo your first time experiencing the world outside your grandmothers basement
TheSilphRoad,removed,spent money on pokeballs lmao dipshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only here is not being spent on pokeballs fuckface
TheSilphRoad,removed,omg no way
TheSilphRoad,removed,not sure why my comment was deleted its a valid point why would be want to split our sightings into different places
TheSilphRoad,removed,put this in your mouth for awhile d
TheSilphRoad,removed,imagine if the games wasnt an exercise in frustration
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been out months longer rightwho cares
TheSilphRoad,removed,funny i thought the opposite and dropped off after a few lines information too diluited for a forum post
TheSilphRoad,removed,and its only going to keep falling down niantic had the goose that laid the golden eggs and they killed it by not giving a damn about it and doing everything the laziest way possible
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree and i dont know why this was downvoted pokemongo isnt pay to win but it is perilously close to live in urban areas to win
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh no rpokemongodev are cheaters oh no reverse engineering hurts servers oh yes new data yaaay i dont get how people may be complaining in posts around about developers developing not for cheating but still be happy about what was madefound out and script kiddies will find out other ways to mess with game always
TheSilphRoad,removed,too little too late
TheSilphRoad,removed,imagine if they waited a month before releasing the game theyd have all the bugs ironed out and servers they didnt pull out of a dumpster i bet that top app streak would still be going strong
TheSilphRoad,removed,problem with the long haul is that the longer the game goes on the less appealing it will be for new players i started a few weeks late and only got into the mid teens because there are three spawns i can get from bed and a stop at work i have four gyms within two blocks and all the mons are from level trainers i still have a week or two before i can even begin approaching them as time goes on this will only get worse as those players reach level and beyond if you cant participate in the ostensible point of the game after weeks the charm is gone this is different in less dense areas im sure but that has its own stagnation problems unless more interesting content is added for midlevel players future updates will roll out to a rapidly dwindling playerbase
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think it was more to make emulating the pogo harder i dont think the percentage of rooted users was that high and i think it was childish of niantic to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,good theyre not getting another dime from me personally until they fix gym battling and make it a worth it and b not unbelievably frustrating theres no point in catching a million pokemon if i cant do anything with them
TheSilphRoad,removed,the problem is you lack reading comprehension it says dps rankings hence only cares about straight up dps the list is useful for those who just want to take out gyms quickly and dont care about items used dodging
TheSilphRoad,removed,all thanks to the rootjailbreak blocking update
TheSilphRoad,removed,too bad there isnt a next time or else id say next time dont remove the one feature that made your game worth playing consistently tracking go will never reclaim a top spot without either meaningful worthwhile tracking or these other cookie cutter apps just failing over time too many people i know who are hardcore gamers pokemon fans have given up on go because of tracking so i can only imagine how many casual players have left the game behind all because hanke is too selfabsorbed to just give us a simple damn direction distance radar
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been out of the game for like a month now i like grinding too but there has to be a goal ive caught all i can in the area i beat gyms on the way to class but what else is there the only reason i still follow this sub reddit is in the hopes that an update will come out that gives me something else to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they had only refined the game more when they released it they could have rolled out features when the hype was alive and sustain a lot of the people that dropped it once the nostalgia and mystery of the base game wore off so did the hype surrounding it and many people havent picked it up in multiple patches including myself
TheSilphRoad,removed,just feels like tracking was big problem and its going to keep bleeding out players because of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they bring tracking back theyll have their spot back
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup level here pokedex has been full for levels barely log in anymore why because theres no point in catching every pokemon if you cant do anything with said pokemon sorry i had to make that bold but seriously gym battling is absolutely unequivocally a frustrating and horrible process i am so sick of getting sniped and wasting hours upon hours of my time that i swore off gym battling completely once i swore off gym battling i had literally nothing to do with all these mons
TheSilphRoad,removed,there may better be a whole other battling mode released where again more levels would help or nobody is going to keep playing ftfy
TheSilphRoad,removed,is it just me or has anyone else noticed a dramatic increase in the rate of those sort of posts since the latest full moon
TheSilphRoad,removed,i disagree if the snorlax is less than i can pick from a range of lowercp pokémon that get the job done snorlaxs power comes from its high cp at cp parity its not that tough vaporeon works nicely if it has zen headbutt hypno or exeggutor work if it has lickhonestly its just not that strong as a defender then and your options expand a lot just dodge hyper beam and youre set
TheSilphRoad,removed,have you signed up to join the moderation team
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not surprised everyone has reasons bans or clash royale updates i think it just has to do with pogo nothing substantial added to the game since launch and most players having some kind of game experience issue stale gyms lack of mon variety lack of pokestops full dex and nothing left to do the lack of new content is whats going to be a problem here most games keep their player base engaged with new content ingress gets away with it because of the inherent back and forth team competition which pogo doesnt have even when they have released new features they have been fairly small additions readding a tracker and now the buddy system most notably and quite frankly the buddy system is a very minor addition helpful but minor they need community wide events they need something that keeps players coming back until there are more mons to catch and quite frankly gym team conflict is just not nearly engaging enough to sustain
TheSilphRoad,removed,no dumbass just no how is a difference of a few km walked quite hard you idiot
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey guys apparently pogo has brought up a zapdos shadow on my sightings tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,just caught a pidgey at a nest migration confirmed
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe just maybe we can all surrender ourselves to rngesus and just stop posting this hypotheses altogether i dont care if you think weedles catch rate has gone down whether it is backed by data or not its an irrelevant piece of info just like every other recently ive noticed post on this sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not for censorship but lets suppress all unpopular beliefs the reddit way
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wish i could upvote this more than once
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree with your main concern but disagree with your solutions what if instead of making unsubstantiated claims we put out calls for help researching them maybe you feel like weedles fleerate has changed but you need data this will do nothing to stop the spam and all it would do is take away timeenergy from the researchers of this community edit even a tag would alleviate some misinformation burden same thing doesnt alleviate the spam a lot of the theories here are frivolous and dumb if someone really has a theory they should provide their own data and post it before requesting help of others to look into it
TheSilphRoad,removed,instead of psa people should put uni for unsubstantiated nonsense incoming
TheSilphRoad,removed,those posts should get a or tag so we can filter them out
TheSilphRoad,removed,what you havent noticed the rare spawn increases that have happened every day since launch
TheSilphRoad,removed,how cool would it be if this game had any depth whatsoever
TheSilphRoad,removed,why so much complaining about a bug niantic knows about it and will resolve it when they can arguing bug prioritization with anyone but niantic is pointless
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know most people believe in zhbs but with this data i would much rather have zhhb just off the possibility that they get smacked with hb which results in a straight loss
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill ask the server admin if hes fine with the ip being posted here ill get back to you
TheSilphRoad,removed,personally i dont think its a bug because its been known about for months but hasnt been fixed or even acknowledged by niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,my last account was banned for telling them to shut up
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love this post ive grown fed up reading absolute nonsense posts here lately this sub was supposed to be factual based information with significant data gathered to be presented for peer review not omg i saw snorlax today they definitely increased rare spawns lolz thats completely irrelevant information and without any real base other than sheer luck people making those posts should go back to rpokemongo or a troll sub if there is one those low quality posts dont belong here
TheSilphRoad,removed,so high iv pidgey and rattata is your down vote answer good endgame i said endgame is nice to hunt the perfect evolved starters you want them from nests would take me hours to catch and travel to get all starters x about in london my end game over need it explained easier perhaps it is a bug perhaps it was easier coding this way to keep the most wanted starters who wants perfect pidgey in got there useless not cool looking id be proud to have a perfect char blast ect in gyms instead my usual common snorshstz
TheSilphRoad,removed,that requires coordination from both developers and community managers are there community managers at niantic that would be a major update by itself
TheSilphRoad,removed,now some faqqot is gonna make the same cookiecutter joke as whenever someone uses this word hurr durr hes not in the game yet jk jk jk s xd xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh boy new update maybe this week will get something interesnevermind
TheSilphRoad,removed,why cant they just revert the prestige changes it cant be that difficult
TheSilphRoad,removed,man so much whining in here we just got through a pretty solid week period for the game with the halloween event and extra spawns event and all i see is people being snotty brats because this update is minor
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive beaten the crap out of one he was a multi account person who would come in and swipe all the gyms with his accounts at around every day i tagged along and watched him and then confronted him about it because he was multi account cheating with malicious intent told him to stop it because its cheating told me to piss off so then i told him he if took one more gym i will beat him up i followed him and he did it and then i jumped in and punched him till he was on the ground crying and bleeding i dont care he was i am
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are why i beat up idiots who think they can do what they want trust me if you were multi account cheating in my face preventing anyone else from playing the game properly and if i told you to stop and you laugh in my face you best make it a good laugh because it will be something you wont be able to do for a while hate cheaters wouldnt care if you brought a knifeit wont be going in me if you pull it out so you better stab truly
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly i live in a rural area and the closest pokestop is about miles away and my tracker has been completely blank for the past hour or so rip trying to play at home
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a positive change for me as long as you get near the pokestop before the pokémon despawns its guaranteed to appear for you to capture sightings have always been iffy you are basically flying blind and hoping you guess which way to go correctly ill gladly lose sightings in favor of more nearbys
TheSilphRoad,removed,you will only see the pidgey
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is retarded not near any pokestops it was a fun time playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,this update sucks and everyone giving an excuse for it after the fact when they should have had a thread about there not being a good update this week if they had all this info on store freeze or whatever people are talking about
TheSilphRoad,removed,im done with this game if thats the case says im from toronto but actually gta so wont be playable
TheSilphRoad,removed,now this is game breaking
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn they really want to punish anybody thats not an urban player
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah i dont want either i want a tracker that actually works
TheSilphRoad,removed,i turned off auto updates i wonder how long i can play the game without updating wont help the server no longer sends sightings if there are pokestops nearby see what users without the update are experiencing
TheSilphRoad,removed,mind boggling if this is actually true the app gets deleted using sightings to triangulate and figure out the spawn position was the only thing in this game that required an ounce of brain i know im whining and that its just a game but bloody hell its hard to watch something with so much potential end up in the gutter its like they were handed a picasso and went to work on it with a blowtorch
TheSilphRoad,removed,there has to be sightings still not every pokemon is near a pokestop
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed and i must say that the fact that this is just a game makes me happier for each update
TheSilphRoad,removed,could this be a move to get all the half serious gamers to stop playing pokemon go and move over to sun and moon maybe niantic and nintendo have an agreement pogo gets all the super casuals who want everything to be dead easy and sunmoon gets the people who likes to use their brains and to be challenged
TheSilphRoad,removed,and fans are consistently saying this as well very few people actually like this new tracker system but niantic seems determined to push it anyway the only thing i can think of is theyre trying to push traffic to pokestops presumedly for some sort of backend sponsorship either way its just going to make every noncity player drop the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,as someone with the new tracker system this totally blows i have a spawn point i can only access from my yard with the changes in the timers etc i dont know when it is up now before if i saw a good mon in my sightings i could go see if it was in that spot now i would just have to randomly guess and go out there and look i could have a snorlax out there and never know it so dumb
TheSilphRoad,removed,stay the hell on topic this isnt a teenage chatroom
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks like the doubled down on the bad ideas and ignored the good ones
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think thats a terrible idea they got rid of step tracking to just add it back in a useless way imo worst tracker decision yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres no pros at all to remaining teamless unless you count unsuccessfully trying to brag on pokemon go subreddits about how cool you are for not picking a team
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have one stop near me in like a radius are all pokemon within half a km going to be near that one pokestop uhhh this is pretty stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,why do you allow posts that demonize lower level players for crying because they wanted to be able to fight gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor text fix finally lives up to its name
TheSilphRoad,removed,you should be fine man catch away
TheSilphRoad,removed,this seems horrible i definitely dont want this version of the tracking system nest aside nearly all of the cool pokemon i catch come from the handful of big cluster spawn areas in my town none of which are at pokestops and the single spawn point areas that my sightings list picks up from my house also not pokestop spawns i love being able to sit at home with my game open and take a run around the block when something rare pops up sounds like with this tracker im going to now miss all of the rare spawns that happen around my house because ill be seeing the venonat eevee paras and pidgey spawning at the pokestop church up the street instead thats terrible
TheSilphRoad,removed,no ban you can log into any account youd like on any device youd like to
TheSilphRoad,removed,for lebanon at least its much better than other neighbouring countries sure theres still some misogyny ingrained in the culture but it is that way in most developed countries to a certain extent but otherwise things are pretty good for women
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is cheating and i hope you get banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,just goes to show they do care about the game and are adding stuff its just you people are impatient the thing is no one here would knowbe able to do what they have done yet complain like they can so thanks niantic ive believed in yall since day
TheSilphRoad,removed,go ahead just remember not to log in for a while beforeafterwards an hour or so should be enough
TheSilphRoad,removed,be careful to not look like a spoofer so dont go online from europe on the same day that your gf logs into your account from the us users who teleport between long distances in an impossibly short time would be very easy to detect and ban
TheSilphRoad,removed,from that same article saudi driving ban saudi arabia is currently the only muslim country that bans women from driving as per a fatwa religious ruling
TheSilphRoad,removed,one day ditto is just gonna be in the game nothing special no insane cool reason someone will just come across him freak out and itll be one of the most upvoted posts until people realize hes just there now just like all the other pokemon they just forgot to add him
TheSilphRoad,removed,why are you being downvoted
TheSilphRoad,removed,please scrap this stupid pokestop idea many of my parks dont have many its totally useless
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks niantic i thought i just had to click the sightings image and theyll appear in my box
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been months people go pick up a main series pokemon game
TheSilphRoad,removed,so months ago when someone asked how to find ditto niantic lied and said he was in game
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip rural players
TheSilphRoad,removed,silphroad has no problem data mining and hacking but somehow feel the need to look down on people who use trackers lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can barely contain my excitement
TheSilphRoad,removed,not just the usa cough
TheSilphRoad,removed,another terrible decision imo
TheSilphRoad,removed,great update
TheSilphRoad,removed,awesome now i get to see venonat at the closest pokestops instead of seeing things that are actually around my neighborhood crappy update
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow how are they so consistent with this
TheSilphRoad,removed,guess they want to get rid of rural and suburban players yep quitting this game if they go through with this worldwide
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah they really showed their elitism there huh grow up and get over yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats terrible i really hope they change it soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is no minor text fix this is huge it must of taken quite a bit of work
TheSilphRoad,removed,but aborting eggs would make the pro lifers upset
TheSilphRoad,removed,the fix we were all waiting for thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here on htc one fix one thing break another
TheSilphRoad,removed,lucky i spoof so im always safe in our dungeon playing this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is just a reminder to those going in bad neighborhoods or weird places at night or break real life laws just to get to a gym i know this guy did nothing wrong but to many people are doing straight up dumb stuff to get a gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,just like him pokemon go is dead
TheSilphRoad,removed,sandshrew is pronounced middle eastern wife
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope but i believe did figure it out originally it was slated not to but im guess the update released with it changed that as i didnt update for several days after getting my plus and the update happened with the release that morning my only speculation is that because i did not update right away it upheld the original programming and could not catch them this is a theory of course but based on factual evidence that no you werent supposed to be able too and that it literately prevented me from catching both a rhydon and a victrebell the day of release with the device but no problems what so ever other wise but hey there are plenty of articles that back up my theory so just do a bit of digging guys and youll find that if there is one certain factor here the pokemon go plus was not supposed to be able to catch new pokemon originally nor track distance heres just the first two articles i found right at the top of my search to get you started out but there are plenty on google that support this theory
TheSilphRoad,removed,im touching myself tonight
TheSilphRoad,removed,whenever i run into players out and about and they brag about some really cool pokemon they have like a dnite or a perfect lapras or a regional from a different region i always ask if i can see it the very first thing i do is check to see what city it was caught it in half the time the next thing i do is laugh at how the pokemon was caught in a city they cant even pronounce
TheSilphRoad,removed,fuck them japan got lapras apparently if you want nice things you need to get some nice sponsors
TheSilphRoad,removed,im judging you based on what youve put out there to be judged
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank god you posted this easter egg never would have seen this great job op
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah you too buddy
TheSilphRoad,removed,would love if they just told us all the things in the updates that were relevent instead of sliding in lots of stuff dont really see the point people work it out or decode it straight awayanyway lapras is a pain i have had incubators running almost all the time from the first week and i was level when i got my first lapras but was still able to get almost evee the third most common pokemon in my area from eggs in that time
TheSilphRoad,removed,were not doing funny screenshots here
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol op is instantly downvoting anybody who criticises the post hilarious stuff fire away man
TheSilphRoad,removed,you cant stop the hype train were getting more pokestops in specific locations near where pokestops already are this is exciting news in the poke go community s
TheSilphRoad,removed,the hell all this has to do with pogo or tsr i mean really i get the hype but almost the whole new queue consists of literally pictures of a frap
TheSilphRoad,removed,wonder how many new gyms will pop up and how many will immediately be claimed by spoofers
TheSilphRoad,removed,us because starbucks isnt a world wide brand now
TheSilphRoad,removed,itsooooz its o owell of americazoizozooo its oof of faz c fc the c x and 👏🏾 aums p
TheSilphRoad,removed,this just further pisses off ruralnon us players
TheSilphRoad,removed,and of course these are the ones near my house rural players screwed again
TheSilphRoad,removed,punch first questions later
TheSilphRoad,removed,yawn
TheSilphRoad,removed,you actually believed this
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop playing you might do something you could have got more stuff for only play in events but wait there could be a better event with even more stuff best to wait for the best possible event this logic is why i never upgrade my phone laptop or model t ford
TheSilphRoad,removed,new tracker is gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,this one better fix the audio
TheSilphRoad,removed,op specifically said she opened the app after driving
TheSilphRoad,removed,so exciting crashes every half an hour if you are interacting with gyms a lot false vibrations if you have vibrations enabled and loading pokemon models every time you start the app extra data usage awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,a pound of sugar for fools and their money are soon parted
TheSilphRoad,removed,extremely
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here i posted it on rpokemongo but the mods are ridiculous and they removed it
TheSilphRoad,removed,how fast and with how much regularity even at the worst speedlock which as you noted was roughly id still occasionally hit something around same went for when it was around occasionally would hit something on the highway around seriously hoping they lightened up on this above all else have to do a lot of driving and travel around a bit and this made it a bit more entertaining without sacrificing safety with the plus at least also happened to be the straw that caused me to lose damn near all interest in playing since it was no longer simply integrated into my daily life but would force me to go intentionally to play and kill time i dont have
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsgithubcomwolfsblvtblossomspokemongomanagerreleases zero reported bans
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel like it got worse
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a shiny pokemon if you transfer it you will get candy times but is you make it your buddy and walk for it will turn into the legendary bird that represents your team
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont forget that different areas can be dangerous for different people in the us for example affluent white neighborhoods and suburbs are often very dangerous for young men of color because residents can be quick to call police and police can be quick to respond with violence so it would be great to mark those kinds of affluent areas as dangerous as well

TheSilphRoad,removed,ummm obvious fucken stuped photoshack buddy
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wouldnt trust niantic with a dime till they fix the basics of the game its absurdly boring repetitive and nothing like its namesake gameplaywise
TheSilphRoad,removed,the best part is thats my local sub im the guy on there calling everyone pussies for being afraid of homeless people ayyo o
TheSilphRoad,removed,its niantic they will fumble the ball
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok
TheSilphRoad,removed,this game is so balanced
TheSilphRoad,removed,nice try bro
TheSilphRoad,removed,player level eggs hatched lapras caught lapras seen for reference i live in san francisco but mainly play in oakland berkeley and san leandro because thats where my friends play those areas are miles from san francisco in terms of rare catches i have caught aerodactyl snorlax dragonite but plenty of dratini and dragonair
TheSilphRoad,removed,i will never understand why anyone would name their title quick question dont upvote its like you dont know what upvoting means and you give zero idea of your question from the title
TheSilphRoad,removed,not common players seem to hate cheaters in us
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually i just figured it was a stupid question that had already been asked a million times i just couldnt find anything through the search function
TheSilphRoad,removed,level hatched eggs not sure how many eggs also not sure how to check that stat seen in the wild vallejo and caught it iv with second best moveset and hatched
TheSilphRoad,removed,this should probably be posted and answered in rpokemondev but here goes two elements determine if pokemongo can remain active in the background ram and gps services pokemongo will retain active until its allocated ram is depleted for being a background app at which point it will kill itself and the left over ram will be allocated to whatever program you opened into the foreground on android forcing a program to stay in the foreground is realitively easy there are numberous settings and apps that can assist in this unfortunately you use the worst phoneos on the planet so your ability to manipulate memory allocation is limited unless the appstore has a program that can do this you would most likely need a jailbreak to achieve it gps location service will stop receiving confirmation pings once a program is moved to the background this impedes your ability to work on eggs while texting or whatever even if pokemongo remains alive in background serverside will not have an accurate reading on your locationhowever on android there is several programs that can force your gps to lock on regardless of a program being moved back and forth to foreground gps services will continue to sendreceive location pings via wifi mobile or gps radio i do not think crapple iphones have any programs to assist in gps locking and if they do you would require a jailbreak tldr short answer you own an iphone your options are limited go buy a real mans phone
TheSilphRoad,removed,you you can zoom out well fuck me til
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyre looking for people who scrape server side data not client side data pogobagme is probably safe because it scrapes client side data not server data
TheSilphRoad,removed,they are more worried about getting rid of people than they are about keeping the what few people are left much priorities such wow
TheSilphRoad,removed,im level and ive maxed the following all iv percentages from when pokeadvisor was a thing wigglytuff with poundhyper beam my main gym attacker gyarados with dragon breathhydro pump gym defender mostly because he looks intimidating and dragonite counter victreebell with razor leafsolar beam vaporeon slayer raichu with sparkthunder i just like it and its good against water guys if i dodge properly arcanine with fire fangflamethrower grass and ice counter but often left in gyms snorlax with lickbody slam usually just tossed in a gym along with a bunch of my teammates high cp snorlaxes not many people feel like spending the time to take those down
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks like they arent banning iv checking
TheSilphRoad,removed,so they can track what sites we are using without even having an app downloaded but they cant fix their botched from spaggheti code step tracker for over a month seems legit
TheSilphRoad,removed,so will i be banned for using go radar thats pretty scary
TheSilphRoad,removed,anyone else have trouble reading that the white background with the white font made it very hard too much to ask for a darker font
TheSilphRoad,removed,so is goradar safe
TheSilphRoad,removed,go radar and skiplagged app
TheSilphRoad,removed,it shows exact location disappearance time and iv pretty functional i think
TheSilphRoad,removed,so basically an amnesty on people who used iv checkers up to this point in time
TheSilphRoad,removed,the constant ballsucking is annoying niantic started the game in a garbage state they are still in am state where the game is incredibly boring for people not living near any hotspots so just stop it we have any right to critize this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,we dont thats why we critize the game and get pissed on by people that live in pokemon heaven
TheSilphRoad,removed,and dats a booty
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah that trainer is a skank that ruins it for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes they totally ruined the game litterally unplayable
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont man i just find it hard to believe that all these people showing elekid smooching and magby picked up a egg right after the announcement was made and from that time til now walked to hatch it and now showing they got these mons it was only maybe hours between the announcement made and now right so these guys walked within that hours im mostly wrong but i just find it a bit bizarre
TheSilphRoad,removed,when i have egg i normally have it for atleast a couple of day before it hatches but maybe thats just me like someone said above maybe some people have more time to dedicate to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyone knows im a spoofer are you late to the party also i wasnt complaining i was inquiring theres a difference if i was complaining then i wouldve used harsher words and blamed people know the difference
TheSilphRoad,removed,you say that like as if i care about your respect hahah shove that respect where the sun dont shine no one cares
TheSilphRoad,removed,the event is terribly underwhelming
TheSilphRoad,removed,this event feels so wrong that i canbet nia will rush to add some fun just to save face
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wasnt complaining i was inquiring you need extra brain cells to know the difference mate
TheSilphRoad,removed,where did i imply they are spoofing you really need them extra brain cells first u cant tell the difference between complaining and inquiring and now you are imagining things
TheSilphRoad,removed,from the ops quote i was under impression that most of the pogo stuff from niantic would come during december probably including gen i could be wrong though
TheSilphRoad,removed,im done with his game
TheSilphRoad,removed,electabuzz is still pretty good with thunder as its charge move magmar makes a decent lapras counter although i dont see it in gyms much anymore im ok with hatching a frost breath jynx it shreds dragonites
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly i can just evolve it for an extra after the hatch and then never use it in gyms this is an improvement if anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually i can used the as decent prestigers electabuzz is pretty great against water types and jynx with ice moves is also great against dragonites magmar can somewhat counter a lapras
TheSilphRoad,removed,wouldve been nice if misty was holding togepi
TheSilphRoad,removed,give it to him man hed love it ive spoofed all over the world and not even a soft ban just make sure when you log out of your acc that you give it atleast hours or so to be safe before you let him log in accross another continent from niantics point of view as far as their record shows you just travelled to us thats all ive done it few times to catch the region exclusives and harvest lapras in japan still nothing youll be fine
TheSilphRoad,removed,since when did this place become rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,i googled pokestop map and the first result was the website
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is not the christmas event
TheSilphRoad,removed,fall ack kid your a clown i hate people like you you suck
TheSilphRoad,removed,with delibird as a regional exclusive for all of your bombing needs
TheSilphRoad,removed,i froze my ass off training against a snorlax the other day getting a gym from to happily the gym is still safe in our handsits even colder and you cant drive to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i did another post talking about the increase but almost no one wanted to understand and try to believe what i discovered the image above is almost a confirmation of this one more surprise that niantic did every minute i see some facebook twitter post from people saying they just captured a snorlax today i also captured mine in an unlikely spawn location if you do not believe it do not worry youll also capture yours snorlax by christmas and youll understand that what im talking about is true
TheSilphRoad,removed,well no point sticking them it would just be sad to have it sit there forever doing nothing niantic will never implement community suggestions
TheSilphRoad,removed,no im not bundle of sticks
TheSilphRoad,removed,same device ive seen him a few times but if he ever kicks me out ill take his phone and delete his best pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh you must be a professional poker player so you have a better understanding of variance just kidding youre just a dick
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah
TheSilphRoad,removed,ugh shut up with these stupid gd posts already gyms are fine if you dont like lvl gyms sitting in your neighborhood go remove them thread

TheSilphRoad,removed,found a ditto udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,speak for yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,this sub is just the mirror version of rpokemongo equally circlejerky only in the opposite direction equally incompetent to admit there are merits flaws in this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,was the same for me then i was visiting a client in another city and it appeared on the radar during smoking break had a lot of weird looks when i ran away but i had to do it
TheSilphRoad,removed,httppokemondbnettype attack type goes leftright defend type goes updown
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have a question on what to do after i already finish training the gym up do you use a second account from a different team to kick your low cp pokemon out of the gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are three kinds of dd players lawful neutral and chaotic it is up to you what you consider cheating as has been discussed on many threads here i dont and never did consider trackers cheating and i wont be spending more money on this game until some kind of third party or niantic tracker is working again if it makes you feel better many of these cheaters have spent tons of money on this game like on the lures you were using
TheSilphRoad,removed,although i abhor botters and spoofers this kind of cheating is very soft if a big if the player plays legit in all other ways i really cant blame them for using a account to have a shot at getting into gyms with the nowridiculous training system my general rule is that if you play the game as it is meant to be played then the whole account thing is really irrelevant since youre still playing the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes can i do this even though someone else already has
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is not a defense of cheating but more or an attack on niantic i loved playing when this game first came out i went out every day for a month catching everything i could the second month i barely played it got really old catching pigeys and ratatas and eevees one day i found a charmander that was pretty cool how id ever get enough candies to evolve one i dont even know i was level and a pokédex of i stopped playing but i can see how people would want to cheat pokemon is something millions of people love and want to play regardless how shitty the game is perhaps if you didnt just throw pokeballs times a day at the same pokemon you already have of people wouldnt have urge to bot perhaps if more pokemon were available in more areas people wouldnt have the urge to spoof to santa monica or central park theres always going to be cheaters but its usually a pretty niche group create a game that people love but dont actually want to play and that group is going to get really big really fast
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats not cheating
TheSilphRoad,removed,out of curiousity how did the other people cheat again i couldnt tell from your comments gps spoof scanners multiacct if its the scanners i think they actually take away from the experience as knowing where everything is sorta makes the game less fun no surprisemoment of ohhappy i have tried seen and saw how they work and have actually deleted the i was introduced to while playing even before they stopped working from my phone since they take away the fun factor for me i suppose if youre someone who is ok not having a dragonite me then you dont mind too much not using them most people dont frown on scanners since the tracking feature is impossible to use now with only minutes to track something down without pure luck or scanners or simply asking people perhaps its not possible to find something in sightings imo and one of the messed up things in the game and why people probably even resort to scanners i hope all the gps spoofers are banned at least and i dont mind the driving folks if thats what they want to do with winter coming sorta hard for half the country to go out there and walk in rain and snow honestly to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,and reddit well cry just because theyre high levels and have good pokemon doesnt mean they cheat
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can just put an ad on ebay stating i trade my dnite for € then we just meet trade pidgey for dnite give me € end there will be money involved
TheSilphRoad,removed,based on there are already bottrained accounts being sold on ebay at around a pop right now the possibility of accounts being banned means that the hacked and cheated goods are contained in the offending account when trading comes about unless they have some kind of originally caught by account identifier attached to each mon hacked mons will be even easier to get away with and therefore make money out of
TheSilphRoad,removed,i generally find trackers app hard to use cheating is so subjective some people say using party trackers is cheating some people say its not meh
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracking isnt cheating spoofing is
TheSilphRoad,removed,reporting does absolutely nothing dont waste your time
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wish you mentioned some examples of wayst hey cheated i only know of spoofing and multi accounts myself what more is there i dont really count trackermaps as cheats myself but i guess you could count that in as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes woo hoo
TheSilphRoad,removed,im ready to evolve my charmeleon but i dont want to fuck it up
TheSilphRoad,removed,this it saves on potions and revives too sidenote i wish theyd fix the combat system this just isnt pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,it doesnt matter if they leave they will just come back when trading is available and sell their stuff or they can just sell their account when they leave and make a profit now
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,meanwhile rural areas of the us are crying bitter tears of jealousy
TheSilphRoad,removed,shouldnt the totally legit san fransisco tracker as this point considered cheating since niantic dosent seem to have any plans to implement that type of tracker worldwide its hard to compete with sf players who gets theirs mons served on a silver platter im getting mixed logic from niantic on this matter
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre so wrong there is already a massive market for bot leveled accounts people buying accounts that are already level its pathetic
TheSilphRoad,removed,a tracker with an arrow and meter distance was literally in the promo materials the three foot tracker was supported by niantic cheating
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol if some stranger tried to show me his pokemon at the park id be backing away slowly
TheSilphRoad,removed,ubozobozo should really share that info with us so we can help report him mass reporting gets niantics radar much easier
TheSilphRoad,removed,no niantec does not say party trackers are against there tos if your party tracker is a friend who found a mon theres nothing wrong with that they say trackers that hack their api are cheating if someone else finds a rare and shares it in a group chat our gym battling chat has hardcore players it effectivity functions the same as api hack apps but is not against tos some may call that cheating just like some call bubblestrat or gps drifting cheating i can easily collect plus from drift a day im not going to say its not cheating but it isnt against tos just saying someone ischeating isnt enough to have an intelligent discussion on the matter im sure cheating no matter how its defined contributes to op lagging behind but im not sure cheating gives as much of an advantage as coordinating with others does missing out on stardust and coins a day hurts more then having some extra snorlax your quite capable of gym battling with vapes and executer
TheSilphRoad,removed,everytime there is an update niantic provides us more reasons to stop playing this game how generous of them
TheSilphRoad,removed,its fair to call it cheating but a tracker encourages me to go outside way more often since ill actually be rewarded rather then uselessly walking around randomly i guess if it doesnt fit you dont use it though
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto better late than never
TheSilphRoad,removed,q is ditto in the pokemon go app yet a nope though rumor has it its coming soon says who
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto udronpes ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,haha plenty of people who didnt cheat are shocked people still play too im looking at my wife right now so im not sure how much merit that sentiment has for the record i useused trackers and am still having a blast
TheSilphRoad,removed,you cant possibly say that since you didnt cheat i know many mid players who use trackers and still dont have a complete dex i think thats the hang up casuals see hard core players way ahead of them and think its because they cheated no theyre way aread of them because they played times as much hardcore players know how ridiculous it is to complete a dex or trying to use niantecs tracker tool and have accepted that uaing a separate tracking feature while technically tos isnt the worst thing in the world and isnt likely to diminish the experience of others similar to driving mph over the speed limit

TheSilphRoad,removed,ditto udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes digging for ditto way out here payed off
TheSilphRoad,removed,stoppppp
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes still dont know if only the first one matters per post but why not
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic does not care if you have fun playing their game or die they just want your money hand it over and nobody will get hurt
TheSilphRoad,removed,definitely ditto udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,it would be useful if youd actually tell us what kind of cheats they talked about as people have different thresholds for what they consider acceptable as far as im concerned botting and spoofing are the only things that are low because youre not actually going out and getting the mons yourself whereas something like a tracker is not worth fussing about having to wander around completely blind is a huge turnoff for a lot of players and id rather have them playing than holding off for some trivial sense of honor when natural advantages such as having more free time a better area to play in and spawns or stops at your homejob can be way more impactful
TheSilphRoad,removed,well it depends on what you feel is cheating i personally dont see feel party applications such as trackers and scanners as cheating they are were available to anyone used by just about everyone who playsed no special skill is required to use them and they augment game play rather than change it i also have mixed feelings about the location spoofers true enough it is easier to look at this and call it cheating or to feel that is it unfair to those that dont spoof but really this game has no natural balance it is heavily biased to those that live andor work in dense urban areas those of us that dont really cant compete with those that do before the api was changed i was doing some work in the downtown area so i subscribed to a downtown twitter feed that would tweet out the location of rare spawns every week there were multiple snorlax dragonite muk etc etc in the very small downtown area even without the twitter feed or scanners just walking around at lunch time yielded poke stops gyms and at least rares a day compare that to my suburban home and normal office area and i dont see any of that period like you i have to drive to parks to see much even in the way of common spawns and a few pokestops even if the cheats never existed there is no possible way that i can compete with those that live andor work in urban areas all my local gyms are dominated by players who work in areas that allow them to do well and bring those big pokes back to suburbs and hold them down for weeks so is that location spoofer who puts themselves in central park for a few hours each day gaining an unfair advantage or just trying to level the playing field and compete with those that live and work in the golden zones
TheSilphRoad,removed,congrats on paying for the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,saw someone on a certain anonymous forum state i have caught snorlax seen lapras caught seen i just cant even
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres no real competing though its mostly just walking around and your getting exercise so its a win wheres the problem
TheSilphRoad,removed,ditto udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,you and i sound pretty similar dragonites i thought the way fast poke map worked was really reasonable as i pretty much only used it when something was on radar and i was on foot it didnt feel degenerate just a way for me to maximize the time i spent outside but i came to it late and it had a short lifespan from what i can tell i guess my point is i think he game could benefit from some improved ingane tracking even if it was a limited resource eg once per day or purchased through coins so you could find that irritating mon
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes another ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre not the only one thats kinda the main thing about cheaters in a non pvp game
TheSilphRoad,removed,pointless like much of pogo
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just got the last candy needed for my muk and evolved it now the only one missing is alakazam i buddied abra after evolving muk and hope for an abra nest coming with the next migration sadly due to fpm being down again i couldnt find an abra which was nearby when going home
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont mind trackers personally spoofers on the other hand suck i am more than willing to use the tracker to tell me where to go then go there in person spoofing in my opinion is a far more serious and cheapening offence
TheSilphRoad,removed,got a ditto when i upvoted udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,party tracker is hardly cheating anyway when compared to what real cheaters do
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,its so sad that these truly memorable and fantastic aspects of the game are what niantec is trying to kill by banning tracking sites
TheSilphRoad,removed,see i dont mind the party trackers as long as im still physically getting to the location we used to use the intel map when playing ingress and it made the entire experience so much more fun nbsp the map would tell you roughly where people that were playing were physically located based on the last ingame action theyd done like attacking a portal etc this lead to a lot of encounters with the other team or being able to easily catch up to your team while youre out an about playing nbsp i find the party trackers do sort of the same thing you run into groups of people you may have never met because youre all at this one spot for the same pokemon once a decent tracking system is in game or niantic make something similar to the intel map then ill likely change my mind on party trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,um when i upvoted this post i got a ditto so udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,hmmm just went on a mile walk and picked up just as many spawns as usual within ft of the major road i was walking along at least half a dozen havent seen a change in my local known spawnpoints in the past week either i wouldnt consider this a global change without a lot more data
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongodev
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,well if they are reading my best chance to reach them is right now please bring back the footsteps most fun ive ever had out at a park since i was a kid either that or pay uisaacwdavis to create an official compass for your app thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not that important but then neither are perfect ivs perfect ivs just make your pokemon better than other peoples pokemon if being further behind isnt important then what scrape of a mankeys ass does it matter that you poke has atk and not ivs basically mean more at the higher levels when youre going to be interacting with other high level players in a sense ivs are less important than not falling behind now im not suggesting that being low level or falling behind or playing casually is bad take whatever pleasure you can get from the game play it however you want with whatever goals you want but its basically a question about grinding for ivs and whether its worth giving up the luck theyve had so far and whether theyll end up with as good a set of stuff in a few weeks im saying as long as youre grinding you may as well grind efficiently and falling behind is a factor to take into account what happens if a feature is introduced that only level can do the way you have to be over level to take a gym falling behind is not something i personally worry about i live in a rural area ill never be in even the top of semi serious players but i do enjoy being able to take down gyms being roughly competitive and having the flexibility there for future developments not falling behind is just an ancillary side benefit of doing the same thing but less efficiently im done grinding level pidgeys and rattatas because im rural and cant spare the pokeballs ill never not pick up a common though when the candy is so easy im not here to tell you what enjoyment you should get from the game if you only want to go up one level every three months then i personally dont really have an opinion the difference it would make to me though is that if i care about collecting and perfection then a iv pokemon at is always going to be better than a iv pokemon at with the same moveset and thats what leveling will always make better when you grind for weeks at a time the cp numbers going up is pretty much the main variable changing and therefore a large factor in any excitement youre getting out of any changes ill always go wow ive never seen a in the wild before in a game as grindy as this its basically new pokes and new levels of those pokes that are changing
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe if someone edited the screen shot and used red arrows in paint or something to point out what is being talked about that would help this is the most stupid ive felt since downloading this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres a local gym near me where thers pokemons and all about pretty sure half of them are cheaters and no one including me in the area can be bothered taking that fkin gym its been about weeks they use to own more gyms in the area as well but those got taken down the gym they hold is kinda in an awkward location so no one wants to stand there for minutes using resources taking the gym down when there are a few other gyms nearby
TheSilphRoad,removed,there have been hundreds of noncheating level for quite some time
TheSilphRoad,removed,there have been hundreds of level for quite some time
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate the whole battle system there is hardly any strategy behind it if your game is lagging it is pointless to even attempt to dodge i really hope that this tap tap tap battle system is just temporary
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use both pokeradar and go radar more go radar
TheSilphRoad,removed,why do so many people get this wrong its one of the only great errors that immediately gets me to downvote a comment its not a misspelling its a completely different word
TheSilphRoad,removed,pinsir wimbledon park clefairy less frequent wimbledon park bulbasaur very fucking frequent holland park magikarp london south bank i can do more upon request
TheSilphRoad,removed,on my one hatched as well too months until i maybe have enough to evolve it into a sub leveled dragonite with shit moves probably last eggs have been eeveepinsireevee pinsiri sleep at night because at least they werent onix though
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is primarily a spelling issue the vast majority of people who type loose when they mean lose would not make that mistake when speaking
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh well you better downvote me then
TheSilphRoad,removed,brb trading my butterfree to this dude i met on my cruise ship he seems to really like trading
TheSilphRoad,removed,does this also work when soft banned i wonder lol make a account teleport to a high density lured pokestop like the pier in san francisco and waste pokeballsxd
TheSilphRoad,removed,which is exactly what they should be doing its beyond me why the fuck the messaging app get slowed down with each successive ios update
TheSilphRoad,removed,ivs remain constant through evolutions a charmander will evolve into a charizard a charmander will end up a charizard when you use pokemon iv calculators even if u used it correctly it just gives you an estimate and a range of possible ivs hence when you evolve you may find that the calculator gives a slightly different iv range the actual iv hasnt changed there is no fully legit way to find out a pokemons iv accurately and easily because the game hides key information that can only be obtained by accessing serverside information there are apps that can do this for you like this but technically using it is against tos you are very unlikely to get banned for using it but its within niantics rights to do so
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey im updating my site httpspokemongodpsoptimizerherokuappcom to calculate this as soon as i get home today
TheSilphRoad,removed,after you pay six bucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,to sell bag upgrades next
TheSilphRoad,removed,search
TheSilphRoad,removed,moving grass needs to be readded distance and maybe also direction need to be displayed no exact location bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont want hats
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope they make changes to it showing the exact location takes away all adventure and turns getting from point a to point b into a chore spawning at pokestops takes a lot of the fun out of the game as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,this reads like how a year d talks
TheSilphRoad,removed,i care about people typing moronic redditisms to look trendy look guys i gae the joke
TheSilphRoad,removed,the magikarp strategy works with any low cp pokemon low cp pokemon are very easy to kill here you seem to have trouble reading here is your absolutely awful incorrect advicestatement which has nothing to do with magikarps by instead putting in something super low something that no one can beat with something even lower things with low cp are not hard to beat with pokemon that have lower cp things with low cp are not hard to beat with pokemon that have lower cp is this getting through to you i cant imagine being in the same room as you you are insufferable cry me a river preferably without also giving bad advice in a popular subreddit so i dont have to correct your wrong advice when you do
TheSilphRoad,removed,no you dont
TheSilphRoad,removed,in ingress youre allowed to put in a request to chance sides but you lose all of your ap exp and start at lvl one though i believe you retain all of your badge statsmedals and achievements i assume youd also lose all of your pokemon but at least youd have the knowledge of how to play and strategies to implement when leveling if youre under lvl it really shouldnt be hard at all to get back to that with a few lucky egg evo sessions as thats the soft cap anyt not terrible but it is a huge deterrent and makes it more of a last option or a onetimeonly thing im instinct and definitely the minority in my town but i love being the underdog and was the entire reason i picked team yellow when we first found out about the three teams i knew i would love this team and then came the swaglord spark memes omg i fuckin love em i didnt really care for the other two teams when i found out about them but now considering the storylinescharacter traits i am more happy with yellow than before
TheSilphRoad,removed,where at
TheSilphRoad,removed,can anyone confirmdeny that this effects the use of things like httpswwwpgnexusgg i use it to check ivs for its convenience but it is technically a third party program that access the api
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you guys want to report people check this here bunch of people using bots blatently maybe they have their usernames in their pictures that they post
TheSilphRoad,removed,wellp goodbye friends it was nice finding out that the dratini i caught last night was ivs oh well we had a good run maybe ill be able to get enough candies to take him to dragonite before i get banned o
TheSilphRoad,removed,you botters are the scum of this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i completely agree with the banning of players that are spoofing teleporting botting and many other things i completely disagree with the banning of players that are using party apps to determine iv as this is a stat that makes a difference in the combat capabilities of a pokemon and directly impacts the gameplay how convenient
TheSilphRoad,removed,screw that downvote him into oblivion
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can try to justify it any way youd like but in the end youre a cheater whether it impacted anyone elses experience or not is irrelevant any cheating in any multiplayer game is wrong period
TheSilphRoad,removed,hahaha i am running bots and of them get error so that mean i have account safe and they are all level so i am going to take one and play legit save me from gg ezi peazi
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,me too lost interest in the game when everyone started botting i tried to bot just to se how unfair it was for granted i only botted for a day or so but that account is not banned and i was not sly about it pretty much jumped from australia to china to the us if they really ban the actual botters i might pick the game up again even if that means i have to start with a fresh account
TheSilphRoad,removed,just created new account and testing it on a bot for about all seems fine no errorproblem showing on the bot let see how it goes by the end of the day
TheSilphRoad,removed,mygobot users dont seem to have been banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,im happy and worried at the same time pllleease dont touch fellow pokeadvisors
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean we have the math they cant ban you from going to a website and calculating your ivs good job keeping them hidden all they are doing is creating a bigger gap between the casual player and the player that will look up ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,carefull using rape analogies is apparent aberrant to the dicksucking cheaters who as you can see will vote you down big time but you speak the truth apparently being butt hurt is okay but raped is not
TheSilphRoad,removed,i had that pokenotifications once but ive deleted it a while back am i gucked
TheSilphRoad,removed,you found the eastereggg also ive not seen anyone mention this yet but you can throw pokeballs and potions heal you
TheSilphRoad,removed,why are people about basic functionality youre literally just describing an obvious function of the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,god forbid there should be some sort of useful online users guide
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol you can restart the app duh like or times duh
TheSilphRoad,removed,aggggghhhh seriously the bug is making it difficult to play loads fail i do software for a living and this failure rate is so obvious and annoying it it beyond my comprehension that this is not a top priority
TheSilphRoad,removed,so essentially we need to make the feedback entertaining for them to even bother reading
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh sure says the wag that lives in belgium isnt the hague almost next door if they dominate the world youre going to want them in court easy for you to write i hear the evil laugh dont even pretend you dont have one i am dying to know why you chose your name its got to have a funny story to go with it
TheSilphRoad,removed,except that people do need that commodity to live sometimes its okay to want enough not too much just enough
TheSilphRoad,removed,trainer tips has no inside knowledge he throws out lots of stuff thats not true and likes to title his videos with click bait like a week ago when he titled his video how to find ditto a week later he hasnt even found ditto karmas a bitch
TheSilphRoad,removed,the tracker makes no sense stop spreading lies
TheSilphRoad,removed,its amazing how they repeat a mistake they fixed with the old nearby
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokealert still works wonders and can even find dittos read up on his it works and try it out
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep im so glad they made finding pokémon easier for people with plenty of pokestops around them especially these new pokémon these pokestop filled city living people really needed the help out of anyone pray for the city people use rural and suburban players will be fine knowing a hoothoot is away at an old church off a busy state road with no sidewalks
TheSilphRoad,removed,or we could just go back to the original tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,i miss tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,the entire premise of this stupid tracker is only worth anything if it has stops regardless id rather get to actually track down pokemon and not be spoon fed their exact location
TheSilphRoad,removed,i must have found half a dozen rattata nests yesterday
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks me later
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic updates page the nearby feature expands reach the nearby feature holds back lame
TheSilphRoad,removed,not me just restarted game i am still blind live in suburban town with pokestops downtown but not in residential areas we are still fooked damn you niantic and your hateful actions
TheSilphRoad,removed,the evidence is right in all our hands located on our middle finger this affects all of us
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive got a flareon a flareon and a flareon ive got a jolteon my best vaporeon i feel your pain
TheSilphRoad,removed,looked at the edit history looks like it was care to track this person
TheSilphRoad,removed,ehh the post did say doesnt change much or is actually a worse option that coin bounty isnt a bad idea but probably wouldnt change much
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am a bot on behalf of reddit i would like to thank you for your honesty we live in harried times honesty is in short supply thats why when you go out of your way to assure the reddit community that your comment is honest i honestlybot have made it my mission to thank you
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are a couple that actually arent bad this is one that id be okay with im just salty from having to read bad solutions over and over
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is already built into the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,for being on reddit for years youd think you know how to use the search bar by now
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just down vote every one of those threads i come across they also get hidden as well after a vote
TheSilphRoad,removed,pro tip there is a feature that allows you to reply to existing thread you dont need to create a new thread and then refer to post thread that you are replying to
TheSilphRoad,removed,all of this
TheSilphRoad,removed,its almost like everything about the gym system is terrible
TheSilphRoad,removed,fallacy this game provides no avenue within itself to do what you prescribe proof i am correct this topic will do nothing to stop the very real problem of gym stagnation offer significantly more xp to knock down a high level gym and perhaps just perhaps some progress can be madr
TheSilphRoad,removed,gyms suck anyway just in the whole design
TheSilphRoad,removed,i thought there was a cap does that mean that all these gym players are all spoofhackers in thailand almost all the gyms have dragonites i cant imagine a single player accumulating like dragonites
TheSilphRoad,removed,thought it was a vajayjay
TheSilphRoad,removed,hahahah i bet someone did lick their phone 😆
TheSilphRoad,removed,your observation is laughably wrong its way easier to build a level gym than knock it down
TheSilphRoad,removed,disallow idea posts in general theyre a waste of space
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks op now i know a good place to spoof s
TheSilphRoad,removed,what happened to this sub smugging over rpokemongo attitude and then becoming rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats more none of them have any chance of working since people dont seem to be able to understand that stagnation is an inevitable and emerging property of a game with a declining player base
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes please kill the smogon banwhore mentality in pogo before it grows and develops language skills
TheSilphRoad,removed,my bad just getting frustrated with content from rpokemongo users which are simply extremely low or false content stealth brags about how they have the statistically proven top attackers in the game this entire post could be boiled down to play the game longer than the other team and you will win
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,is yoh not using the search function new before you have a stupid question you should refer to the faq and search function stop wasting our time
TheSilphRoad,removed,this sub should gat a bonus for the times this question has been asked
TheSilphRoad,removed,i always felt comfortable with the poké silhouettes but fuck me goldeens really messed with my head obscure fishy bitch
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i dont know who decided that censoring something ad benign as a would be a good idea on a sub meant for morons its ridiculously annoying
TheSilphRoad,removed,try the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,and in answer to your last question from what weve seen the displacement is constant at least it was for the days we recorded it specifically mine was at the same position about miles away for over a day maybe hours im going from memory now not going to look up my notes
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn my plans to corner people in dark alleys and read poetry to them has been foiled
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate dont upvote in post titles just ask your question without trying to use thinly veiled reverse psychology to garner attention
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you serious go to the search bar and type in pokemon dps and see the first post smh
TheSilphRoad,removed,its got more tryhards who get pissy if you write something funny they also love downvoting
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres probably about nests people pay any attention to in the area i live it would take several hours to confirm each one given some only have a couple spawns would have to stay there at least minutes to confirm and a few are quite remote
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe at your place not at mine
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic used latency it was super effective
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is that one post every that makes this sub worth to read even if it means sifting through variations of psa last update made happen more often i have a sample size of
TheSilphRoad,removed,why not new content who cares about text fixes or the less than of players using the apple watch
TheSilphRoad,removed,gen confirmed hehe bring on the downvotes
TheSilphRoad,removed,we havent gotten an updat in like a month an update is not minor text fixes or bug fixes or releasing in a new territory an update is actual stuff added to the game like gen pokemon shiny pokemon new modesitems etc niantic has been slacking off big time
TheSilphRoad,removed,android users are the biggest cheaters in the game i could care less about stuff working for them they shouldnt even had the game day one in the first place
TheSilphRoad,removed,all you sappy tiddlywinkers this man is a peasant to the extreme you just wanted some milf action perv or so a justice warrior would say you get no kudos from me i say youre just another below struggling to help those worse off how sad
TheSilphRoad,removed,this game is in desperate need of a major content injection i wonder how much longer theyll hold out on delivering it
TheSilphRoad,removed,eggs hatched the following mons that ive never seen in the wild eggs snorlax lapras fbice beam aerodactyl porygon electabuzz chancey hitmonchan lickitung togepi tangela did see on nearby back in aug plus all of my iv mons and most of the or so mons i regularly use in gyms either hatched or have been candyfed through egg hatchings have collected my share of shit movesets but i love rng
TheSilphRoad,removed,an update full of nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,another reason this is a positive update bot devs are cracking the new apis in less then hours keep them busy niantic the less time we have bots out and about the better the game is
TheSilphRoad,removed,who is they a considerable amount of people here use trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,but guys the game is dead
TheSilphRoad,removed,so instead of letting someone who enjoys the gymming mechanic put something worthwhile in a gym you snipe it with your pidgey so it can get killed in a minute people like you annoy me just because youre upset you cant hold a gym for more than a couple hours doesnt mean you should take that challenge away from someone else
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think users are not yet able to send codes at least i am not but my account was not completely verified yet anyways they are currently limiting use to keep the servers stable unlike that other pokémon service so id assume that youll have to be patient a bit longer btw does not work anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,amazing how much depth this smartphone app actually has thank you
TheSilphRoad,removed,found in the datamine items templateid pokemon troll curveball rate
TheSilphRoad,removed,im glad to see they are assuring their investors before the paying customer
TheSilphRoad,removed,this will kill they game almost definitely if you lose gyms after mins of having it people will stop going to gyms i already have i have interest in taking over gyms right now other than getting gold every day i take over gym pop my my defender bonus and move on its impossible to stack the defender bonus because by the time i hit another gym my other one is gone please tell me what the point is please explain to me what the point is this game is absolutely geared only toward casual players right now people that want to put more time into it are desperately looking for more to do other than grinding pidgeys and leveling up and being stuck with some people have already found every available pokemon and are on their way to level which is the speculated current level cap what do these people do after that
TheSilphRoad,removed,where is this comment so i can go downvote it because thats just silly
TheSilphRoad,removed,i say we nuke them from orbit its the only way to be sure
TheSilphRoad,removed,stupid try overwhelmingly incompetent did you know that you cant curse at all or automod deletes your comment
TheSilphRoad,removed,one paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawnch
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah your logic is flawed to say the least china doesnt want the game waiting on countries to allow the game will lose niantic money plus if they release it mid feb thats a few weeks of winter
TheSilphRoad,removed,probably because it implies the existence of the evil pokemon beyond
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpimgurcomameayz i did it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i say we all go over there and post high quality content until they die
TheSilphRoad,removed,u could spoof yea its cheating and all but what do u have to lose anyways if youre already thinking about quiting
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you have a source at niantic where did you get this info psa korean language is code for gen s
TheSilphRoad,removed,its time to quit i know its hard to give up what you invested but sometimes you gotta cut your losses it sounds like you dont have the time to be a serious gym competitor even if you were on the dominant team it looks easy to be on the dominant team but it isnt what happens when all the gyms are level but youre not in them what happens when the gyms get full of dragonites thanks to botters you got multiaccounters knocking you out of the gym to add themselves the gyms are boring and broken for everyone im on the dominant team and i couldnt stay in ten gyms for long because of this stuff i wasted as much time driving around trying to find gyms with an open spot as i actually did fighting ive since mostly quit gyms cuz the fighting was so lame anyway i stopped flushing hours per day down the toilet and havent looked back if you really want to have a gym presence start taking down the same gym per day do that for two weeks and see if you can turn it yellow if it doesnt work try a different one if you dont have time for that you dont have what it takes to get coins per day sorry its not easy
TheSilphRoad,removed,welcome to july
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just caught a pokemon by throwing a ball on it could anyone confirm this sorry
TheSilphRoad,removed,the spoofer who has taken over my pet gym is still there but my fav but rarely used pokémap is gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,they havent nailed the botters tbh just some of them and theyll create more accounts within a day where i live its literally impossible to know what is around me due to the stops a long way from home taking up all space with pidgeys and caterpies ive found a snorlax and a dragonite almost in front of my house by pure chance the radar didnt display them so god know what else have i missed before this close to the pókestops update i could play the game because even if the tracker was broken i could at least see what was close to me now i cant and pókemap was the only way id be able to do that i scanned my house to see what was close to it now i cant do that anymore and it sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont use the scanner apps because i dont have a second phone yet and im afraid to use it on my main phone but doesnt pokemap still work if downloaded before the takedown
TheSilphRoad,removed,meh if they had put this energy into making a better tracker i would be much happier
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow all the issues in the game gym errors frequent crashes broken tracker audio glitch spoofers botters snipers etc and this is what they decide to focus on pretty lame imo
TheSilphRoad,removed,the problem is not fewer spawns the problem is the chansey away from me while the game shows only pidgeyrattata
TheSilphRoad,removed,how can you say that when the game hasnt had an update in a month lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,next step ban all iv applications just because they can
TheSilphRoad,removed,lets wait till theyve nail ingame tracker maybe this century
TheSilphRoad,removed,the thing is tracker apps make the game much more enjoyable for a number of players i am sure people wouldnt use these apps if the the ingame tracker wasnt complete garbage my situation as an example i live opposite a park and it has its fair share of snorlax and lapras spawns that i just wouldnt be able to see if i didnt use a party tracker they do not appear on the ingame tracker just the not so useful pidgeys rattatas and spearows at various pokestops not that close to my apartment
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing has been done about spoofers and they are really killing the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats sad because i used pokemap regularly i admit to it but practically never to scan for pokemon only one exception every weeks after the nest changes i scanned one or two nests far away from my routine routes getting information that hours later i could get from the global nest atlas but i scanned a lot of gyms to get a feeling for gym movement who the people are in my area engaging in gym activity or when it was time to take action because mystic once again were getting a bit too strong gyms here rural are spread over a very big region with single gyms very isolated visiting them all would mean walkingrunningskatingbikingdriving kilometers if not more if i saw in pokemap that an isolated gym was captured by some people that i dont tolerate in gyms because they are certain spoofers to me i went there and kicked them out now without pokemap i dont think i will be bothered to visit those isolated gyms any more because i could get there and find that no action from my part is needed i dont need to be in those gyms because im already in more than pretty stable ones the end of pokemap means for me ill be moving less
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its not niantic misjudged the players needs they did a bad job you can hardly blame that on tracker apps
TheSilphRoad,removed,they needed months to nail botters who used apis that they knew only botters could use even after forced updates older api versions stayed usable i dont udnerstand why really they needed months to nail scanners sitting right in front of their noses also on websites in app stores how many months will they need to nail spoofers which have data traffics with niantics servers completely indistinguishable from that of legit players if they do it right my answer is never sorry but thats the truth
TheSilphRoad,removed,constructive criticism is given to constructive ideas a players gps is completely unrelated to a gym logically it makes no sense at all to implement your idea its random why dont we make the players gym rank based on the amount of pidgeys in a radius around him
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre right it shouldnt however niantic isnt putting its resources into making its tracker usable so others are putting their resources towards that end
TheSilphRoad,removed,they send an email about how to fix random stuff on your end that may have nothing to do with your issue thats usually it
TheSilphRoad,removed,a lawyer
TheSilphRoad,removed,he didnt even come close to saying that its possible to have this discussion in good faith you know you dont have to invent stuff to make someone look bad when you disagree with them
TheSilphRoad,removed,first of all what is this cheating anyway outside of gym players whom are you cheating against this is not a game with rankings or championships its a game for you to enjoy passing the time get over it of players only care about getting the pokedex filled and getting better versions of what the capture to power up heck you can have a lapras in a lv gym and can get taken out quickly so whats the issue scanners like pokemap dont hurt anyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,they would need a radical overhaul to game mechanics to get more than just a few players back supplies ballspotions are way too hard to get for most people only a small of people live in areas well served by pokestops gyms are stupid to most people by attempting to cater to casual low info players the depth just isnt there to hold most peoples interest long unless you challenge yourself above and beyond the basics of successfailure
TheSilphRoad,removed,of it was spent on driving in traffic jam
TheSilphRoad,removed,well when they put so many restrictions on how we should be playing it the least they can do is calculate it effectively theres no excuse that they cant do it either
TheSilphRoad,removed,how do we do this to make nests appear
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not the year of the dragon but nice try theyre obviously going to skip most of gen ii in favor of dropping torchic spawns for the new year s
TheSilphRoad,removed,gonna be up all night to see what the nests change into
TheSilphRoad,removed,its safe enough its cheating its your decision
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think this is the first migration that i just dont care about i dont care to catch anything that nests especially in the dead of winter
TheSilphRoad,removed,what app is that
TheSilphRoad,removed,which app is this
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyone is hopeful every single week and then theres the silence and the pidgeys and its really depressing
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one cares about your shitty account get a life
TheSilphRoad,removed,do we know any other good gym tracking app not gymhuntr that is terrible
TheSilphRoad,removed,use pokealert
TheSilphRoad,removed,um no it would be better if you talked to a few hundred friends before posting that you think this is a thing so youd realize it isnt posts of this sort show up virtually every day are invariably wrong sometimes there are more rares sometimes fewer and every other variation in between and are basically just noise that drowns out other more statistically relevant posts
TheSilphRoad,removed,but httpgymhuntrcom will help him
TheSilphRoad,removed,i say defense just because its the highest cp pokémon
TheSilphRoad,removed,would anyone be so kind as to tell me which mons dont have a nest
TheSilphRoad,removed,so you used some basic code to create a timer that is not difficult anyone here even with no experience but with an aptitude for searching could also do this it is actually quite simple sorry to rain on your parade but this is nothing more than simpleton
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive noticed increased prices for coins in the store increased boredom levels increased numbers of my buddies quitting the game and increased weeks since niantic promised the babies were start of a gen rollout but no not increased battery drain
TheSilphRoad,removed,my nest turned into prostitutes
TheSilphRoad,removed,which website is that
TheSilphRoad,removed,let the scanning commence
TheSilphRoad,removed,please stop with these ditto threads ditto is not gone it is no more rare now than it ever was
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh no i havent caught a ditto in hours the dittos are gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,no where does it read cp balance they battling more balanced by changing the cp formula calculations which they accomplished specialized attackers got a huge cp buff making them relevant attackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikinorthwestangle
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant tell where can i look it upset it
TheSilphRoad,removed,the silph road nest atlas is just a website for tracking pokemon so they wouldnt actually be able to implement this the game is actually made by programmers at company called niantic you should try contacting them instead with your suggestion
TheSilphRoad,removed,which is exactly why it would be global should niantic implement this
TheSilphRoad,removed,dedgame literallyunplayable
TheSilphRoad,removed,i recently decided to uninstall for this reason i enjoyed the game for a while really i did but its gotten to the point where i feel like all im doing is grinding for the momentary satisfaction of evolving something and that satisfaction is gone in a few hours the updates and noticeable features are too few and come too slowly for me niantics stale communication and apparent lack of genuine interaction with the playerbase just adds salt to the wound combine all of that with the freezing winter temperatures and the game just isnt fun for me anymore ive found myself logging in just to go through the motions maybe it would be more fun if i had spent money on incubators or something but ive never found the game or the company to be in a state worthy of my money
TheSilphRoad,removed,no i choose to only do facebook so any competitions show and tell etc that only uses twitter is completely pointless to be
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly beyond the gen baby pokemon this game has been lacking any real content updates for a few months already most of the updates they have done is just feature updates to bring the game up to speed to what it was supposed to be after catching my snorlax i honestly dont care anymore and have dropped the game due to the lack of anything new everything is just the same old thing every time
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol is this in erpskwerps
TheSilphRoad,removed,its the biggest reason the game feels stale niantic wont post or update the players and then the players are on edge or impatiently waiting
TheSilphRoad,removed,basically making spawns depends on cell data was the stupidest idea ever
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am in suburban minnesota and i have had the exact same experience i have a few pokestops and spawn points near my home but nothing like what i see if i go downtown or to the university i dont even bother to use my lures or incense anymore because the results are always disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,top cp attackers dragonite dbdc dragonite dbhb vape wghp vape wghp vape wghp snorlax lhb top cp defenders gyrados bhp gyrados bhp gyrados bhp gyrados bt gyrados bhp gyrados bdp
TheSilphRoad,removed,queue to ten minutes later where its a level mystic or valor gym lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokeassist is good too
TheSilphRoad,removed,current top the favorites are what i use in gyms nothing compared to most here but ive never seen a dragonite and i like variety also ive been wondering my exeggutor is iv but has attack and defense with comfusionsolar beam the only thing that seems to drag down his iv percentage is stamina is that still a good pokémon
TheSilphRoad,removed,im skeptical of them releasing trading any time soon because it fuck with their business model if you can just trade someone for a snorlax instead of having to buy incubators until you hatch one they lose money that said plenty of people will still buy incubators to keep hatching strong iv pokemon they might allow trading pokemon from the previous generations but not the current to protect revenue
TheSilphRoad,removed,how the fuck do you have so many dragonites
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats how the fuck you have so many dragonites
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes because this is what we want just give me all of gen
TheSilphRoad,removed,you realise we arent all in usa right niantic getting a bit fed up
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree completely but they arent visionaries at all they saw an opportunity to make money and they took it understaffed bloody hire more people then like yourself i saw the advertisement and was excited to go out into the world and actually live the game such a disappointment now i constantly get the youre still playing that from people like it was another flappy bird fad thanks to the underwhelming buzz they created
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is really sad to me to see how quickly this game is being washed away by poor decision making sure itll still be around with a dedicated core but if theyd just made better choices in the first few weeks they could have kept the hype going for far longer than it did its really depressing
TheSilphRoad,removed,this needs to go to the top google nintendo niantic staff and john all need to read this and reevaluate their plan of action
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe i am unlucky httpsiimgurcomvvugduvjpg is the top i have
TheSilphRoad,removed,perfect all my botting account will pay off
TheSilphRoad,removed,does httpspokeadvisorcom use api like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,there it is theres the hostility for no reason i felt it coming i am sorry that you took this personally but i have a really low tolerance for people who try to be manipulative and that blog post reeked of manipulating people who are already really upset at niantic for his own gain whats he looking for notoriety getting his name out there this is the same guy who was on twitter publicly lobbying for the open community manager gig earlier there are things they could have done to throttle bandwidth usage and while i admit that accuracy can be questionable if you live in a rural area or are trying to triangulate position based on cell towers the geolocation api is not nearly as useless as you make it out to be especially if you live in an urban area where most pokemon go players happen to be my post wasnt useless writing off an entire api with nonsense because you want to make yourself see what you believe thats useless but sit back and take a deep breath here maybe go outside for its own sake i dont think yang is a bad guy and i dont think youre a bad person i think he wrote this post while he was heated but it really doesnt look to me like anything else other than pumping his own tires
TheSilphRoad,removed,the main pokemon go sub is everything wrong with reddit complain about everything look at my gf with a pidgey xd xd xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,suburban players like myself dont find good pokemon within walking distance ive explored a lot of my area by now and unless i want to walk for about hours i cant get to the best spawns with a bike that time is halved i also commute by train and it was fun getting pokemon along the way that wont happen any more with this update
TheSilphRoad,removed,agree swimming in revives and probably dump a day i imagine team instinct may not have this problem though
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont treat himherother like a fool he didnt phrase it as an assumption he wagered get off your high horse
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed i was reading the rpokemongo thread with the imgur link which got removed and the threads been removed since all i have is my own comment reply another u with some name like pmmevaginaspls said that he had played with yang in the past in a popular game fps which he said that yang was one of the best players but had a poor rep as he was dodgy aimbotwallhack and even had a person code a bypass for fraps so that he could streamfraps without it coming up id never heard of yang beforehand while playing overwatch looking at the subreddit yangcliu came up in the form of this where he was recorded aimbotting in overwatch youll quickly see the handle is is associated with yangcliu overking ‏overwatchking come play overwatchbeta with us add and this yangcliu and ashelia are streaming playoverwatch team comps come join us httptwitchtvyanglive and didnt all the mapping sites explode from the github workapi going down in rpokemongodev especially tejados api he was just one in a rat race that garnered the most popularity others made their own maps with donation links but most users were running their own scanners based on the github projects
TheSilphRoad,removed,go back to rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,what direction is the toilet im fairly certain that is the direction this game is going
TheSilphRoad,removed,you cant read
TheSilphRoad,removed,how about you read
TheSilphRoad,removed,he said they intended to shut the site down when the tracking bug was fixed i dont believe that for a second
TheSilphRoad,removed,absolutely agree i only dodge if its a fair fight but i always stack type advantage if possible even if i know i can brute force my way through ive seen taught my wife and daughter and friendwho has been teaching his friends all the type advantagesdisadvantages and their win rates have been sky rocketing hell if you play it right you can easily take out way higher cp pokemon for fun me and my friend battled my tangela vs his lapras at his local gym it turned into a dual ko
TheSilphRoad,removed,this sub is better than rpokemongo which has essentially become
TheSilphRoad,removed,definitely however its a hard to believe when you see the behavior i see just last night when i was at the park that has gyms close together were both taken by phantom toons everyone was ragging about it because they were legit not there how can i be absolutely sure they werent because the park was empty except for people one was me and the other were even lower level than me
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is confirmed
TheSilphRoad,removed,from to
TheSilphRoad,removed,im gonna step out and willingly be that asshole today but this i have resigned from my job years ago to devote myself in android wear apps was a bad idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,shit really had no idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic already confirmed that at least this articuno and the ditto were released to games accidentally why do you keep trying to claim they were fake when niantic already said they were real hence why they revoked it it was their official statement
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i was just about to upload a great update select the search radius select scan speed if you select a scan interval lower than you might miss pokemon filter pokemon on map by rarity scan activity is now clearly shown with progress dialog rescan button and stop current scan button app is now completly idle when closed if you disable background scan option to show distance in feet
TheSilphRoad,removed,literally none of what you just said refuted my point at all the pokemon itself was real and existed in the game whether it was hacked or not is not what im debating
TheSilphRoad,removed,please tell me you were using github
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant you make the smart poke app without the google playstore
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree the same thing with candy catching a machamp should give more machop candy than a machop
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah man lets help this guy out his app is awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,glad to hear
TheSilphRoad,removed,they care losing accounts or even losing your reputation for the accounts youve sold being punished can lead to massive financial losses hit them where it hurts nope i dont level in few days just by botting sm pier i truly dont care there is no reward except the tears of the teens who cant beat my vap
TheSilphRoad,removed,its comments like these that make me so grateful for going to business school
TheSilphRoad,removed,there we go which rule did he break specifically is there a google play developer rule that says you will always obey everything written in any other google play developers app tos because if so i can release an app tomorrow that will consist of a text field that accepts a play store url and a submit button my tos will say that any play store urls that are submitted to my app are in violation of my tos and that their developers agree to remove their app from the play store or have disciplinary action taken against them by google or their parent company alphabet inc is there a google play developer rule that says you cant access another developers content without their explicit permission if so id like to suggest that we demand facebook instagram snapchat reddit youtube gmail and most especially google search be removed from the google play store as they are all facilitating the use of the restricted ip of hundredsthousands of other rights holders and developers the apple developer agreement specifically disallows use of promotional photos of apple products without their written approval unless they are being used in an official approved capacity in a very limited set of circumstances each and every picture of an iphone or ipad or apple watch that appears in a google images search is breaking that tos and any developerpublishersystem that isnt actively blocking google image web crawling on assets that have legitimate cause to use apples restricted use developer assets is violating apples tos and apple has apps on the google play store which means you guessed it all of those apps have to go and so do all apps released by the developers of those apps too because the developer account has to be terminated or is there a different set of rules when a big giant company like nintendo working with a large former google developer like niantic decide they want to make an example out of someone
TheSilphRoad,removed,just an idea but maybe you should be working within the tos instead of outside of them then you wouldnt have to worry about this kind of thing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont believe anyone who works for niantic has ever played or even seen one of the old games
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes i was pointing out that they will probably not do anything like the old games since they have thus far done nothing else like the old games this isnt a complaint or rant just pointing it out
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic broke googles tos google should do the same to them
TheSilphRoad,removed,urban areas contain fuck tons of them theres none where i live rural but we drive about minutes into the city and they are as common as pidgeys
TheSilphRoad,removed,yet the minute niantic sends user mail to a dead account its okay to cover it without suspension what a load of crap
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah honestly itd be nice if they switched the pronouns based on the avatar you chose
TheSilphRoad,removed,i totally understand the tos thing but the game is zero fun without the trackingjust seems silly of them to purge anyone trying to actually help heck it also feels like they really do not care what so ever
TheSilphRoad,removed,no this subreddit has a double standard in which they almost encourage people to use scanners
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its about being a responsible adult a responsible adult does not need an app to tell whats wrong or dangerous also busses trains passenger seats
TheSilphRoad,removed,why are they releasing a broken game in more locations fix it firstpriorities
TheSilphRoad,removed,here with a new pokeymone go glitch hax
TheSilphRoad,removed,is anyone else a little annoyed that theyre focusing on releasing a broken game to more people rather than fixing it first
TheSilphRoad,removed,even more ways to get robbed in rio
TheSilphRoad,removed,another big screw you from niantic to the community they didnt say it was a result of cheating so as far as i know this was niantics mistake
TheSilphRoad,removed,not aware of any third party tracking thats still working only found pokecompass yesterday and this morning it died
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont worry niantic only wants to stop people from legitimately playing the game they arent doing anything about hackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,naaah you know what fuck that i aint eatin your crock of shit you were using the games highly overloaded server to get the assets for your apps and using nintendos assets after you agreed not to in the google dev tos and pokemon go tos dont even say you werent hurting anyone in your venture either considering you were using others servers and assets theres no way you can even try to tell me you werent even slightly aware you were doing something wrong
TheSilphRoad,removed,also cheating has been a core component of pokemon since the first games released people actually think its okay because nintendo and gameshark made it okay decades ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,get out
TheSilphRoad,removed,my body is ready
TheSilphRoad,removed,countdown
TheSilphRoad,removed,soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,so close
TheSilphRoad,removed,wheres the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,needz it
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres pm already
TheSilphRoad,removed,can i get a code
TheSilphRoad,removed,danka
TheSilphRoad,removed,no not cool enough for being a deep web drug ring or an ancient trade route just cool enough for year old game references
TheSilphRoad,removed,i enter and it doesnt work
TheSilphRoad,removed,well its only fair since theyve limited or blocked their own app so much already
TheSilphRoad,removed,quit huffing paint then posting on reddit op
TheSilphRoad,removed,pure opinion but i think scanners have trivialized reported sightings i get more data in a day than youll report in a year and im a small fry in the scanning game nests are worth reporting though much more so once they just let us look at all nests in general
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes sorry its still very new and with the migrationspawn changes had to reset all data if you are willing to setup a scanner in your area though i will certainly add your data
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah udronpes posted the same thing days ago on post i think he does it for the karma
TheSilphRoad,removed,goat island and no idea what it is now if anything many of the nests were broken
TheSilphRoad,removed,try a scanner
TheSilphRoad,removed,since its mins from spawn to despawn you can use the time until it despawns your current time to calculate when it spawned
TheSilphRoad,removed,udohrayme im trying to make an automated nest mapping at httpwwwmanijuanascom its still in very early alpha stages though and could use much more data as i cant scan the world by myself
TheSilphRoad,removed,srsly guys none of you know that nowadays scans are all over the place if youre ios highly reccomend you pokewhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,happy cheating
TheSilphRoad,removed,is not a significant sample size
TheSilphRoad,removed,of course they would definitely tell you if they cheat
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats hitler in disguise nein nein nein
TheSilphRoad,removed,the app also closes when you push the center button near the bottom of your phone
TheSilphRoad,removed,saw this comment right as i hit back in the browser had to come back in to upvote best comment here so far
TheSilphRoad,removed,there was a person on here saying they could predict the move set by knowing the pid that would suggest that its rolled at birth they didnt provide a source or show methods
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool
TheSilphRoad,removed,they are just waiting for more players to drop out so their servers can handle the load
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol all you noobs with ur opinions and answering what has the highest cp or whatever i want to know whats better a dragonite with or a dragonite with
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol ur wrong noob
TheSilphRoad,removed,defense does not equal stan defense gives more ehp but you wouldnt even consider that cuz he a noob with a low game iq and prob low iq irl too
TheSilphRoad,removed,boo dont give ad revenue to a trump supporter
TheSilphRoad,removed,nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing wrong with me now lets get back on topic the topic is whats better a pokemon or a pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats so interesting about it sincere question all it shows is just how much in bed niantic and google are
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill verify it for a consistant dratinis every hour within say the half mile strip up and down im curious myself what qualifies something as a nest as they may justbe there because there is a super dense amount of wetlandwater spawns here and dratinis are spawn on these spawn points and were just playing the odds that out of spawn every or so pops
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont understand how they arrived at the current state of affairs and then decided it was good to go
TheSilphRoad,removed,white knights and idiots who dont believe that niantic and google are in cahoots
TheSilphRoad,removed,i only responded in kindness
TheSilphRoad,removed,also since its clear that youre okay with people talking like that but others not being able to respond i will block that user since they now know they can get away with it
TheSilphRoad,removed,poliwrath is by far the best gym defender nothing even comes close they are only as underrated as their cp total lets them be i am making an army of bubbly wraths for those nice suburban gyms to stack in eggs and dragonites stay in the city where the cp averages of gyms are high
TheSilphRoad,removed,every day lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should have wrote this months ago probably would have had less people quit in the long run
TheSilphRoad,removed,so what spawns during the day ive been tracking nests for a while now wwwmanijuanascom and have never noticed such behavior before will scan your area
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you smell that bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,okay now let us see how bad your photoshop skills are
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not real rng if there are never any patterns in it
TheSilphRoad,removed,anyone know if attack speed was left untouched
TheSilphRoad,removed,it blows loving a game that has such utterly terrible devs at the helm
TheSilphRoad,removed,jolteon isnt weak you just need to dodge its one of the most overpowered pokemon in the game because of how fast it is opponents cant get a move out and if they do it dodges every time and hits back multiple times while the opponent is on cooldown
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like how people are so dumb theyll pump way more money into items for a half finished buggy mobile game than paying outright for a finished fullfeatured awesome aaa title
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,how many losers are paying to play jesus
TheSilphRoad,removed,while were talking about moves i was evolving pokemon during my lucky egg and got this one whats the opinion on this arcanine now that both moves have been buffed httpsimgurcomaufrvv
TheSilphRoad,removed,this might get buried but im a suburban player and ive seen a more varied list of nearby pokemon im gonna keep an eye out but i did just get my first oddish
TheSilphRoad,removed,waiting on my boi qmike to carry us to victory on this one i have spent the whole day doing my best to answer this question and in my view with typecounters actually existing now pokemon with high cp and with their optimal stab movesets will pretty much all be good in most situations beacuse of this dragonite lapras vaporeon etc are still wellpositioned to be great though they should all have quality counters only problempokemon i see is dragonitelack of good steel and fairy types with anything close to comparable base statsyeah i assume lapras will still be a solid counter but what else can dewgong do it despite being at a huge cp disadvantageperlevel can snorlax still do it despite the nerfs what about something like rock throw stone edge rhydon or golem we will see
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,all along embarcadero i counted dratinis in one hour and checking periodically throughout the day i saw dragonairs not as good as rancho cordova but at least niantic hasnt forsaken norcal
TheSilphRoad,removed,so how are we supposed to hunt pokemons now radar sites only from now on
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is justwowwhy
TheSilphRoad,removed,removed footprints of nearby pokémon looks like niantic has committed to the joke that the nearby list is actually just the some pokémon that exist list
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously why would they remove the footprints
TheSilphRoad,removed,why are people so slow
TheSilphRoad,removed,god i hate the combat in this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,welp i was so excited after the balancing patch but it seems to me they are deciding to literally remove tracking from the game soo uninstalled goes the game so disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,it really kills the game not having this feature in
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow all of these changes really suck
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyll work to fix it then roll out an item that enables it for a limited amount of time
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that sucks part of the reason i havent bothered playing recently other than heat lazyness was because i couldnt tell how close some pokemon were and people have already found ways to reenable the option supposedly i guess in that case ill just be waiting for it to at least sink down to highs of low
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokevision goes down more than ops mom though
TheSilphRoad,removed,so instead of fixing the three steps they chose to change the nest before weekend comes the next spawn will not damage the game the three step will how can they not see what damage the glitch did to the whole game
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol you can do two things in this game catch pokémon and kind of battle they removed the feature that let you do one of those things properly its a disgrace
TheSilphRoad,removed,so they dont like radars but then they just decide to get rid of the footprints altogether uhhh ok then
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is terrible in nyc where there are monster tall buildings battery saving gps is more accurate than high accuracy
TheSilphRoad,removed,ffs we need someone in their team to fill us in on what theyre doing
TheSilphRoad,removed,just how many drugs did you do
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a stupid conclusion to come to lmao its currently displaying completely incorrect and useless information if its going to take them a while to fix the bug then removing that information so as not to mislead casual players who dont understand that theres a bug makes the most sense
TheSilphRoad,removed,id have quit if there werent other ways to track pokemon this guy seems really out of touch
TheSilphRoad,removed,like i said they are either removing it which is borderline insane or failing to take minutes to tweet we know all you trainers are eager for the pokemon tracking system dont worry were working on it which considering the significant fallout is equally insane either way they are way too out of touch with how they are handling this i dont have time to be jerked around on whether this game im putting my time into will ever be enjoyable again or not so i have better things to spend money on until they get their crap together
TheSilphRoad,removed,so niantic who specializes in gpsgoogle maps games cant get the core part of their game working so they just remove it they either have way too much spaghetti code or they have extremely incompetent leadership
TheSilphRoad,removed,removed footprints they cant really think their nontracking system is good enough can they
TheSilphRoad,removed,basic game functionality is broken with the tracking bug glad theyve been dicking around with implementing new icons i dont know if theyre just hiding an unsolved bug by getting rid of footsteps or have for some reason decided to permanently get rid of tracking but either way this sucks the fun part of everyday local play is tracking nearby unusual pokemon not wandering around hoping you walk into something
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this is real im quitting pokemon go the only reason i was still playing with this was that the steps might be fixed
TheSilphRoad,removed,its going to continue to happen because niantic fails to communicate to their player base its just sad
TheSilphRoad,removed,they why even have the nearby tab the radius is too large to find most of the pokemon in their time limit
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree played this the since the first day it came out it begun as picking a pokemon on the radar tracking it down precisely in ten minutes to walk to the spots you know got pokemon and hopetbh was way funner in the beginning pokevision out my ways sucks aswell
TheSilphRoad,removed,corrected it for you removed footprints of nearby pokemon we also support pokevision please go ahead and use it
TheSilphRoad,removed,im having a really hard time not getting salty with all the rain but this really bugs me it really seems like they are quickly moving the focus of the game away from catching pokemon the creator says pokevision detracts from the fun of the game but where is the fun supposed to be i can see the fun in tracking one with a hot cold method but how are we even supposed to play now is there any way ingame of tracking or are we now forced to just wander around with a minute clock ticking over our heads until we bump into it
TheSilphRoad,removed,hah no thanks screw this game pretty much the only feature in this game was searching for pokemon and thats been broken for two weeks now they fix it by removing the whole thing altogether what a useless dev
TheSilphRoad,removed,wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,im outraged because they havent told us whether this is temporary or permanent
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is no new mechanic at least not yet the footstep mechanic stopped working and they were unable to fix it so they removed even the hint it once existed logical says there is no footsteps so new players dont google what the steps mean and find the games broken do to the lack of communication its not hard to see why a lot are jumping to they removed it and are never adding it back
TheSilphRoad,removed,if the ability to track stays gone and they continue to come after mapping utilities im done playing the game was fun in the beginning and was fun with perfect information gained under duress but if youre going to tell me that their vision is for me to see a porygon or dragonite or whatever in nearby and be unable to find it short of blindly stumbling around and dumb luck nah aint got time for that the only fun in the game is the hunting and communal aspects and this kills the former right dead
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems like a drag
TheSilphRoad,removed,except with the step bug when a mon goes below steps it would disappear off the nearby
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao no way its surviving with those insane signup requirements dont kid yourself the only reason people are here is because theres a bunch of people who can plug things into spreadsheets for them to get imaginary points
TheSilphRoad,removed,not ironic but thesliphroads site kind of sucks no real time tracking and it shows spottingsnests by pokemon instead of by location
TheSilphRoad,removed,id get this in a heartbeat i hate having just a range of percentages and being required to power up the pokémon to find out what it is and silphroads takes quite a bit to do on mobile
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game has lost users literally every day day over day since the day of the step bug by the time they fix it or introduce something new there may be nobody left to care
TheSilphRoad,removed,ceo of niantic says pokevision is cheating okay cool fix your fscking radar then
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love a website that turns a game into a chore
TheSilphRoad,removed,u slap a muslim
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry but this isnt a theory its just you opining
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow theyve decided to turn their bug into a feature i am massively disappointed in this and it looks like ill be using pokevision for the foreseeable future
TheSilphRoad,removed,hopefully with steps removed all together people using party pokemon maps will stop justifying their cheating
TheSilphRoad,removed,here on the road we have cultivated an amazing culture of constructive and civil dialog whether or not a change is frustrating or puzzling we will continue to keep the road free of drama whining ragequit threads etc there are other subreddits travelers can use if they need to express their disagreements in those ways rhailcorporate steel beams
TheSilphRoad,removed,because your code is shit gilfoyle
TheSilphRoad,removed,they gave you a donut because they were hoping youd choke on it without any water
TheSilphRoad,removed,so when do we see an item appear in the shop to enable the threesteps again coins for hour of use perhaps
TheSilphRoad,removed,that would make things to easy the whole nearby pokemon is bullshit and broken not sure why niantic will not fix it but that is how it is
TheSilphRoad,removed,i heard something about it being removed for safety concerns if thats the case it could be the reason why it never worked it was refused after beta and before release by their legal team it didnt work after release on purpose and they took it out after the first update
TheSilphRoad,removed,welp there goes the fun for me pokemon go was supposed to be a game to get me out its not anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic policy if you cant fix it delete it
TheSilphRoad,removed,dev w a lot of experience in apps running at this scale millions of daily active users this is an interesting theory but i think its incorrect i would guess that they burned through an apidependency quota or maybe even straightup overloaded another service think google maps or something like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,omg d come on man
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol what they removed the foot prints feature completely
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like donuts yes but they gave you a donut
TheSilphRoad,removed,i play pokemon go but that doesnt prevent this fact from being undeniably not interesting
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know but my tracker is now showing every spawn to be long
TheSilphRoad,removed,this sucks when the halloween event started it rained for several hours when the thanksgiving event started it rained for two straight days now for the last three nest migrations it has rained the entire first day its freaking degrees here and its been raining for hours straight everythings frozen fm
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is certainly related to this migration my tracker is now showing all spawns being on the same hr timeline then all despawning at oncethis has never happened before
TheSilphRoad,removed,the month isnt even half over and its been a blast so far stay tuned for more double exp and stardust confirmed guise s
TheSilphRoad,removed,stfu and release the rest of gen
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre really gonna try to launch a hype trained based on the comment stay tuned for more
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont stay tuned just live your life normally and try to forget you read this it is possible more will not be much
TheSilphRoad,removed,checks for pubes
TheSilphRoad,removed,gen confirmed next week omfg
TheSilphRoad,removed,well glad they did this to at least shut up the whiners i remember trying to tell everyone that clearly that wasnt itbut you know delibird and gifts would be a sweet idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think its a legal thing less that they are against it more that they are against revelavent government agencies coming after them it was such a pain in the assassination to set my kids up for anything online that i just started lying about their ages to make them and make the headaches and hoops of fire go away
TheSilphRoad,removed,antiwhiner whining is this whole sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,this game ugh niantic it has not been a blast lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep thats poke go for the iphone it lets you walk around with that joystick and findscan for pokemon on the map
TheSilphRoad,removed,hm interesting never noticed that will check the local ratpidgey population all my dittos bar magikarp have been of the bird populus
TheSilphRoad,removed,usually people trying to be funny and not realising they are failing
TheSilphRoad,removed,bad font
TheSilphRoad,removed,did you try changing your font it might help
TheSilphRoad,removed,keep this rubbish for the pokemon go sub no one here cares
TheSilphRoad,removed,instinct
TheSilphRoad,removed,regardless of what you think the money you spend on the game doesnt mean crap you got what you paid for and you arent entitled to anything more this is incomparable to the hand held games most mechanics are completely different and until the rubysapphire remakes you couldnt catch all the previouslegendaries and mythics even in those games they arent all available im not saying make it a one city release but there shouldnt be a mewtwo on every street corner the point of them is to be rare that doesnt work if everyone just gets one
TheSilphRoad,removed,am i reading this wrong or are you saying you had to use bots to complete this
TheSilphRoad,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive already hatched elekids pichus igglybuff and baby clefairy
TheSilphRoad,removed,why cant i play both
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont forget to follow him on instagram
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we just take a moment to appreciate can we just take a moment posts its seriously inspiring and the joy and thankfulness truly brings me to climax so please can we just take a moment to thank everyone and everything that ever existed amen
TheSilphRoad,removed,because i would have died of types of cancer staying on rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit the importance of end game content by utehmephs xpost from footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats a long way to go and it does feel like theyre going to do it as slow as possible with the intent of drawing out the hype train and keeping people buying sht as long as possible with as little work required out of them
TheSilphRoad,removed,the good ole it will run out of soon enough good luck selling those niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,yea you go walk around in the of snow we just got hit with these people are salty im gonna play how i want to because i want to play to have fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is spot on the best post in a long time
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh come off it
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh the monthly lets take a moment to the silph road of who came from rpokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,if youre looking for niantic to fix this youre probably looking in the wrong place bring this up to niantic on their social media feed niantic probably actually reads what people say there
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah they just want you to buy more incubators
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,i didnt know if i could post it here but pokemongomapinfo is what ive been using heres my example of what the issue is is the gym in question shows it hasnt been touched so i went with my friend on base and tried getting in the gym some people said that its because its on base but if you go to any of the other gyms around they show recent updates like that one or any other one there very weird
TheSilphRoad,removed,guys i know u want to hatch the new babies lord knows why because most of them are just worse versions of mediocre pokemon but this game really isnt complex enough to be going to lengths like this if these type of thoughts are going through your head i promise there are better games to spend your time on i was as hooked on this shit as anyone but im telling you you will hit a brick wall and look back thinking wtf was i doing that wasnt even fun play at your normal pace the normal way you will hatch your eggs and get new ones potentially getting a togepi i promise seriously this game is stripped down enough as it is and youre going to run around for a weekweeks not catching pokemon or spinning pokestops just for a chance at new pokemon that are worse than what you are passing up catching
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope each team should get their representative birds
TheSilphRoad,removed,which rock are you living under i recently moved from my rock to a new one but i dont like it and am searching for a better rock
TheSilphRoad,removed,because you wasted this space on this board i hope you cant find the next rare that pops as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh yea and the hundreds of people ive met playing it down by the university dont have a clue what gym sniping is they dont care what it is and that are still just having fun playing the game doing what they want to and catching pokemon so i think ill pay more attention to the feelings of real people around me playing the game over people like you who have sone super rigid rule set
TheSilphRoad,removed,i live at sea level and those pokemon are most common for me i bet if i looked right now id see two of those four yep
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao i would do anything for that im walking chansey right now fucking ungrateful
TheSilphRoad,removed,i havent noticed an increase in tauros but earlier today i spotted a chansey via goradar and when i got there it was actually a tauros
TheSilphRoad,removed,god save us from niantic game designer save us all
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks like omastar can get mud shot now i hope someone datamines new move possibilities soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry this is wrong and fucken stupidly deplorable
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre so wrong and fucken stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game is fine the way it is you self entitled fuckface
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is isnt it
TheSilphRoad,removed,theses changes are so bizarre likewhy its almost as if they spot nerfed a bunch of pokemon that didnt even nerfing in the first place with a few subtle buffs dashed in on pokemon that literally dont matter
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont understand why theyre doing this the majority of changes make things worse and dont even hit any pokemon that could be considered too strong at the moment
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats sort of lame makes it even worse for rural players who probably dont have the pokemon with these moves
TheSilphRoad,removed,they nerfed the only good fighing mechanic who the hell is the game designer at niantic they really need to either make him work better make him stop smoking weed or find a new one
TheSilphRoad,removed,pr team guys people are complaining about spending endless hours farming magikarps only to be shafted with a charge move that is worse dps than his quick move and its not just happening to a few people it seems to be the majority what are you doing to do niantic remove dragon breath
TheSilphRoad,removed,which is bull i mean i feel for ppl who grinded the candy and got lucky with a good iv good moveset gyarados only for it to be nerfed but creating a legacy pokemon meta is horrible for the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,seaking looks like a retarded fish so he only knows retarded moves goldeen sounds like a retarded fish it is just by design o
TheSilphRoad,removed,gyms broken with eggs for over a week and other day bugs still plague this game lets drop an undocumented ninja nerf patch logic
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats incredibly frustrating im only a few candy away from a gyarados
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont think so niantic doesnt listen to feedback or make improvements to the game look on the internet
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been using iv calc and go radar go radar isnt consistent but it can be helpful
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a very strange patch almost none of the changes address any of the with the combat system and many of them actually make it worse making certain pokemon that are already weak and underused even weaker weezing i hope this is just a small step toward some larger change because these changes seem mostly random and pointless improving some pokemon like starmie and making others like gyarados having less effective diversity and they didnt even remove twister the charge move that horribly gimps him if he gets it
TheSilphRoad,removed,weezing losing its only stab quick move blows
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you seriously saying that you are driving while playing this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i saw a lapras at the slc library back when the pokefinder site was still working missed it by less than a minute pm july another was seen around this past week in temple square it likes the downtown that being said i have a ton of drowzee and a good number of jynx in the local area midvale and not one lapras seen this far south as far as i know
TheSilphRoad,removed,with numbers like that it is essentially the exact same as not having them hatch at all so for you if all regional exclusives could hatch from eggs with a in trillion chance you would be idiotically content because it can still happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,people still play this game unsubbed
TheSilphRoad,removed,so the rarest pokemon in the game muk that actually was a pretty decent pokemon as he should be given the rarity without being anywhere near overpowered is the one that received the biggest nerf nianticlogic
TheSilphRoad,removed,ಠಠ
TheSilphRoad,removed,crap
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,now if there is a rare pokemon within you dont know unless its next to a pokestop enjoy
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know what niantic fyou you shut down all party tracking sites and are making it as frustrating as possible for other apps that give you a location to functionand then you roll out this sorry excuse for a tracker i have never never seen a good pokemon at any of the stops nearest me which are almost a km away at the furthest point but now i cant see anything in my neighborhood where ive caught at least snorlaxes and countless other rare and starter pokemon fyou niantic seriously you wonder why these apps and party maps gained traction perfect example right here now youre forcing me and countless others to use other apps just to see whats around them
TheSilphRoad,removed,and its just as bad as i imagined
TheSilphRoad,removed,this makes me seriously question the intellect of the team assigned to developing the tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,so much for listening to feedback
TheSilphRoad,removed,upvoting everyone saying this theres a dratini spawn a few steps out my door that i will now no longer see this sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have spawn points within feet but all i can see is pidges and rat blocks away welcome to fail go
TheSilphRoad,removed,but what if psa evolved pokemon gave more candy when transferred so rural players wouldnt be screwed also the speed limit killed the game does anyone think this game should be easier so money is never required
TheSilphRoad,removed,its unbelievable stupid to roll our such a negatively received update like this though while they work out a better solution without exaggerating the game is literally unplayable for me now in my home area i would just have to wander aimlessly without even knowing whats nearby stuff like this alienates the casualhardcore crowd and is how you kill your mmo they hardly have goodwill saved up for their player base to just tank it for weeks while they work on their next server side update
TheSilphRoad,removed,caught over rattatapidgey caught since xp evebt was announced i havent caught a single ditto and they ened it hours early and didnt get a chance to do a mass evolve but they sure as hell made sure we got that tracker though right fuck this noise im done playing this game until the new year this is getting ridiculous
TheSilphRoad,removed,i caved and downloaded a map scanner about a week ago finally have a hitmonlee because i knew where it was not as fun as when i used to do circuits of town for squirtles etc but its just so cold out now i want to finish my dex some time before gen turns up
TheSilphRoad,removed,lucky you i finally got it and its awful
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly will anyone start a petition against this tracker ill definitely sign it its huge crap
TheSilphRoad,removed,utter garbage
TheSilphRoad,removed,we will continue to listen it goes on to say when ive not heard any credible quantity of support for it and a deluge of hate anger resentment and criticism theyre not listening
TheSilphRoad,removed,months of testing and they roll out this incredible
TheSilphRoad,removed,makes trackers needed again great
TheSilphRoad,removed,because sf is apparently the centre of the universe and nothing else matters
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh yeah it can always get worse
TheSilphRoad,removed,time for third party tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,ahh this means the decent pokemon that occasionally spawn behind my house ill never see
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been months and tracking has literally gotten worse with each update tell me why niantic doesnt deserve to lose all its goodwill for this
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep
TheSilphRoad,removed,bwah now i actually have to use the radar to see pokemon around my place since with the new tracker everything around me is blind spot except that lone pokestop half a mile from my house
TheSilphRoad,removed,welcome to the worst update to an app that i can think of same story can no longer see anything at my house when used to be able to see up to at a time
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have nothing positive to say about the tracker im livid i get a constant update on the same pidgeys and ratatas by the stop several blocks down instead of sightings niantics brilliant plan to reintroduce sightings later as the new tracking system
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow this is complete garbage i live in a subdivision with a ton of pokemon spawns i have no pokestops near me and guess what now i have pokemon on sightings the sightings list is there but nothing is on it and i know that is a complete lie if all we get is to track pokemon that are near pokestops when we happen to be around one and nothing else then im definitely done with this piece of trash game
TheSilphRoad,removed,after drastically neutering the tracker several times from its initial concept and the total outcry of disapproval i havent read a single good comment about it anywhere online why why does niantic then activate it worldwide
TheSilphRoad,removed,what the f there was an insane amount of push back against this its been long enough they could have done any of the small changes to fix it ie add sightings back in put sightings and nearby on separate tabs but they just blunder on ignoring all the negative feedback on their google plus pageredditeverywhere else the only thing i can think of is they didnt see much change in user behavior in the data because there was an event on
TheSilphRoad,removed,this thing sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,im going to get downvoted but lately most comment threads i read on this sub are self congratulatory or humblebrag vortexes
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic makes more money off the change as long as people still play pokemon go since its now impossible to track rare mon in my experience without a third party tracker there are two ways to play the game now you can either aimlessly wander around and hope to get lucky or you can camp somewhere with lures and incense most people will choose to camp a pokestop with lures and incense in a water biome niantic has made the sightings useless over time and its not a coincidence first they removed footsteps then grass and now this the harder it is to actually find rare pokemon in the wild the more likely you are to buy incense lures and incubators so clearly it is a change based on money alone
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah this thing sucks does niantic even think this is a good idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have been one of the most antitracking posters around in my history there should be a bunch of i hope they kill all trackers kind of posts guess whos been looking into how to use them now its the only way to see what is around me it feels horrible to be tempted by the dark side but you take away the ability to track pokemon in a game about tracking pokemon and suddenly i have no rational argument against it
TheSilphRoad,removed,fishermans wharf san francisco is god mode for this game rates and dense spawns all day compared to most places
TheSilphRoad,removed,why would you not want to collect a legendary who said its for battling or defending not a fan of this thread lets talk once they are actually released
TheSilphRoad,removed,my sightings are now empty for me as i live over a mile from nearest pokestop my neighborhood is very active roughly pokémon outside continuously sucks but i downloaded scanner app and check that for the rates that used to spawn here at a fair rate havent seen anything but commons since the migration double boo
TheSilphRoad,removed,i posted about this the other day i use a local twitter account to track spawns and i can be right on top of something big and it doesnt show up on the ingame tracking whatsoever its hard enough to find these things but now were literally wandering around blindly
TheSilphRoad,removed,no joke literally got it here earlier today and it showed me a lickitung a mile down the road but the magikarp machop and koffing in a ten foot radius around me were not i get some insane spawns right by my house sometimes and now ill have no clue ive had no joke a snorlax kabuto omanyte onix koffing grimer multiple electabuzz a dratini and now i can only see whats at the pokestop blocks away this is absolute garbage people complained about it when they had it isolated but instead of fixing the problem they just infected everyone with it like a toddler with a cold thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a rural player with no pokestops within miles of me its nice to know i can no longer see anything that point spawn thats houses down from me nope cant see it i love this new update wow whod have thunk it just turn off sightings all together to make the game that much more enjoyable level just turned off the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are not my real dad please dont s me what to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,add your grain to our industrialsized pile
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is listening to our screams and they want more
TheSilphRoad,removed,literally have an oddish right next to my character and the only thing showing up is a pidgey and rat that are blocks away come on niantic really
TheSilphRoad,removed,to fix it vote with your wallet ive spent around bucks a month this wont happen anymore i was happy with triangulating sightings crybabies ruined it for everyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,use a scanner
TheSilphRoad,removed,better solution niantic announce theyre gonna shut down the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,for part of the test the tracker was split with nearby pokémon and sightings pokémon so we know with absolute certainty that they can make a hybrid solution
TheSilphRoad,removed,my advice to just the title yea dont
TheSilphRoad,removed,this tracker ends it for me i have other things to do in life but it still makes me a bit sad because i had fun tracking down pokemon and had hoped for the fun to continue level from switzerland signing out
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are retarded
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah those suck meanwhile ill complain about how the game sucks without a real tracker where is my three steps
TheSilphRoad,removed,german player here and i cant find any positive thing about the tracker i have to say that i already have caught pokemon so there is not that much left to complete but this tracker is pure bs even if the spawntimes are increased to or minutes im sure that if there is sth good spawning at a spot in my city and i dont get to know the exact time when it started to spawn i wont make it to the spot so whats the point i get that city players are hyped and stuff but they should over think this decision in a favor for rural players this sucks big times first time im gonna quit for a period of time since i started playing day i had so much fun playing this game on a daily basis wow
TheSilphRoad,removed,load of rubbish im afraid rares being prioritised is simply not true and its insulting for you to say you know actual tracking actual tracking is not possible where i live now because i cant see any of the tens of pokemon anywhere near where i live
TheSilphRoad,removed,dear niantic please give the players what they want instead of wasting your success by not giving a darn about your game
TheSilphRoad,removed,ditch maps yea i never needed one but i might soon seeing as this new tracker ignores even the rare mon sitting right next to me and i have plenty of stops near me cant imagine the hell for rural its garbage they knew everyone hates it still brute force pressing it through so much for listening
TheSilphRoad,removed,bïtch fück yoütsr sucks fuckíng nuts anyway click bait hypocrites
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly perfect solution i dont know how my son and me are going to play this game now we are half a mile from the nearest stop which is probably a damn sight closer than some people who have nothing i dont want to see pidgeys at that stop when i have spawn stops literally on my doorstep and i cant see the machop and squirtle that have just spawned there its a joke and seriously if this is going to be how things are then im finished with this game its pointless waiting for a response from niantic to my message
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only low quality thing here is the app itself
TheSilphRoad,removed,only positive side of nearby so called tracker is that you dont need to leave your couch as you see only common mons spawning two blocks from you your second point is totaly wrong as spawns are random also nearby shows random pokestops luckily only two spawns that are not near pokestops are reachable from my couch if there would be sponsored pokestops and only pidgeys rattatas zubats spearows around that would be on nearby
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know i almost skipped on a blastoise during a stroll with my daughter a few days ago because of thick snow that was a long healthy laugh i hope you forgot a zero there
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is no ingame tracker in pokemongo the best tool to hunt pokemon is pokemesh pokealert pokehuntr etc i was hoping this shitty window of pidgeysrattata never come to my city but now that the functionality is global it is getting worse
TheSilphRoad,removed,your pretty certain your absolutelt wrong it doesnt pick the rarer pokemon its flipping rng again
TheSilphRoad,removed,this tracker does not allow for actual tracking this is incorrect
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have to admit for the last months i was certain niantic isnt stupid enough to release it i hoped they have it in sf to keep people quiet while they are either working on an actual tracker or to simply give them some hope that this system will be released i was certain niantic will trash it after some time sadly i was wrong
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should make it so you can toggle between the tracker and sighting
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should make it so you can toggle between the tracker and sighting
TheSilphRoad,removed,nosedrive right into a pool of crap the only part of the game which was fun is destroyed the game is now completely uninteresting and unchallengeing no more money from me its amazing how good they are at destroying their own game
TheSilphRoad,removed,simple close the app dont bother to open it again until major positive changes are made
TheSilphRoad,removed,the new tracker is not a tracker and it removes functionality from the game mainly seeing what is near you
TheSilphRoad,removed,you get downvoted for speaking the turth lol this has even less to do with the game than the posts it targets
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can do what im doing not playing the game as of yesterday i am protesting this change by not playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,because if you try to have any negative opinions on the game informative and constructive or not your post will be deleted here as it has been time and time again for people while the positive and silver lining ones remain if you cant talk about it here where they might see sent the info to the suggestion box
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is exactly what theyre doing and it makes me sick
TheSilphRoad,removed,even reasoned well written analysis that only examines the current state of the meta without any suggestions on how to fix arent welcome around here this sub is no longer respectable
TheSilphRoad,removed,i couldnt help but post this when i read niantic suggestion box it really feels that way sometimes people have been voicing new tracker concerns since it launched and it seems like they are rolling it out without polishing much this was the final nail in the coffin for me i will be giving the game another try once they push a new major content release hoping some things have improved by then i believe they will make it better in the meantime ive personally lost immediate interest in this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont post the links people love to complain without actually knowing where to direct their angst cue more appropriate channels people will no longer have the pasttime of whining which is no more than a fruitless expedition in this sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,because as a suburban players we went from a full sightings list to having one pokemon on the nearby that is over half a mile away
TheSilphRoad,removed,the title of a new discovery about pokestops and eggs is a bit too much couldnt agree more
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think there are two factors that come into play regarding spoofers fpm when fastpokemap released their code botting and spoofing programs gained new life they were able to play again they could play before in a very cludgy and clumsy manner that most players didnt want to deal with now they can play with sophisticated algorithms that minimize idle time if niantic were to update their security again of the bottersspoofers would get frustrated and would stop playing griefing many of these spoofersbotters are bored with the game theyre already super powerful they have the best pokémon and they claim daily coins by having their bots put their pokémon at the gyms atop mount kilimanjaro every morning before they wake up what to do grief other players of course the more pissed off we get the more we complain the more comments on fb and reddit threads the happier they get because they can show off their power the solutions a wait until niantic updates their security again most people will complain because their beloved trackers will go away but at least we wont have as many spoofersbotters b stop complaining yes its annoying yes it sucks however the more we complain the happier the spoofers get the best way to get a bully to stop beating you up is to let him know that he doesnt have the power to hurt you his main source of joy is now taken away
TheSilphRoad,removed,getting sad about peer review is probably something you should work on
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing that we didn´t and they didn´t know
TheSilphRoad,removed,except that restarting doesnt always work i have to restart times to get it going
TheSilphRoad,removed,this
TheSilphRoad,removed,magmar appeared in nearbypokestop near me walked steps to it this pokemon fled away then again it appeared same but gone fled away then again same times now lol wtduck is going on niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,between this and the change to the sightings radius i basically have no idea if the app is working and there just isnt anything close enough to load or if the app isnt working so why even bother opening it
TheSilphRoad,removed,the thing is this is a change that makes gameplay completely uninteresting to me since i got the new tracker theres been a grand total of one poke i would have been particularly interested in tracking down on it and it was a minute drive from me before there were decent odds id see a pokemon every hour or so that was worth walking to find im not interested in a driving game and im annoyed because ive given them money to play this game but now i have tokens that i have no interest in using
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are nothing more than a barium superior to world person if you actually flew only for that pokémon youre one of those that kill our world because of unneeded transports i dont envy you i detest you
TheSilphRoad,removed,most idea posts really can be read as i want all of the pokemon with perfect stats now please niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,only if the prestige tiers scale like the xp tiers do
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont quite understand what you are saying are you saying that you cant tell when the pokemon will despawn until it has only seconds left
TheSilphRoad,removed,posted from your solar powered phone made from recycled cardboard if not then think of the damage your doing just making this post the game is about walking while playing its also about travelling and seeing the world hence region locked pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,high lvl gyms are take too long to bring down okay now i have gyms make them hard to bring down we dont want gyms full of snorlax lapras and dragonite but make those pokemon easier to obtain so we can stack them in gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,im considering asking for a refund on google play and giving back my pogo plus game and device have been working worse and worse by the week if this was a standard product a fitbit or a phone consumers complaints would be heard from the other side of the world niantic should start picking up his slack outside of how good or bad the game is content balance and mechanicswise the app is awful do you imagine having to restart whatsapp or clash royale every minutes
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this is the way it always was before i know that something has changed in the way the data is sent
TheSilphRoad,removed,hit level days ago deleted the app the same day after the changes killed all the effort i put into building gyms finding people to form a whatsapp group and collecting dust to power up my pokemons
TheSilphRoad,removed,true downvote test
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually at hrs of grinding after work you can easily net exp per week four months in its obviously doable as ive done it i work a week and lead a dev team
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool ill walk across a few oceans to catch several pokemon that dont spawn in my country since trading still isnt a thing oh yeah and since this game is also about not cheating whilst having alternatives ie spoofing
TheSilphRoad,removed,httppokemapgoxyz works currently for android
TheSilphRoad,removed,with niantic who knows wtf theyre thinking nothing about them so far has shown any evidence of good knowledge of design or even coding conventions
TheSilphRoad,removed,what else to talk about what we all see is a dying game with so much potential cant we discuss our dreams here
TheSilphRoad,removed,easy to say after you racked up thousands of coins
TheSilphRoad,removed,my most sincere condolences for your niece cancer is an awful thing for her to have had to endure our year olds friend is in and out of the hospital every week for checkups and shes already been through a dozen surgeries how are her parents holding up having said that a random trip to japan during this period of time seems kind of selfish your family must need you however bad you feel multiply it tenfold thats how bad her parents feel right now its none of my business what you do with your life but you put it front and center for everyone to see
TheSilphRoad,removed,i caught a lapras by spoofing yesterday tho
TheSilphRoad,removed,but you arent paying solely for channel of youtube you are paying for all the entertainment knowledge and communication benefits you get from the internet likely something you would pay for regardless of the existence of youtube channel or not so yes it is free content and since youtube doesnt bitch at you for adblockers you dont even have to watch the ads
TheSilphRoad,removed,so many words so little content
TheSilphRoad,removed,happened to me and all my friends when your city only spawns mankey ekans and meowth you turn to spoofing then to sniping then to deleting the game i still logged in to collect the coins so total min per day now the gyms are all gone so havent logged in in over a week for the lulz went and got lapras yday but didnt even bother going to gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,should have tagged as
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokealert is great when youre on android
TheSilphRoad,removed,i claim of an incubator or if i already have then just leave it and take my xp from the battle
TheSilphRoad,removed,put in my top defenders and rush to the next gym just to find out that i can collect whole gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,that really sucks for you still go get your refund so now you are the arbiter of who can reply to what posts as well i am a casual reddit user i read the thread and respond i also respond to other posts as well not that you would notice rustled new one on me sick of your insulting negative and supercilious demeanor you are on the wrong sub this sub is not meant for this kind of thread go read the side bar
TheSilphRoad,removed,cuz at this pace next year the game will be ded
TheSilphRoad,removed,imagination
TheSilphRoad,removed,feel free to not listen to the radio or talk to a passenger either god forbid you sing along
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude niantic is dumb ass mother fuckers the secret is probably the pokemon catch bonus and they think no one knows
TheSilphRoad,removed,also we might start to think about doing things that seems extremely vague d
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh marketing so much talk with so little content we might start to think about doing things for the likes of germany the uk and north america who are going through their winter i mean cmon
TheSilphRoad,removed,by sometime next year most players will have deleted this game from their cell phones
TheSilphRoad,removed,well they do have to keep clicking im a passenger every seconds so that slows things down a bit
TheSilphRoad,removed,i used to see one every couple of days but lately nada candy i do have a wild dragonair but shes lower level that the two high iv dratinis ive hatched
TheSilphRoad,removed,look mummy a bully having a tantrum
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is this social justice warriors of silph road
TheSilphRoad,removed,i had snorlax spwans a day near my job blocks radius and noticed some kind of pattern but never actually kept track of it i hope i would have done it when fpm was alive
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is that you
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol at the children that have no idea how much work that would take duh op duh
TheSilphRoad,removed,trump will solve that problem by banning dindunoffins
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not for kids
TheSilphRoad,removed,so i herd u liek statisticz
TheSilphRoad,removed,just wait for blizzard to implement a wow like ar type game in the future i guarantee that they are paying attention to what was created obviously exercise plus gaming is a huge success and then tiein a nostalgic element to things if so byebye niantic you were a successful niche but the success in the scheme of things will be very short lived
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i havent gotten a single one yet because i spun before the event started and its not midnight here yet est also since the event will go until pst afternoon you will be able to spin just after midnight on the last day to get one additional incubator while those like me on est will not get that extra day it feels really nice knowing you got shafted out of two incubators because of miscommunicationtiming of the event thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i bet when you eat at restaurants you put get a job that doesnt rely on handouts from strangers on the tip line
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres a calculator for this since the equation is kind of mathy
TheSilphRoad,removed,heah church sucks big time better sleep in lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,thaaaaats the help i was looking for thanks buddy hope the rest of you guys enjoying bitching niantic out about why you didnt get enough from them for christmas xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,i collect coins from gyms daily but i also use another method which is actually pretty decent its using a rewards app called feature you download free apps and you get points for each then delete the apps afterwards if you want then you can redeem your points for it didnt take me very long to get enough for the cheapest available which is equivalent to pokecoins theyre always putting up new apps to download check every now and then and they really add up you get an extra points for using a code when you start also for android users theres a rewards app called google opinion rewards which has you answer some questions and they give you credit in the play store its slower than using this method but of course you can do both at the same time enjoy

TheSilphRoad,removed,i really dont know much about this scam thing and at the same time no one wants to be on the losing side but i just came across a good hacker who helped me hack my boyfriends text messages whatsap facebook instagram messages remotelyyou dont have to touch his phone while you have access to his conversations through the software he bought and install remotely on my phone i dont know how he did this but i think hes perfect at itcontact him at jonnycyberghostgmailcomtell him allinson referred you then you can thank me later god bless
TheSilphRoad,removed,so many things are wrong with this post magikarping is months old news bubblestrat is more effective prestige over gets reduced to in one combat regardless of how far over it is killing a lone karp is worth prestige and xp per kill its super fast to knock over a gym like this and actually really good xp
TheSilphRoad,removed,this game needs alot of uol updates it is very very rough around the edges with its core being very shallow still
TheSilphRoad,removed,i also have read either in rpokemongo or rthesilphroad where one of their teammates would use their extra account to kick out the lowest defender then train it back up and then put in their own pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,i completly agree with you itll be ok shhhhi dont agree with him however someone who can incorporate their temporary irrational frustrations into their moral compass this easily probably wont be persuaded by logic
TheSilphRoad,removed,on something i actually saw a dude uping gym with its vapordude is high on potions or something i didnt even want to touch his gym cause maybe hes a bit off
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know man this whole problem sounds like just a humblebrag for me it sounds like my life is so sad because my dick is so big that it dips in water when i sit in the toilet i wish i had access to enough low traffic gyms to have a few of them stagnate for a few days i certainly wouldnt be complaining but where i live any high level gym gets sniped by spoofers really quick
TheSilphRoad,removed,what does mean is that supposed to be or to also no one seriously has time to check on ivs any method that requires you to know the ivs must surely take advantage of the apprasial feature which tells you on the click of a button if the ivs are at a certain roughly and
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can spawn pokemon from one incense im going to call bullshit on that every single one that i have used has spawned max and those were all pidgiesratattas and if there really is that much of a spread on their effectiveness it is even less of an incentive to spend money on one
TheSilphRoad,removed,listen to you all the developer has brainwashed you lol the concept of fremium games is bullshit and you know it since the dawn of video games its been a flat fixed price for a game then some devs got greedy and invented fremium and dlc concepts so yeah pokemon go is a great game ive had alot of fun with but yeah no screw fremium games and this one is no exception
TheSilphRoad,removed,i understand why i was being downvoted what i dont agree with is downvoting my request for clarification instead of answering as many people did some people downvoted me because i said im not going to do a similar research on eggs because i think it would be pointless explaining very clearly why what the f
TheSilphRoad,removed,politically mexico i would say mexico is more north america than anything else mexico has treaties with everyone in america but canada usa and mexico have treaties on their own which makes them commerce partners in a different way to the rest of america as for australia i think the issue there is that their regional mon is only in australia the country not the whole continent islands around it so in this case they are different the continent and the region and culturally i would say it is pretty even given the proximity i may be biased about it since im from northern mexico in gaming it has always been pretty common to separate latin america because of the language barrier mostly because native english speakers cant understand spanish and get mad while native spanish speakers can understand both but thats a different topic that i may be biased because of my exp however the most important thing in gaming imo should be proximity to avoid lag in mexico you are fucked in between those two arguments you either go to the na server where some gaming communities force you to talk in english or you can go to the latin america server which may have half the population and ping lag in comparison
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope to god that this is a parody post if it is then i think its hilarious if not then youre insane
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh boy someone fixed that mess of a graphic nope they didnt it still has overlapping lines fix the overlapping lines before i do it this evening
TheSilphRoad,removed,remove the fluff add headings and formattingi couldnt really tell what you are asking for
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup then they obviously put a cp tauros in
TheSilphRoad,removed,the way eggs work is beyond terrible the fact that you cant delete the ones you dont want just shows how inept niantic is at freemium bad enough that you can pay for the progress but you cant even get past the duds
TheSilphRoad,removed,im here for silph road app or website its not really useful to me yet lol if youve checked anywhere for where you can catch certain pokemon the system behind how they spawn their moves and how they work andor how ivs work then the silph road app and website have been useful to you they were a key factor in developing and spreading that information other websites you use borrow from material they generated im here for the community lol you mean of people just complaining about rural players and submitting their ideas for how niantic should give them more stuff for free
TheSilphRoad,removed,and youre a cnt
TheSilphRoad,removed,depending on how well you know the area if not to well i suggest setting up base around the kohls store in meyerland seems to be close to the center of the zone that way you should be able to get to anyone of the snorlax spawns in time
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,did you report the person who put the pokemon in make sure you do that and hopefully they will get banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,and niantic will ban me then
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think the professor is simply molesting all the pokemon being transferred to him he always seemed a little creepy to me
TheSilphRoad,removed,some people who use this reddit think they are above and beyound
TheSilphRoad,removed,reported for backseat moderating
TheSilphRoad,removed,dafux it say
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is how many there are its not just a few
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think they
TheSilphRoad,removed,is this a joke lol and its until the no respect for niantic left
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeahteam play when they just catered to the crybaby casuals and totally screwed up the gym system so now any kid at least level can almost solo level gyms given enough items no coordination needed
TheSilphRoad,removed,japanese tracker map for people interested in seeing the lapras
TheSilphRoad,removed,how does japan still have a functioning tracker but the us doesnt
TheSilphRoad,removed,items is neat can you repeat it again tonight for the first big bonus so many items
TheSilphRoad,removed,items is neat can you repeat it again tonight for the first big bonus so many items
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is not remember the halloween event it really looks like that instead lapras being the new pidgey there look at the japanese maps lapras around every corner
TheSilphRoad,removed,its out there m not on google play but the apk floats
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongo is that way not that they will care
TheSilphRoad,removed,unfortunately theyve altered the reward structure so drastically the chief effect is to kill interest in the endgame which is not good low level casual players dont need gyms to keep them playing they have collecting to do jaded high level players who have reached and have completed their regional pokedex and who all they have to look forward to is gym battles making that a huge chore is driving them away people that ive been socializing with in pokemon go people ive enjoyed the game with since it came out theyre all hating this change and are losing interest that had been very strong up until now
TheSilphRoad,removed,sounds like we have to wait weeks for content
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol spoofing is great i got bored of the original game after a couple weeks so i figured id try spoofing to see what it was all about it actually made the game fun again for a while eventually realized there was no depth to the game so i quit spoofing too but damn it was fun while it lasted
TheSilphRoad,removed,and talking about iphones you can install gpsjoystick a spoofing app that has some kind of wasdbuttons just with a couple of clicks with cydia installer and your iphone doesnt even need a jailbreak for that
TheSilphRoad,removed,now we can get back to being outraged about the pokestop speed limit
TheSilphRoad,removed,bummer i was hoping to do another pokestop circuit tonight you wouldve thought that niantic would let it last to midnight in each timezone what idiots
TheSilphRoad,removed,already geez niantic why end it once i get out of work
TheSilphRoad,removed,fun detected fun has been nerfed
TheSilphRoad,removed,japan has a working tracker site i think its justified to use it in your situation
TheSilphRoad,removed,fuck her right in the pussy
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is so demotivating now especially without being able to spin while going over the new speed limit
TheSilphRoad,removed,because theyd rather run an event during the week when not as many people can play its nianticlogic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i made a simple stylish script to remove all the crap around the edge too install httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailstylishfjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffeutmsourcechromeapplauncherinfodialog plugin and create a new style for the domain pokevisioncom with the following header homesidebar display none homemap height important width important homeisenus padding homemapscan overflowy hidden important weirdly it makes the hover info for pokemon off placed slightly but its better than it was p
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres people who play games to have fun and then theres people who play games to mind numbingly grind the shitbout of them just like in the original pokemon games you can play the games catch the legendaries and beat the elite four or you can invest a stupid amount of time to iv train pokemon and find shinies
TheSilphRoad,removed,here dratini is easier
TheSilphRoad,removed,the one i used was or something idk im not an administrator or anything i dont ha e codes to give out lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,you may aswell ask is there a way to play pokemon go without internet because the answer is the same
TheSilphRoad,removed,the fact that you in all seriousness had to ask this question speaks to how ridiculous dictatorlike and authoritarian niantic has gotten just shows how disconnected they are from the people
TheSilphRoad,removed,that speed nerf is absolutely stupid it suggests you can hatch your pokemon by running even at a moderately slow pace its possible to get over in is not difficult a fast pace for that and people who are actually interested in running and would try to hatch eggs while doing it will get closer to for that pushes it up to some
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah nigga that dont work
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah thats the only thing i can come up with and im a pretty smart dude
TheSilphRoad,removed,womp
TheSilphRoad,removed,so youve got all the regional exclusives and mewtwo and mew nice
TheSilphRoad,removed,ya know when they said that walking with your buddy would give other rewards along with candy i was like ooh a surprise typical niantic vague answers are just vague lies walking your budy just gives you candy except pikachu shoulder sit at which isnt even a reward really as it has no affect on gameplay
TheSilphRoad,removed,unpopular opinion the us should never switch to the metric system ever and learning it is useless if you arent an engineer
TheSilphRoad,removed,can you imagine how strong the us could have been if it only implemented the metric system earlier
TheSilphRoad,removed,you just killed my hype i dont need to play anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats he gonna do sit on your face
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok i really need to ask one thing how is there no outrage about these way i see it it doesnt offer much you can attempt to capture pokemon with standard pokeballs which wont work for the most valuable pokemon anyway and you dont get to see what youre catching so you should get your phone out to see anyway you get to tag pokestops if i understand this correctly and ok this is fine but hardly worth the price and it allows you to hatch eggs walk buddies with a locked phone which is the only really valuable feature that could be available in the base app without too much trouble if they didnt limit it just to sell these horrendously overpriced gadgets am i the only one that feels that way im not trying to be the hater here id just really appreciate an explanation why this is considered okay for all the enjoyment i get from the game i just dont see it
TheSilphRoad,removed,does no xp and stardust kind of kills the use
TheSilphRoad,removed,misread as pedo meter
TheSilphRoad,removed,cheap junk wheres our real life pokédexs
TheSilphRoad,removed,since he just talked out of his a when asked about predetermined movesets during the previous talk i dont pay much attention to what he says
TheSilphRoad,removed,my guess is he will show up on halloween he can look like other pokemon just like we can dress up as whatever we want fits i reckon probably during the proper trickortreat hours or so
TheSilphRoad,removed,have a big penis
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have of which i caught yesterday are they rare im in nyc
TheSilphRoad,removed,remember john also promised breeding and we all know that ditto is essential for breaeing so may be ditto will be introduced when breeding come out
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is a false belief that curveballs and greatexcellent throws affect capture rate the only thing that has any notable influence on capture rate is the size of the shrinking circle when it hits
TheSilphRoad,removed,can you keep your derpy politics out of my video game subreddit tyvm
TheSilphRoad,removed,ditto will be extremely handy once pokémon reproduction is implemented if it ever is implemented god i wish nintendo could just rip this project out of niantics hands already and right the ship maybe theyll do an nyc and sf only event for the legendaries and thatll be the final straw
TheSilphRoad,removed,its all that antiroot drm running lets take care of a few hackers by not letting rulefollowing rooted players play and unrooted players deal with worse performance whos idea was this anyway
TheSilphRoad,removed,they changed the appraisal text size and stylingi hate it it has this weird affect where its almost like the text is being typed it goes from to much harder to get the important bits out of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,not sure about battery life but stuff is a lot slower to load especially models map lags as well definitely feels worse overall
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive given up on silphroad nest map ive tried like nests and none of them worked
TheSilphRoad,removed,its almost as if there were some way to minimize the game and have it still running players woudlnt missclick and lose hoursweeks of timemoney sorry im butthurt over being forced into buying a peripheral to arbitrarily unlock basic functionality
TheSilphRoad,removed,the xp bar is so big and toxic yellow is hurts my eyes
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres one that came out like months ago called pokemon go but its tracker sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,collusion with phone industry i really have wondered about this
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongoivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,fix the damn tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually the ban system is very bad i am on a facebook group of pokemon go in my city and there are a lot of people talking about how they cheated and the ban only stay for like one day then their account is working again
TheSilphRoad,removed,so its like half botting for just bucks crazy
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the same guy who thought pokevision made the game less fun so we are dealing with someone who considers wandering aimlessly catching only pidgeys and rats fun it may not be an actually fun thing just something hankie thinks would be fun to have us do
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow niantic is really taking the meme of pgo getting worse with every update too seriously i mean come on my nexus had enough battery issues even before pgo
TheSilphRoad,removed,like i said entirely possibly a coincidence and if it was actually true someone else would have noticed it by now the fact that i saw four in one day is probably random like you said however if i see four tomorrow then youre full of shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,so they actually fixed something i have not noticed any fixes yet only new bugs
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is quite a lot of effort but if you get one of the python pokemon go maps running theres an option to show all spawn points
TheSilphRoad,removed,the more i read about this device the more i think about what a huge waste of money it is to whoever bought this device rip
TheSilphRoad,removed,the catch mechanism is terrible but the egg buddy is good i can see why it would be worth it for you since you could be racking up km and hatching eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe if we lobby niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really hope my local pikachu nest turns into something more useful
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah niantic can go fck themselves for putting the distance tracker behind a plastic paywall scumbags thank you for this tip
TheSilphRoad,removed,what tracker is this
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol looks like youve already been download to oblivion
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant play on i will not why would they force to update if its unplayable nianticd
TheSilphRoad,removed,ugh like most of us here i was holding out on updating because is a mess
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is a terrible company
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh great back to clearing chache and re logging in every time i play if you are going to make people update at least make that version work
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you are having problems with this update please voice your concerns by leaving star reviews on google play pointing out whats wrong this just might make them do a hotfix sooner rather than later
TheSilphRoad,removed,im seriously laughing at all the people who refuse to gym battle on the current version sweet more coins more time saved for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,the third party trackers are using the old server with and niantic sends them lots of caputchas but the trackers have gotten past that by subbing in another bot to replace the caputchaed bot forcing all bots to will get them off the old server and maybe slow them down for a day is my guess i think this is all about third party tracker bots but who knows
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsimgurcomartmxwo first ultraball and yeah as others mentioned i knew beforehand that it was from my tracker im running a community map for my city at httppokekartede i was just really surprised that it was level didnt expect that
TheSilphRoad,removed,silph executive made a post saying its fixed int he next update
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy drama do what you want stop wasting your time on what other people think let alone polling the community for how you can try to force unwanted interaction about a game on them
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont recall saying i wasnt its probably going to come down to getting banned and walking away from the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpspkgetcom
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is like the first time i have ever seen this
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats what she said d
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey reversal non pokemon related question are you a football fan and if you are what is your favorite english team im a united fan ggmu
TheSilphRoad,removed,if the theory is disproven it might only work with incubated eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,yyc
TheSilphRoad,removed,for science is rule leaking again
TheSilphRoad,removed,its pretty nice months but niantic has a little ways to go before i start giving congratulations and anniversary praises we will see in the year anniversary if i will give congrats
TheSilphRoad,removed,we just had an event a week or two ago that did this very thing did ya miss it bro also rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,is it how niantic keeps the number of active players high
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats ridiculous there needs to be a permanent consequence or its completely pointless why ban him and then let him off the hook to keep his stuff completely defeats the purpose this pretty much took away the only hope i had of getting the cheaters in my city banned eventually
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont think any of the kids that post these gimme free crap posts realize that niantic will never do it because of cheaters
TheSilphRoad,removed,is not important if you have fun is importaint if you pay money in shop dont be naive man please and dont forgot downvote me for truth
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok but dont come back once new features are implemented ok
TheSilphRoad,removed,just the tip
TheSilphRoad,removed,only fools would skip the hatch screen might as well not buy incubators if you guys hate getting new and rare pokemons you might need and seeing what they are
TheSilphRoad,removed,one time a kangeskhan was spotted in guelph ontario someone tried to catch it but it ran
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic could have done a lot of things better the hype was fairly predictable they should have started off with better servers and a stable tracker they should have and should communicate more it seems that theyre trying to drown the game when a simple twitter post about or whatever could build a hype and bring players back
TheSilphRoad,removed,we fixed themby alienating a good portion of our player base
TheSilphRoad,removed,what siteapp was used to get this information
TheSilphRoad,removed,haha thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah we got it you cheat because youre lazy and broke
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can download plenty of nonlocationbased games to your phone including actual educational games for kids theyll probably be more rewarding for the kids too since theyre actually designed to be played while sitting around
TheSilphRoad,removed,almost daily i want to post a thread complaining about how shinies arent in the game yet its so simple and itd be so dope
TheSilphRoad,removed,what tracker is that
TheSilphRoad,removed,a new developer
TheSilphRoad,removed,i second his point though
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes but i dont think a single feature would add much excitement
TheSilphRoad,removed,its sad that we are starving so badly for an update that the addition of sprites on the internet causes such a stir in emotion niantic is squandering such a great opportunity to consistently make steady income
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should focus on fixing the device they already made
TheSilphRoad,removed,the device to make pokemon go safer to play is only going to be available in other countries as every american already has five its called a gun
TheSilphRoad,removed,i only log in now to collect coins land daily bonuses then log out that takes about a minute altogether currently holding gyms i havent had to go around finding high level gyms since the ones i got are pretty stable so it is a consistent flow of dust and coins daily plus the bonus and thats all i do really its pretty much a min day pogo for me btw yes im a spoofer so yes it really does take only min a day to do all these ive been spoofed in this local park for days now niantic must be wondering if im a homeless sleeping at a park
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe squirtle all over her jigglypuffs might have to start with a little lickitung if shes feeling drowzee i promise she wont be krabby after
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for including a feature that should have been there at release
TheSilphRoad,removed,these can we just take a minute to thank niantic threads are just karma grabs its phrased the exact same way every time too go take a minute and thank niantic somewhere they might actually read it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i definitely could care less about karma could care less could well im done here
TheSilphRoad,removed,the things you suggest are the same are actually advertised sales that we know are going to happen on black friday this kind of stuff is just speculation about what might happen and it gets old after a while
TheSilphRoad,removed,my tip keep your money
TheSilphRoad,removed,more gen confirmation here
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think its to reduce the size of the app if niantic wanted to reduce their app size they could just dump all the garbage code that httpstrongcodes adds to it that said it probably doesnt actually make the app that much larger
TheSilphRoad,removed,more loading screen more data usage its funny how it comes out the same day us cell company announcement partnership with niantic its almost if more data usage benefits them somehow
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just cant wait to see the animation of nidoking breeding with a mankey that will be one sexy clip i feel like mankey will be a power bottom
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope i did run a tracker before they were all killed off though
TheSilphRoad,removed,leave this kind of post for rpokemongo this is not informational whatsoever lets try to keep the road positive and helpful
TheSilphRoad,removed,terminating lol try battling some gyms it will terminate itself this update is garbage all these bugs crashes vibration bug model loading for some mass transfer move images in gym and purple bars shouldnt have updated oh well they will probably force the update in a couple days anyways what a mess
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes all valud cpncerns this update is garbage crashes from gym interaction hideous chargebar colir vibration bug model loading on startup every time smalker exit button srsly is there anything good about this update no i dont use mass transfers i transfer pokemon as ii catch them one by one after appraisal check wish i could roll back to old version it even crashed when i selected pokemon to catch earlier today obviously it despawned after minute it took app to reload
TheSilphRoad,removed,i guess they wanted the client to be ready for gen without any more updates the thing is once downloaded all those resources could be stored in the phone even give the user the option to clear the app cache manually if heshe so chooses whats more they could put in place a system for forcing updates on outdated resources or whatever anyway i think of it i cant understand this decision it amazes me to no end how freaking garbage the game is as a piece of software that being said i still play it and am excited about gen which kinda furthers my amazement hahaha
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant wait for gen so my game can slow down devour battery and crash even more
TheSilphRoad,removed,its sad to see a cynical and insulting comment like this cynical means to assume bad motives you do i dont insulting means to use language that is pejorative and demeaning you do i dont im saying nothing to or about op just laughing at myself and taking an idea to an absurd extreme which others have enjoyed joining in with presumably thats why they upvoted it cant think why anyone upvoted yours but its their right to do so if they read something they agreed with i grew up some time back
TheSilphRoad,removed,no screen shot bs stop making posts with no proof
TheSilphRoad,removed,greetings from the us im not sure where to post this so ive decided to start here i live in texas and must live near a tauros nest ive caught dozens the highest level was a id like to help anyone add one to their collection as i enjoy the game so much again im not certain how to properly go about this so forgive me if im doing this incorrectly please if anyone would like for me to catch a tauros for them free of charge of course you may email me your information at and ill do my best to catch the highest level tauros for you i sincerely want to help
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi shut up yours faithfully tiom
TheSilphRoad,removed,we already had a discussion on ideas and i agree there should be less of them thats what they are ideas nothing more
TheSilphRoad,removed,look at the guys smarmy response all they had to say was i should point out this post actually breaks a rule not copy paste my response and edit it to take the piss also the response is breaking of the rule you stated
TheSilphRoad,removed,please not this again
TheSilphRoad,removed,tsr is the new rpokemongo confirmed
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is not the place to put ideas we frown upon the idea threads on this board this will be reported for spam just fyi you should be messaging niantic on twitter facebook or shooting them an email niantic isnt here they dont care about reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,the amount of contradiction in this post is amazing can i report you for unconstructive whining rant cynicism probably not because you tell people to go somewhere to get their suggestions heard only constructive whining here on tsr
TheSilphRoad,removed,i get things we always be new to some people but that way we will have the same discussion over and over ad nauseam always the same ideas always the same comments i hope this wont be the new standard of this sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,has anyone ever tried searchingi heard its awesome but i think its overrated
TheSilphRoad,removed,data usage hasnt changed but i find pogo to redownload all pokemon models everytime i restart my phone if you dont download the models you may find yourself wasting data that could be the problem what i found was the app draining even more my batterysince like three or four patches ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,sadly expanded to israel now i see pidgey away while i have spawn points in my neighborhood i do have pokestops around my neighborhood but that is far from being actually useful in covering the area
TheSilphRoad,removed,brazil here confirming rip
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i get now why people were so frustrated with this feature ive just opened my app and now sightings are gone and now i can see a zubat that is like away from me niantic need to update so we can choose between the two of them
TheSilphRoad,removed,confirmed in colombia
TheSilphRoad,removed,its such a waste that there are duplicates within the there they can easily just show one of each specie if there are more than show the closest instance
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here utterly useless and it tracks stops beyond line of sight away
TheSilphRoad,removed,is it so hard to implement a switch or scroll bar
TheSilphRoad,removed,learn to read
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes how hard is it to understand we want tabs to switch please niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is still useless pidgeys crowd my nearby while im sitting on a hitmonlee
TheSilphRoad,removed,get acouple rhydons mine eat snorlaxes for breakfast then shits them out and eats them again for dinner
TheSilphRoad,removed,let me get my violin 🎻
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,removed,shitposts belong in rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,drop them a tweet why are you telling us
TheSilphRoad,removed,this which makes it total garbage still
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont i see zero evidence of listening to the community except on minor trivial things the big things that matter are screwed up so bad stop being a sheeple
TheSilphRoad,removed,relax you grumpy shts the guy just wish them a happy xmas thats all you people need to chil jesus
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is ridiculous
TheSilphRoad,removed,annoying
TheSilphRoad,removed,so how did my male pikachu evolve into a female raichu
TheSilphRoad,removed,but why cant pikachu be trans wouldnt that be more progressive for the pokemon go community at large to be able to accept pikachu for their new self regardless of what other pokemon think s
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you know what a straw man is
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpspokeassistantcommainivcalculatorlocaleen after receiving the iv results you can alter the pokemons lvl on the horizontal scroll bar below the results
TheSilphRoad,removed,triggered
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think its much more likely that they switched it to stay faithful to the default gen designs than them worrying that its a male pikachu becoming a female raichu since there arent genders ingame at this point its not actually a male evolving into female
TheSilphRoad,removed,did you just assume raichus gender
TheSilphRoad,removed,when a pokemon evolves they dont change gender wellllll there
TheSilphRoad,removed,made me laugh
TheSilphRoad,removed,entitled
TheSilphRoad,removed,grouchy much
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive had eggs go from to randomly but maybe it does let you find candy at times
TheSilphRoad,removed,and here i am still waiting for the update
TheSilphRoad,removed,go to sleep
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool nbsp pokedex bonus resets to the bottom at means that if were isolating for only the evo activity by isolating the effects of evos excluding the lucky egg bonus we should also apply the principle to all bonuses related to the new pokedex registrations so the floor vs in my model nbsp both xp from evolutions the numerator and total xp the denominator will change given that were isolating for the evolutions we must also lower total xp when calculating percentages because total xp in my model includes xp from le sessions in the scenario you described total xp drops to so call it or nbsp per your point that id only be one level lower without using lucky eggs thats true however this is illusory given the exponential xp curve with leveling below the leveling gains from doublexp are significant since the point thresholds are relatively low my biggest single sitting evo session yielded leveling me up two levels in minutes the remainder of all of and into above though you get rapidly diminishing returns due to the everincreasing point requirements per level leading to your next question nbsp generally speaking no now that im over lucky eggs have significantly lower utility and i dont focus on them i was always planning upon hitting to switch strategies from xp grinding to building a stronger team catching new dudes and accruing stardust and thats what ive done for the most part my rationale was because of the two obvious factors poke catch and hatch cps are equivalent over so its not terribly valuable to levelup considering this factor and the exponential xp curve significantly discounts the relative xp impact of the fixedbonus lucky egg the only caveat to this is the cp ceilings of my best pokes per level but to this point id counter that any levelingup is of almost no benefit unless you accrue stardust at the same rate meaning you need to shift to catching and battling over grabbing xp and you almost want your xp gains to grow at rate thats closer to your stardust gain rate or else you have theoretical cp in you pokes but no ability to powerup with all that said i still use lucky eggs occasionally but the urgency is no longer there i actually far prefer regular gameplay under the eggs to evo sessions under the eggs at this point
TheSilphRoad,removed,id be careful about that since the update specifically warns people away from getting updates anywhere but the legit sources with ingress niantic banned people who were using apks for updates or so ive heard so theres some risk getting your updates early this way
TheSilphRoad,removed,how dare you assume its gender shitlord triggered
TheSilphRoad,removed,catalonia spain europe nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,how to assume hisher gender
TheSilphRoad,removed,obtained illegitimately im not envious of anything i just like seeing all the butthurt losers who cry when they get banned for not playing by the rules
TheSilphRoad,removed,you all sure are am entitled bunch of cocksmokers
TheSilphRoad,removed,i thought in the core games this was for any pokemon with the flame body ability which also would include from gen ponyta rapidash moltres not available yet with this being the case it should also work with ponyta or rapidash as your buddy correct me if im wrong httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikiflamebodyability
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh wow i didnt know catalonia was its own country its on the same continent as neverland right
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks friend but i understand how to google the problem is i live in asia but as my flair says i live in an american territory so it gets a little weird ive had the game since literally day onebut havent seen heads or tails of farfethched since day of release i was curious if anyone was tracking the regional ones by country within the regions because it looks like thailand and the philippines are having similiar issues with farfetched
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive had a hitmonlee from a egg caught one in my city zoo and another one in a lure ive seen a hitmonchan in nearby and fastpokemap near me but i was busy couldnt leave to catch it
TheSilphRoad,removed,what would they do make it so you can power up shot tier pokemon like this but it has no impact on dragonite because people would just do this for their dragonite too and it would still be the best and having to buddy with a combat pokemon is annoying because you cant battle or defend gyms while they are your buddy
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic has forecast ability and i bet the update got pulled back was rejected
TheSilphRoad,removed,leave please
TheSilphRoad,removed,i named my magmar asshat fireduck for obvious reasons
TheSilphRoad,removed,so if you were using this option up until this update to play that would mean that you were using gps spoofing to play in say nyc hmm
TheSilphRoad,removed,every part of the globe that has android suck it ios
TheSilphRoad,removed,cheaters lol if you consider someone like myself having spent none stop during days straight running around catching dratinis in a park evolving them up to a cheater then yea report me otherwise this game has been long enough in the market for people to have gotten n dragonites n lapras n snorlax considering their luck with hatches spawns
TheSilphRoad,removed,then thats your own fault you have the ability to download it just apparently not the capability
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can place a weak pokemon as last defender so others can win and increase the gym prestige more like please dont be that player that puts cp slowbroexegcutorsnorlax they are fcking hard to take down to train the gym i usually just look for another gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,i heard an early report that downloading and installing the app causes puppies be killed omg can anyone confirm this is false please
TheSilphRoad,removed,at this rate will people still be playing by the time the web app comes out
TheSilphRoad,removed,when did this sub turn into every other thread being full of confirmation bias and false untested info
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have no information pertaining to this question
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can confirm in my area there is a voltorb and magnemite nest at a port with large cranes and cargo crates everywhere i found out from pokevision been tempted to sneak in there but havent had the guts yet lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,most of the major cities already have their own tracker sites i think though like the major city near me if i go in i can go to a website that functions like pokevision but it only works in range of the city so yeah i dont think it would change much other then rendering tracker sites obsolete also a lot more then just major city areas have some pokestop clusters the center of my suburban town where the most spawns are has a bunch of stops so it would work there the park i visit a lot has pokestops etc it wouldnt do shit near my house but it would at least help a lot of suburbansemirural players in driving distance of stops somewhat
TheSilphRoad,removed,this sub is degrading before my very eyes everything is a psa of incorrect or outdated information or a theory which is likely to be false
TheSilphRoad,removed,geez dude are you okay
TheSilphRoad,removed,well then hopefully an outside company can come up with more effective pokemon tracking technology
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah im getting the tracker showing me pidgeys almost a km away from me pretty useless imo
TheSilphRoad,removed,smal hint niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,there may actually be a magikarp to begin with on my scanner it will only stats that belong to the disguise pokemon for example if its disguised as a pidgey my scanner shows pidgey tackle air cutter as for if the disguise has the same iv as the ditto yes it does
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are correct political correctness destroys all
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really hope that isnt why theyre messing up the tracker so much that would be a ridiculously terrible decision although im not sure what good decision could lead to this tracker situation
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry internet stranger but i hate you i have caught so much garbage today still zero ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive not given much thought to the leadership of that company but you mentioning the higherups turned on a lightbulb they ought to hire someone that enjoys playing the game and let that guy dictate the direction of development its obvious the higherups dont know how to nor have the desire to play pogo
TheSilphRoad,removed,when i said obvious fix i meant given the path niantic is on not if we were ignoring the status quo and recent changes
TheSilphRoad,removed,this
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow stops block the entire view cool
TheSilphRoad,removed,or maybe its an easter egg mew confirmed s
TheSilphRoad,removed,this release was terrible i expected at least a small easter egg with him not just go and catch every shitty pokemon and you will get ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,not where i live
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait what did they do patched a client that gives a spawn a chance to be something else
TheSilphRoad,removed,try loading up ingress
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre so dumb im not going to waste energy explaining how stupid you are i just want to let you know youre an idiot
TheSilphRoad,removed,how does releasing ditto show they are maturing as a game company if they release legendaries because of a bizarre challenge then they fulfilled their duties as well how much money have they made so far and how hard is it to input a pokemon onto a game if they wanted credit they should do a stupid dragonite event for everyone so everyone in the rural areas would stop complaining make rares like snorlax lapras dragonite chansey porygon all spawn like pidgeys and rats then maybe there would be a balance in this game still confused what polished content you see since everyone is complaining about the tracking system every patch stupid event perks and streaks are one of the few things left for this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,flawless implementation it was the weakest most under creative way to introduce ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you dumb or are you dumb how is the release of ditto done well at all its insanely easy to attain and there is no thrill or chase involved due to how accessible it is to every single player out there
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am focusing on one company a game i used to enjoy and how incompetent this company is when it comes to game design and communication although i must say communication is slowly improving
TheSilphRoad,removed,how is there actually more negative karma in root comments under this thread than positive karma is there really no room for discussion on this sub i know the mods like to keep this a rantfreezone but the countless open letters to niantic brimming with praise and rainbows is a lot more annoying than a good rant
TheSilphRoad,removed,take of this thread and go to pokemongo whine elsewhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you kidding me they just randomly leave out a pokemon then randomly put it in the game with no event mention announcement anything and youre happy they are lazy as poopie and released an unfinished game remember how people were thinking it was some mystery going to be an event a game to found him or figure it out nope they just wanted to rush out the game and now ditto is randomly in the game how fun man what a great company
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really dont like this new tracker system they managed to make something worse than before and i didnt know that was possible
TheSilphRoad,removed,the implementation wouldve taken like literaly seconds no hard work has occured
TheSilphRoad,removed,tears
TheSilphRoad,removed,increased jynx spawns
TheSilphRoad,removed,how big is his tip compared to others
TheSilphRoad,removed,envorimental hero
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpspokemonappxhk if you dont catch one and run out of time use this url youll find farfetchd in c rank pokemon as c級精靈 label
TheSilphRoad,removed,go to pokemonappxhk for locations of different pokmons surewin for android does the trick too

TheSilphRoad,removed,try this website next time httpspokemonappxhk
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope you fail to catch it because you had to make a post about it wishing you bad luck
TheSilphRoad,removed,keep in mind hk has multiple working trackers if things get desperate you can always take a taxi very cheap over here and can cover a lot of distance in
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe when evolving lombret into ludicolo it will get deported back to mexico that way it can be exclusive d
TheSilphRoad,removed,then why the determination to bitch for minutes about the way the game is played if it was just a random download wouldnt it have made more sense to say oh and uninstall i would think some other motivation would be required and all my friends are playing i want to play too seems as likely as anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,i literally just left work and i commute on foot i fucking need this now
TheSilphRoad,removed,playing in la right now got it through updating beta app holy fuck the hype has never been realer
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are none because youre an impatient idiot
TheSilphRoad,removed,for any android users that the app hasnt released for yet youre welcome to get it here remember in order to install you must enabled unknown sources under security
TheSilphRoad,removed,il just leave this here it works here in indiana
TheSilphRoad,removed,me too west texas here fuck i hope this isnt a ban or that they reset me i have three eggs and i just hit level
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant get on at the moment so i cant check have you caught other pikachus if not then the whole of your journal pain in the ass to screenshot all of it though should prove it
TheSilphRoad,removed,is there a sub that isnt puffed up with self importance i come here for the better info then whats on pokemon go but im not writing a formal essay everytime i need to post this is a shitty mobile game not science
TheSilphRoad,removed,the logic being that this would stop a random level player from just dropping in their cp pinsier this is exceptionally selfish unhelpful behaviour go find a sharp stick and httpimgurcomgalleryqdyjpdbgif
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic should fix their broken game to begin with otherwise more cheaters will continue to do what they to have the advantage
TheSilphRoad,removed,maaaaybe per unit maybe
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this is definitely annoying counterpoint the game and this sub have slowed down to a crawl and discouraging these posts would turn this place into an empty wasteland
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah fuck whats the psychic quick attack confusion
TheSilphRoad,removed,unfortunately the model just doesnt work as a reddit community with all this attention im unsubscribing for now
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah but problem is some readers dont take the has anyone else experienced threads as part of the observation process and rather interpret such posts in which you often see people confirming or declaring they think its interesting as a theory being confirmed by multiple people which leads to misinformation on a side note did you really downvote me downvoting when someone doesnt agree with you doesnt contribute anything to the discussion i would like not to expect such attitudes in this sub but considering what op is describing
TheSilphRoad,removed,nintendo went pretty cheap on making pkgo im sure the profit they made from it is at least they could have put an led screen and display what type of pokemon is near by and let you know in writing if it fled or you catch it they could have even tell you what you got when you spin a pokestop instead they plop a stupid led button light to save a couple pennies
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill vibratey your bits
TheSilphRoad,removed,badges dont do anything so who cares
TheSilphRoad,removed,game is boring sadly theres just nothing to do i went back to the game boy games
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hack and i got tauros mr mime and farfetched i live in australia but i havnt got kangaskhan yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,ivs explained each type of pokemon has a base set of attributes for stamina attack and defence each specific pokemon is born with its own iv individual values that further increase these stats by extra points you can not change the ivs not all pokemon are born equal these ivs make small differences in the final power of a pokemon for example the base attributes of a charizard are this would be the worst charizard available where all ivs are zero with max ivs a charizard would have each of these atk def and stam values for charizard are only better nonetheless if having the absolute best pokemon is critical to you this tool wll help you find the hidden iv values that your pokemon has so you can decide to keep it or try for something better absolute perfection isnt just having the best ivs the perfect pokemon would have both maximum ivs and the best moveset possible note that your pokemons maximum level is governed by your trainer level to level yourself up faster and therefore gain access to leveling up your pokemon further check out xp batching this tool uses the two following formulas and the inputs you provide about your pokemon to attempt to identify its ivs hp base stam stam iv lvlcpscalar cp base atk atk iv base def def base stam stam note that pokemon have hidden levels and each level requires two powerups this tool will display level if your pokemon has had one powerup after level too see how these stats can be used to your advantage in battle check out the best attacker and best defender tools major credit to uisitin for digging up the data huge thanks to trainer jarydc for getting the javascript for this across the line at the hour and to ciuff and nylonee for getting the ball rolling
TheSilphRoad,removed,the mons will come this is the reason why ive stopped playing i dont feel like im actually doing anything im walking around aimlessly to find pokémon that i may not even catch it just doesnt feel like a game to me it feels like the pokéwalker from heartgoldsoulsilver except with better graphics
TheSilphRoad,removed,im rooted but am using a workaround for now on top of another workaround since my phone is technically incompatible im sure a lot of legitimate players have given up on playing which i dont think ill ever be able to forgive niantic for
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously i dont know what niantic is doing pogo has been released for like months and we didnt get a single update that actually impacts on the gameplay just a few adjustments and whatever i understand that there were servers overloading botters and so on but hey we are talking about a game that broke lots of records from most downloaded to most profitable imo the community is helping the game much more than niantic itself the appraisal system is more like a response to the thousands of iv calculators which wouldnt be there if it wasnt for the players doing something that should already be in the game like in original gb series there are iv judges in some pokecenters we dont have trades and battles which were both on the trailer the buddy system is nice but it has almost no impact at all the dailyweekly goals you mentioned is indeed a great idea but again this should be in the game every single mobile game i play has this or some achievements that unlocks somehitng i know we have badges but afaik they dont offer anything besides collection proof the only reason i still play is because i am a fan of pokemon and have faith that the battle system wont let me down please
TheSilphRoad,removed,when you try to make a plana goal on a weekly basis for playing a game you have already lost interest and it is time to quit the game it is not your phd dissertation research it is a game
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is like in parts
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats exactly what i was outlining dude use another grass type about level range and tell me how water pulse does against that your team has a hard time training against water pulse but its practically useless against someones ateam
TheSilphRoad,removed,came here to say this while this game may not be a job or a marriage it sure felt like one
TheSilphRoad,removed,if the consumer has to ponder on how to not lose interest this early in the game then the business has a bad model with not enough features niantic screwed up from the very beginning by trying to reskin pokemon over older game data that doesnt match how pokemon actually works people have told them this of times and they refuse to put pokemon anywhere other than in the middle of cities and by beaches i lost interest the moment i opened an app for finding pokemon and it showed about pokemon on a beach in california if thats their model for how the game should work then it directly contradicts their statement of you will need to travel around to catch them all im done flicking balls at the same pokemon and a lot of others figured this out before me i had fun with the game but my friends and i all have the same feeling the game is obviously not thought out enough to be fair to all players it favors players in densely pop cities way more than players who live in rural areas my area isnt even that rural when they fix their code i may come back but i highly doubt that will happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,best comment on here the amount of people that are holding on to this game is shocking its not great accept that and move on
TheSilphRoad,removed,the biggest hit to my interest was last night doing an evolve session and both my charizard and venusaur ended up with practically the worst move sets you could get having been grinding out charmander and bulbasaur candy since the launch of the game this was pretty demoralizing now im afraid to evolve my squirtle when i finally get enough candy for fear that one will end up being a wast too
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know how i would have not lost interest if they actually added any significant updates over the past months of this games existence every other mobile developer knows they need to add new content weekly to keep interest the only thing niantic has added since release is a buddy feature that takes too much effort to get candies for any rare pokemon worth leveling
TheSilphRoad,removed,the people that started to walk more and get exercise would just revert to sitting at home all day i stopped walking as much almost immediatelywhen the tracker went away and it made more sense for me to stay in a select area where the lures were is when my walking in this game dropped
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah this started happening to be waaaaay more after upgrading to ios
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think the main goal of pokemon go is for niantic to make a profit continuously
TheSilphRoad,removed,my wife cant play because her phone is rooted between that the pidgies and the lvl grind ive just stopped caring about this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont just sit there all day i hang out with my friends all day all night at least thats how it feels to me the pokemon catching is almost like a side thing were doing while we chill xd seriously i love grinding cuz the crew i grind with is fucking amazing itd be hard to grind till alone every night thats for sure
TheSilphRoad,removed,is that why i nodded off yawn
TheSilphRoad,removed,solid theory
TheSilphRoad,removed,i didnt get him because i was too far away but ive found the pokemon go map radar to be accurate when ive gone to the spot as a regional exclusive makes no sense to see this on a map in chicago
TheSilphRoad,removed,a real mystery since niantic doesnt communicate
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow you are super awesome winning
TheSilphRoad,removed,a scan theres an app that will tell you the move set of a pokémon before you catch it
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,just curious would a study like the one ive posted here be allowed it uses dark grayish area means but produces amazing data
TheSilphRoad,removed,baahahahaha
TheSilphRoad,removed,its called a shitpost
TheSilphRoad,removed,it was funny the first time
TheSilphRoad,removed,wat not sure if srs
TheSilphRoad,removed,this
TheSilphRoad,removed,i caught a blue eyes white dragon and it turned into a ditto i cant prove it and others cant prove im lying lets just agree to disagree
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,someone had actually posted about this weeks ago i dont remember the whole details but it sounded very similar to what youve described beyond annoying and they wonder why we use scanners
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont like this theres no point
TheSilphRoad,removed,so completing a pokedex is pointless now having a catch rate for a specific pokemon is going to be impossible moving forward i know its a silly accomplishment but we still dont have a good ingame tracker and all tracking services no longer work i played ingress for a year and played pokemon go since release and still play it daily but niantic needs to focus on implementing a good tracker adding trading adding additional ways to earn candy a walk for one candy isnt helping that much and not having a snorlaxlaprasdratinifamily buddy is silly imo and implementing legendariesditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,its too mess with my ocd seen will no longer be the same as caught
TheSilphRoad,removed,its almost like they have all this money now and dont care i honestly dont get it the community is torn between the people preaching how they think niantic wants you to play and the people who say they only use the tracker because the game is lacking one theyve already killed half their peak player base servers will handle the old steps now whats the hold up
TheSilphRoad,removed,sightings works fine learn to use it hell if everyone spend a tenth of the time they use on complaining about trackers on learning to triangulate everyone of them would have a full pokedex by now
TheSilphRoad,removed,this whole game is a liability p the sun and moon demo will blow this game out of the water
TheSilphRoad,removed,in my area half of the reports on the atlas came from me all unconfirmed since the last migration the other half of the reports are all common spawns like paras or pidgey nothing good since they took down the party trackers i havent had much inclination to go out and catch pokemon ive long since lost the will or patience to go out blind hoping for something good to spawn which almost never happens i basically only hold gyms collect coins and hatch eggs since that has become the only way to get rare pokemon for me this game has all but run its course and im hoping niantic adds something to encourage players like me to get back into the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantics priorities are wacked
TheSilphRoad,removed,i saw a dratini on fastpokemaps when it was up so i rushed to go get it as i neared the area a shadow never appeared of the pokémon however when i reached the spot the little bugger was there dont know if that situation happens often but the dratini for sure never showed up on my sightings
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually my pokedex now says ive seen snorlax but the only time ive seen one was in a gym i was never in an encounter with one
TheSilphRoad,removed,a couple hours damn casual players i dont live in the city a couple hours of pogo only gives me a few common pokemon and maybe or not so commons and ill probably hit in hours see how unfair this game is
TheSilphRoad,removed,after all were talking about niantic here amen
TheSilphRoad,removed,not happy having seen a tauros at a gym and knowing that ill have to fly over to the usa to actually catch one feel like it would be a really dick move if i leave a kangaskhan in a usa gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is taking things one step at a time no wonder theyve been messing up so much theyre busy running in circles in a radius
TheSilphRoad,removed,does anyone ask for that that ruined my pokedex it took away the surprising factor to actually unlock it in pokedex
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is listening to the community
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope our future updates are actual updates this makes me roll my eyes wondering what theyre doing to improve our gaming experience
TheSilphRoad,removed,yuk this is horrible
TheSilphRoad,removed,this thing totally ruined my pokedex what a shame
TheSilphRoad,removed,this they are working on but tracking and the gym errors are not worth bothering about fine
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate how rare lapras are
TheSilphRoad,removed,tldr niantic need to rethink almost every stat in the game seriously
TheSilphRoad,removed,sounds like something similar to what gamepress is doing
TheSilphRoad,removed,stupid as thanks for rubbing it in niantic i still havent gotten rare pokemon and now i have more as seen and not caught in my dex
TheSilphRoad,removed,not like it will work anyway reported cheaters still see around that one probably got bored of cheating instead of being banned seen way more cheaters but couldnt be bothered reporting them anymore the only way to deal with cheating is to turn a blind eye to it because there is nothing we can do if niantic doesnt give a damn
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is crap imho
TheSilphRoad,removed,once i wrote a stupid comment too then when it received downvotes i cried and cried to my mommy then i deleted the comment and drank out of my bottle the
TheSilphRoad,removed,git gud
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am writing my masters thesis on this as well it would be an honor to collaborate a little with you in terms of citations and your literature review because i am not sure what direction i am going in terms of physical or mental health perswayablegmailcom if you have time and thanks for sharing this
TheSilphRoad,removed,games are art and john hanke throws a tantrum when someone plays in a way he didnt think about when the minimally viable product was released then he pulled a bait and switch this is niantics fault fuck them they lost my respect for them long ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,assuming he didnt just like the number and reported it because of that
TheSilphRoad,removed,and yes doing this gets them permanently banned from contributing or participating in the roads network including from future features of the silph road etc why dont you just disallow the reporting of legendaries and ditto nests and thats it and possibly regionals out of their region if its not too hard to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,seconded didnt work for me either fuck being an android user
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats kind of annoying
TheSilphRoad,removed,iirc and in line with my experiences nice great excellent curveball razzberry
TheSilphRoad,removed,did your post get removed by the nazi mods who hate the two letters i and v
TheSilphRoad,removed,i believe nest reports will be a lot less accurate and less quick to update now with scanners down when a bad nest was reported it was very easy for several people to confirmdeny the nest without leaving the house i went to the only reported nest in our town to update it on the sitei didnt see person playing while i was there
TheSilphRoad,removed,but i just caught an eevee with iv in two tries so i would like to theorycraft that if you catch an eevee in more than two tries its safe to say it wont be iv iactually think this is very insightful why is this just a comment hold on let me start a thread
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can turn it off with reddit gold
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive also experienced this i think the nest atlas is just a glorified science fair project
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol got scammed bud
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow you seriously have to insert your political bullshit here just to destroy our countrys image john hanke was having a lot of fun when i saw him here and he was obviously very fond of our country that he made the globe deal making it one of the first few sponsored pokestop deals in the world
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i assume you dont follow filipino politics so if youre interested in visiting the country for whatever god forsaken reason head over to rphilippines my comment was in no way an exaggeration there is a growing anti american sentiment and extra judicial killings ejk you will run into this term a lot are common at the hands of police and vigilantes their president has given explicit endorsement asking the public to kill as many drug addicts because according to him their families are too cowardly to do so as possible with the promise of no legal rammifications as you may have guessed many innocent people have been killed because all it takes to get away with murder is placing a sign next to their body calling them a drug dealer this is not a good time to visit the philippines what is happening is shameful and no one can guarantee your safety if you venture out from the richest areas of manila
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow thats incredible only been posted every hour for the last week
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope it lasts into nov but knowing experienced niantics quality coding firsthand with multiple serious bugs introduced with every update i wouldnt be surprised if it ended halfway into actual halloween
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you want to fight gyms with all lapras and snorlax cause thats how you get it they will never increase the spawns for those cause it would destroy the already dieing gym game
TheSilphRoad,removed,this idea is posted every day
TheSilphRoad,removed,beat me too it lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,enough bs already effort to build a level gym is minimal compared to effort of taking down a lvl gym for example here near the place i live yesterday at team valor tore down our gym built it up to level with alt account horsea takes within minutes the gym is fully stacked somebody lets call him friend yes im pretending to be naive here from opponent team kick out a horsea and the slot is immediately filled with valor i build level gym in the same spot in the middle of a day and it takes hours to be filled usually with low level noobs yes i use my main account to place horsea no alt accounts thus sacrificing my position in the gym i build yeah there is totally no problem with gym stagnation lets move on to next topic
TheSilphRoad,removed,plus everyone has a solution that either doesnt change much or is actually a worse option coins bounty for taking down a gym that has been up for days now explain how this is worse people would actually go around and tear down stagnant gyms the horror
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats as clear as mud then
TheSilphRoad,removed,is the pokefast app safe
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah i had to change address overall thank you nontheless
TheSilphRoad,removed,is it bad i hope the one someone i ran into tonight does that he was very pompous about being totally legit as he was looking at a scanner showing near by pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank you very much for this info i always thought that the pokemon where more accurate the more players there are in a certain area but not to the extent of them being on the tweaked version
TheSilphRoad,removed,the newer updates of pokego enable users to check ivs as they catch pokemon and on the map is this data still collected from others using this tweak or directly from the api
TheSilphRoad,removed,im done with this game it was fun in the beginning it just got so tiresome to wait for a decent fix which still hasnt arrived imo im not a heavy player and i think i got banned since i cant log in i get some cant authentic error that pops up when i try to log in mind you i havent spoofed just have used the party clients for tracking maybe in the future ill go back to it until then im leaving this game alone
TheSilphRoad,removed,more the merrier its good to get a feel for how other people are going about this stuff especially the less hardcore of us who arent kicking around the upper
TheSilphRoad,removed,the usage of trackerradar appssites is so obviously cheating and a huge problem no its playing the game the way it was intended its supposed to be go catch em all not just catch whatever shows up on your screen
TheSilphRoad,removed,solution just log in to a dummy account when that dummy gets banned move on
TheSilphRoad,removed,are apps like go radar safe to use then
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes the ones that dont require a login have somebody elses accounts being used and in those cases those accounts are being banned in the latters regard the trainers account isnt being banned correct
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats the site
TheSilphRoad,removed,then they need to loop the players in on their grand plan before people lose interest and leave
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe if you read one of his follow up replies to someone who answered him youd see that you are clearly wrong in your assumption dont be a dick
TheSilphRoad,removed,its good to see they our main priority is to provide a fair and still didnt allow request for pokestops or gym i play since day one and only have pokestop in a people town and its like out of town we used to organize trips with everyone here to the nearest city to be able to play pokemonwe were around people and we could only play like a day now we are only friends that go there weekly and we are only able to play pokemon go for like hours while we have people playing pokemon go with pokestops every
TheSilphRoad,removed,which london usa canada uk where
TheSilphRoad,removed,couldnt you just turn off the share data tab in the bottom of go
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like the idea but really nothing about niantic makes me think theyd use this data and theyre cool with such a super patchy urban favorable system that i suspect this would be a lot of energy that comes to nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,when you preorder you get a big dick in your mouth
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres a semipopular streamer living in sf who streams all his gameplay so i know hes not bottedcheated somehow he showed his journalachievements he has walked the same distance as me give or take he is level and i am level because he lives in sf and i live in a comparatively tiny area hes filled his pokedex and has every mon he wants whereas im on the postcode lottery in this game is ridiculous and something id be livid about if the competitive aspect of the game wasnt mostly meaningless
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really wish this post didnt have so much fluff in it
TheSilphRoad,removed,amen to this i also use fastpokemap as a stopgap until we get something useful the fun part of the game for me is now the excitement of seeing a pokemon despawning in less than minutes and i have to run to find it in time trying to match the pogo map up with the fastpokemap map if niantic can ever make their own tracker that supplies that kind of excitement as well as accurately tracks the pokemon ill drop fastpokemap in a heartbeat
TheSilphRoad,removed,each enduser app can be used as a collection tool by the app creator invisibly collecting and forwarding data to the app creator with or without the knowledge of the end user despite being a good intention its kind of fun coming from john hank the one accused of stealing wifi data when the google cars were roaming cities
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre going to be waiting a looooooong time bub
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont think its reasonable to expect that niantic offer moving assistance to rural players s
TheSilphRoad,removed,you should get a life spend your money and time to stop cheaters lol report and move on buddy
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpspokeassistantcommainivcalculator if you fully powered up that dragonite at your current trainer level it would have a cp of between and if you can narrow down its exact level and ivs you can narrow that range
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre not funny people like you are ruining the experience for everyone else get fucked
TheSilphRoad,removed,hello first a few disclaimers play the game however you like as long as youre having fun and not hurting others fun feel free to ignore all this nerd stuff you can handily win almost every pokemon battle without worrying about this stuff this is for those who really enjoy minmaxing who want to minimize wasted potions or who want to prepare for real pvp in pokemon go better movesetmatchup better cp within reason ivs more information in the spreadsheet linked below the images are the culmination of a lot of work for me these are based on my spreadsheet which in turn is based on the excellent work of uprofessorkukui i took his spreadsheet and incorporated type advantages which frequently provide a increase in duel ability if youre interested in diving deeper ive tried to make the spreadsheet as userfriendly as possible let me know if you have questions on how to use it i invite feedback of all kind ive checked all of my equations several times but its possible that there may be improvements to make also if anyone wants any more matchup charts eg one for fighting fire types i can very easily make them using the spreadsheet so ask away
TheSilphRoad,removed,i actually enjoyed the grind in ffxi sit in a single location and pull mobs to your team is infinity better than kill as many as possible as quickly as you can that i see in korean games
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao blue mage i quit by the time that was released
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah shits garbage lol keep getting errors also nty
TheSilphRoad,removed,he and eevee are in cahoots with that cute little u wot mate head cock
TheSilphRoad,removed,accurate iv checking is something that the game needs its something that exists for the actual video games through third party and we need let us use accurate iv checkers or the game isnt worth playing i wont be wasting stardust and eggs on something that has low ivs until this is implemented myself and thousands if not millions of others will be using third party programs
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokealert pokenotify fastpokemap skiplagged
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh no im sorry i didnt mean to make it sound like that its hard not to like poliwrath lol but i believe were in a disagreement my poliwrath nowadays is my first defender because my area has a dedicated group of lvl that add to gyms regularly so i know a higher cp will mostly overtake leader in my gym last time i checked poliwrath is top in gym defending most people put in snorlaxlaprasarcaninethe usual so putting in my poliwrath adds type variety same reason i put in clefablewigglytuff
TheSilphRoad,removed,so i can make money selling dragonites that take me seconds to find via gps spoofing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i tried to resolve this looking for evidence instead i found a thread where people say they couldnt get their dragonite past level without using a tool thats against the tos
TheSilphRoad,removed,i got lucky n hatched snorlaxes that gave each
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean i had a jolly good laugh at you deciding that hp remaining matters in the first fight where they happen to end in a mutual charge attack ko and then pretending that it doesnt matter in the second or third fights against flareon or chansey where the higher iv vaporeon comes away with notably more health but good effort i guess i cooked up a scenario where ivs do not play a big role therefore they never play a big role and easilycookable scenarios where they play a massively inflated role would totally not disprove this does not a solid topic make
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah meta whining just what we needed s
TheSilphRoad,removed,its just another way of making more people leave this game we cant use trackerswhich i understand and we have no way of knowing if were walking in the right direction and now we cant even drive around trying to find some good spawns if they keep this up most of the hardcore players that have been putting money into this game will quit im really tired of sitting on lures in the offchance that something rare will pop up every three months
TheSilphRoad,removed,that subreddit feels disgusting to look at now barely any entertaining posts to look at just the suggestions posts that niantic will never implement anytime soon because they are human beings who have probably decided what updates to implement and posts about trackers for the sake of practically cheating the real mistake here was people thinking a mobile game could be as deep as the core pokemon games though ill always appreciate the quality of life updates that shipped and the efforts of silph roads analysis of whats already in the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,im hoping this is the first step in releasing the new internal tracker imagine getting notifications when youre near a rare spawn one can always dream
TheSilphRoad,removed,people are judged by their actions and not what we hope they will do niantics actions releasing antiroot security as well as their inaction not rolling out a working scanner do not give many people reasons for optimism i am sure some major changes will come eventually but who knows how many will be left compared to the peak sure pogo will not die but one wonders how many more would stick with the game if niantic had acted on some fronts and not omitted on others
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they really made this a feature and it isnt a bug i wont be playing this game much anymore and definitely wont give niantic more money
TheSilphRoad,removed,this just makes me really angry niantic is really doing everythinh they can to remove all possible joy from this game if the trackers doesnt come back this is the end of pogo for me payinh playet with pogo and fed up of what niantic is doing
TheSilphRoad,removed,buttons instead of works great as a passenger i would never recommend a driver to do this
TheSilphRoad,removed,nailed it
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongo is unreadable most of the haters suffer from lack of patience and an overwhelming sense of entitlement the cancerous attitude they perpetuate has done more harm than niantic ever could i still love the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,first person to post r gets banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,my kids and i are so disappointed in this change theyre my sightings watchers while we drive the rural and suburban backroads where walking is pointless we went out for a hunting trip tonight and there was nothing on the sightings for almost all of our trip is just too slow on rural roads or youll get run over they were bored and playing other games after a while and all agreed that without sightings working this game is dead to them im sorry to go against the silph road mantra of positivity but this change is really a game killer for us
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have played metric butt tons of games seen how developers do things wow color me impressed
TheSilphRoad,removed,tldr
TheSilphRoad,removed,can confirm utter garbage there
TheSilphRoad,removed,brushing aside all complaints even the legitimate ones as whining is pretty disingenuous
TheSilphRoad,removed,a three month old free game they are bringing in million a day i dont think its fair to call it a free game while you can play it for free its a pretty terrible game if you dont spend any money on it maybe not in some areas near high density stopsspawns but for a large number of people and i dont think its meant to be a free game while you can play without incubators lures and bag expansions the game is much less without them were not talking about just hats or skins in the store
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is hype may never die
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive defended niantic a lot and agree with the issue of negativity in rpokemongo but for me the decision to force us to choose lower pokemon every time we train even on a one pokemon gym so that we can get rather than prestige really makes me question if the developers even play the game it is such a simple design issue and its a new game is no excuse for it makes it really hard to defend them
TheSilphRoad,removed,i still remember the complete lack of response to portal submissions and the dozens of mine and my friends that never received a response and the terrible design of the recruiter medal that most people i know refuse to even earn bronze for
TheSilphRoad,removed,the line is so skewed at this point i just do what i feel is right within the game im not the morality police lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i understand that looking at what an appraisal means is interesting until the silph road has it built into their site youre definitely free to use the one on gamepress website the appraisal only is here httpspokemongogamepressggpokemonappraisal the iv calc appraisal is here httpspokemongogamepressggpokemongoivcalculator
TheSilphRoad,removed,winter is really going to make this worse as soon as snow happens the sidewalks in my area will be gone entirely and it will not be safe to walk on the sides of the road
TheSilphRoad,removed,this post is in and of itself whining
TheSilphRoad,removed,fractions of one percent are you in primary school or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think youre both right so lets just say it needs to be clearer in my toplevel post i deliberately said constructive criticism im all for people venting sometimes you need to do that it should just lead somewhere if you have a complaint also at least have an idea of a solution what would fix it for you what would make you happy for an example im really irritated at the speed change as a rural player its basically killed the game for us my kids are sad we have to drive to play we go around areas and stop when something good happens we dont have nests my solution undo what they just did my comment its niantic sometimes you need to vent because they are an extremely secretive capricious frustrating group i quit ingress lots of us did not for no reason and therein lies the point udronpes has to come up with a way to deal with this because it will bubble over for me this is a major gamebreaking deal eventually under pressure things will pop it takes two to tango people wouldnt be frustrated if niantic werent frustrating us the expectations for expression of this natural series of reactions needs to be welldefined it will happen to you and everyone else people will all get mad niantic does that they arent like dotavalve where they bend over backwards to make the community happy and value feedback like gold if this were i would say what do you have to be so upset about with niantic i am more lenient we all should be
TheSilphRoad,removed,have lost many of the fairweather fans this is not something to be proud of are you a shareholder of niantic niantic have made terrible decisions with this license and as a player of their game my only loyalty is to myself if i enjoy the game or not i either play or i dont sticking with it doesnt make you worthy of praise for yuor determination it makes you an idiot because your not getting paid for it its ok to admit that something you spent a lot of time on has been wasted thats life pretending everything is rosy is just falling victim to the sunk cost fallacy this community is great because it provides more indepth information about the game but the game sucks it was released in beta and its gotten worse as time has gone on niantic have dropped the ball on this
TheSilphRoad,removed,the biggest issue with this whole system is the lack clarification on the the appwebsite about what constitute a spawn my area is covered with magikarp nests which in reality are just water spawn areas that isnt a nest it shouldnt be on a nest app i dont even understand why a single frequent spawn point would be on a nest map that isnt a nest
TheSilphRoad,removed,ahead of fallout come on
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is a mew in san francisco that is all
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really loved this game but it honestly became more compulsive than enjoyable for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,people still play this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,detailed discussion and analysis doesnt preclude negative ideas and views
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can bet that niantic is working on something tracker related i have to disagree here as far as all the evidence point to niantic having totally dropped the ball on this they have left a obviously flawed halffinished beta in sanfrancisco for over a month with no progress or communication at all my reading of the situation is that niantic believe they can do no wrong that they can ignore all the calls for a tracker and that the drop in users isnt in any way connected to it being hugely successful because of a fluke someone in charge of pokemon licencing being an ingress player gives people like john hanke a feeling of invulnerability how can we possibly be right about a game design issue when hes the one who came up with a billion dollar app i wouldnt be at all surprised if hes stopped tracker development out of spite and nobody at niantic has the power to tell him hes wrong thats why this thread worries me if the most respected pokemon community reinforces his worldview and bans dissent then the users will never get the changes they want its obvious that niantic has to change its culture and this community should be speeding that process up not prolonging the status quo
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is so stupid and might be the worst update for legit players so far i feel so sorry for all the people out there having a great time playing some on the way to work on public transport not to mention all the people having all sightings disappear just because of gps jumping the only reason i bought pogo plus was to use while driving or on public transport the catch rate is so bad that i would never consider using it when not moving fast if you are waiting for pogo plus then cancel your order because now with this update its just not worth it i hope they reverse the change or at least double the speed limit
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope you and all the people who use thia get banned permanently with no reimbursement or appeals screw you dude seriously go to hell
TheSilphRoad,removed,just like those real word refugees that took over the host countries and brought in their barbaric values with them instead of assimilate ban those fuckers and build a great wall
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey kids remember when they said you could use this while riding a bike well too bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,anybody try returning their device i spent cad all in this is ridiculous
TheSilphRoad,removed,now kiss
TheSilphRoad,removed,been using it for weeks no issues and im still playing despite niantics efforts to kill their game
TheSilphRoad,removed,hard to nudge you towards a place of business if youre busy running settle down citizen
TheSilphRoad,removed,they love to do so what is love
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is going to kill of my playing im now one less avid player one more casual player and probably soon a former player
TheSilphRoad,removed,the other thing that frustrates me is the posts of people trying to petition niantic it does little to further the conversation about the game it just smacks of entitlement to expect niantic to tailor its game to the opinion of the internet people here have offered a number of thoughtful solutions and upgrades and even worked out how they could be implemented obviously smart people it wont actually change anything so i dont get the hype
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed completely the board cant feasibly get rid of all the repetitive whining nor should they but boy it does get tiring after a while
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop removing comments aholes
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not a free game they are making millions out of it they have an obligation both to their shareholders and to the players else why make a monetized game i know you guys want to have a carebear community but indicating issues where they exist is never a bad thing especially with a business
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpmtwinpeaksrestaurantcom
TheSilphRoad,removed,gaming is evening a chore
TheSilphRoad,removed,would you believe i had to repost because the word shit triggered some troll alert
TheSilphRoad,removed,how many times has that happened
TheSilphRoad,removed,sounds like youre one of those guilty until proven innocent types get bent
TheSilphRoad,removed,condescending much
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyones becoming rude and crazy this year i blame trump and farage
TheSilphRoad,removed,hmmm niantic will just need to remove more remove sightings all together niantic there are still too many people playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you currently are in possession of a valid drivers license you should do the world a favor and throw it away people die because of your idiotic kind of thinking
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh my god
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive started visiting rpokemongo more now because they dont censor discussion about tracking as much
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am a very beginning player myself so my option is also valid but that is just it your opinion as my opinion is my own however the fact is niantic is losing tons of players due to their choices on the failed tracker and speed bans as a couple of examples if you are still enjoying the game thats great but there are tons of players who are done
TheSilphRoad,removed,i play on the bus two hours a day thats the vast majority of my play i mentioned it in several posts on that thread i was downvoted specifically for saying not to play while driving
TheSilphRoad,removed,well where i live its illegal to carry a knife over a certain length its also illegal to fiddle with your mobile phone while driving so i guess that covers the banning aspect its banned now how about trying to stop people from stabbing each other or playing mobile phone games while driving any suggestions
TheSilphRoad,removed,i guess having a go pilot now is useless guess my time of wanting to eagerly tag along with my parents to run errands is done time to crawl back to my room and stay on the computer thanx niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,it wasnt from pogo but by texting someone i caused a crash and totalled my car and someone elses luckily no one was hurt please dont do something stupid like i did dont mess with your phone while driving i was extremely lucky i dont know what i would have done if i had killed someone before the accident i had never had an accident or ever had car trouble i thought i was a fantastic driver the car in front of me breaked suddenly for a dog running in the road i didnt see it i hit him and smashed both cars pretty bad the dog was fine its a minor thing now year later but it could have been really really bad i am now the super stick in the mud when riding with friends i do not let them text while driving
TheSilphRoad,removed,no dodge shut up
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should demand a refund
TheSilphRoad,removed,you dont really need a study to call this bs i bought a go so i can cath pokemon on the tram to work i cant do this anymore so thats € down the toilet in my case you cant just remove features from the hardware you sell thats a really dick move from niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i havent made any comment at all in this post about niantics introduction of a speed lock i know what mass transit is i play on it hours a day every day it should go without saying but dont make assumptions yes that
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not sure how anybody could have drawn that conclusion the original comment sinking like a brick was a direct reply to the op in most other comments on that thread i mentioned that i play on the bus hrs a day
TheSilphRoad,removed,any sub that justifies distracted driving is trash
TheSilphRoad,removed,what the hell is this
TheSilphRoad,removed,but everyone leave star reviews theyll listen to those and all the super negative review comments right that sub is a laughing stock if you hate the game so much just walk away completely
TheSilphRoad,removed,u exposed your fake account
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,i totally would but i can barely run the game as it is me too of ram isnt enough to run this game properly i know niantic could optimize it better for devices but they dont care about that
TheSilphRoad,removed,its an unacceptable bug especially if you like to listen to podcasts when catching pocket monsters
TheSilphRoad,removed,pgo has any sounds s
TheSilphRoad,removed,it still loops horribly they embedded it as before compile which causes a short delay at the beginning of the audio instead of embedding it as wav and compiling to any game dev should know this its audio
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a bug the game is locked to fps for me ever since the beginning i have had random moments where the game shoots up to and it feels amazing but its clearly a glitch as animations particles and physics are made for fps niantic being as dumb as they are seems to have made ball throwing force related to the delta of something between two frames instead of time so when trying to catch at fps youll see the ball tends to overshoot and go into space
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you dont wine and dine a person of power when you want an outcome you are just an idiot or underfunded
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would not recommend visiting the philippines if you look american their national embarrassment of a president has made racism against foreigners publicly acceptable not to mention the principle of choosing not to support a government encouraging the murder of its own citizens and sometimes foreigners maybe when filipinos decide to grow up and dump trumpterte their country will be worth visiting but in the meantime no
TheSilphRoad,removed,just you the trainer trade menu oh wait thats not part of the game yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,well im not in center city i bet those have higher turnover i live in manayunk within walking distance of that i can take at night before i claim i work in bucks county and have found a couple nearly abandoned gyms that i can hold with just my pokemon in there for days at a time the others are gyms along my way to work in ft washingtongermantown gyms that i found at level or up and prestiged then put my pokemon at the top those stand forever in some areas and are built right back up when they go down im instinct too if i was blue or red itd be much easier
TheSilphRoad,removed,the wife and i just burned down level gyms since my last comment by all means keep complaining that someone should do it for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,returning from where
TheSilphRoad,removed,rthathappened
TheSilphRoad,removed,troll
TheSilphRoad,removed,things im waiting for is pokemongo and hillary clintons indictment in that order
TheSilphRoad,removed,and
TheSilphRoad,removed,the markets on my atlas are just numbers is there a way to change it for those of us hat dont have the pokedex numbers memorized
TheSilphRoad,removed,but it would be yet another external tool having its usefulness reduced
TheSilphRoad,removed,this was hilarious read did you tell your mom about this already
TheSilphRoad,removed,its sad that i wouldnt be surprised by niantic doing something like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,its the opposite for me the nest atlas just points out the glaring issues that are making me play less and less like the game being more enjoyable depending on where you live and because of this the pogo community in my city went from being the nightly thing to do down town to one other trainer downtown in my last trips
TheSilphRoad,removed,people out in the real world are not using it hardly any points haveare being reported in the uk
TheSilphRoad,removed,why does everyone here spend so much time talking about how they hardly play
TheSilphRoad,removed,it was just so much easier to search and confirm with the help of scanners
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should make it so you can text or use im apps while playing pogo so you cant cheat by speaking to other people who might be playing then i suppose you could cheat by using your voice though
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont pokestop and drive niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,good job now all we need is for niantic to stop moving things around every few days so we can get a good read on whats around
TheSilphRoad,removed,ideally trading should never be allowed in pogo i simply see way more negatives than positives if it was implemented maybe npc trading can work
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow this is exciting heres hoping my cubone nest switches to charmander dratini kabuto or ghastly
TheSilphRoad,removed,good point with the id
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic still wants a tracking system the issue is the current system is a minimally viable product and in non open areas turns the game into blind mans bluff
TheSilphRoad,removed,that the spawn timer should be increased until such tracking is added then imagine the complaints when the timer is lowered again i think its a loselose proposition and no changes will be coming but to beat a dead horse further these issues could easily be solved via some communication were aware that the lack of tracking makes finding pokémon within the minute spawn window difficult we are working on a way to reintroduce tracking something something reason for keeping the window at minutes something something
TheSilphRoad,removed,in theory it works in practice it is completely impractical
TheSilphRoad,removed,to be fair to the guy its not a very fun implementation of tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,was only able to play while riding the bus to work with the speed limit being imposed now the game is virtually impossible to play shame on you niantic making it harder for legit players people with disabilities and children to play your game with winter about to set in the player base will significantly drop with these changes i rarely see anyone play anymore at parks now as it is keep rolling out the game to new areas to make your money perhaps you should fix what is broken and make the game fun again with these changes they have made the game inaccessible to many less fun for all
TheSilphRoad,removed,i thought i was the only one getting pidgeys that werent listed love trainer tips great content excellent presentation
TheSilphRoad,removed,that seems kinda stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,in fact it does not hold any water the tracker needs to calculate the distance anyway so giving it the three footsteps would not add any significant additional load i really dont understand why they did remove it it seems like a great and intuitive tracker that being said my impression is that niantic does intend to fix tracking but they will not do it certainly their current trial is utterly useless for most people
TheSilphRoad,removed,current system is ok just for chasing pokemons in big parks i was chasing jigillytough in the center of city like you did garydos and it disappeared times in then few days later i found fpm and while playing around i realized spawn points are in silly places so often that i would miss many of them without fpm then i came to village and read fpm is disabled
TheSilphRoad,removed,a girl that isnt just humoring pokemon hunting and a blastoise my in game experience differs wildly
TheSilphRoad,removed,can confirm that snorlax surprised the shit out of me couldnt believe i found one without any tracker or notification just poof there it is
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think youve pretty much hit the nail on the head here same as everyone else is saying sooner the tracker is back the better
TheSilphRoad,removed,pr
TheSilphRoad,removed,let me translate you can run around like a moron looking for ghastlys on halloween because we still have no tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,what if we stopped speculating about something we know for sure is not in the game yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,and now the servers are stable and the game is awful great
TheSilphRoad,removed,unfortnely i think is just a normal post
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah lets water down the conversation with some regurgitated ditto theories based on nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,what if you pulled the stick out of your bum it was a joke halloween people wear costumes ditto shape shifts and can look like anything wtf is your problem are you so butthurt about the thing not being in the game that it seriously offends you when someone makes a joke about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,doubt it
TheSilphRoad,removed,cp is now the most important pokémon stat niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,means only people in san francisco will see an increased rate of ghost pokemon spawns
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes it was six months ago were really running out of things to talk about huh hah
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you remember when rthesilphroad wasnt me either
TheSilphRoad,removed,a gym of my team i dont believe it
TheSilphRoad,removed,boo instinct
TheSilphRoad,removed,can i get your downvote back please i took it back
TheSilphRoad,removed,i remember when we had everything we wanted then niantic came in and grabbed it all away and replaced it with crap
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly most of his tips are really newbie so it doesnt surprise me at all that hes a low level
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a lg user i am not ok lots of people must have quit the game because it doesnt even open normally you have to do a trick for it to start this did not happen before the last god damn forsaken update plus the gyms are laggy as hell its not even enjoyable anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,i very ok with it less new content more players quitting free coins and stardust for weeks
TheSilphRoad,removed,well you havent tried training gyms and dodging glich killing your pokemon i will run out of revives because of this and cant battle like i used
TheSilphRoad,removed,duck you but duck niantic more this game has been utter horse sith since the last update having to use workarounds to load the game still crashes just as often and spoofers are more prevalent than ever theyre well overdue for an update but they need to make sure it works this time
TheSilphRoad,removed,well the last update made the dodgebuttakefulldamageanyway bug ten times worse and niantic hasnt even acknowledged that that is bs and they are bs and im not okay with that
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have been looking for an scanner like that on my area how did you find it
TheSilphRoad,removed,please dont post here
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been nearly a month since the last app update and you know what im not okay with that
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah we shouldnt use scanners the ingame tracker is great and shows you everything that spawns around you oh wait
TheSilphRoad,removed,more like update needed asap as it is near unplayable on this version crashes just to get it to boot up once is unacceptable the gyms are also completely broken for me the game freezes for me when i try to dodge a hyper beam and literally prevents dodge input so i get hit every time i also crashed during a gym fight rebooted after crashes yep healed my team moved on and had to heal them a second time because it fainted all again what a way to waste revives and max potions because they cant fix their game
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not ok with it bugs need fixing minor text needs fixing more gen needs adding
TheSilphRoad,removed,grab my crotch whats my name been round the block
TheSilphRoad,removed,stupid rule anyways and rarely adhered to
TheSilphRoad,removed,to be fair the fad has passed people who played religiously dont even open the app anymore and thats if they havent deleted it i would play more if the distance for eggs and buddies actually worked and we had a tracker but now ill open it look around at my suburban neighborhood with pokestops for miles and exit out there are still plenty of people who play it dont get me wrong but this game is probably at of the player base it had the first week of its launch
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokefastse comes back online and go hits again shocker
TheSilphRoad,removed,they are so common for me i wouldnt know what not having one is like i literally just opened the game to do some tidying up and caught a at my house yet to hatch one but ive got ivsome are now evolved in my bags theyre just so common in my area you will trip over a iv without trying
TheSilphRoad,removed,slowpoke picture
TheSilphRoad,removed,when the game was released i knew about playing now theres nobody left no useful tracker no point in walking mindlessly around without aim
TheSilphRoad,removed,what did they do thats positive i heard they made the game unplayable if youre moving faster than walking speed
TheSilphRoad,removed,then get over it
TheSilphRoad,removed,not that i know of is this not happening for others
TheSilphRoad,removed,gj
TheSilphRoad,removed,one of the stupidest posts i have seen today
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats so hard with using a pokémon that has equal or less cp than the weakest gym defender say the gym has a cp golem as its weakest defender as long as you have a vaporeon that is less than cp and greater than probably cp you can get prestige per fight easily just run after the first round you people who train till the end with your highest cp are crazy
TheSilphRoad,removed,just got the device not compatible message without a rootnice
TheSilphRoad,removed,still getting the incompatibility issue message so frustrating
TheSilphRoad,removed,push for the silphroad app i defintely wann itd greetings from germany
TheSilphRoad,removed,and playerbase will be just a little higher than per city because of incompatible devices
TheSilphRoad,removed,make pokemon go great again
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey yoyou is a good hombre i needs my notifications backgochat and fpm life
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats nice note that i dont agree with these trackers but niantic has developed a sightings ill be using those tracking until niantic creates something really helpful to use in game
TheSilphRoad,removed,up and runninguntil the next update
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would be tempted to use a scanner if one of the big three showed up on my sightings screen its tough enough to catch a dragonite once you encounter it but it is beyond frustrating to run around for ten or fifteen minutes trying to find it only to have it disappear from the screen whats even more frustrating is the known issue of pokémon disappearing from the screen even when they are still in range the problem
TheSilphRoad,removed,good keep the pressure up on niantic it is complete bs that niantic does not have this down as a major priority with daily or weekly updates it is ridiculous they are dragging their feet this hard
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres to hoping the other trackers around the world will come online as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you dead
TheSilphRoad,removed,or sth like a indicator that lets you know if you are getting closer to a pokemon ooooor further away
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool cool
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think they are making the game for profit not the community im worried that niantic is now going to slap a cd on fpm theyve done it before but they thought they could win the race now that they cant theyre going to go back to old proven methods
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow if i was at a desk id stand on it and say oh captian my captian
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a very interesting letter and i fully agree with it the hotspot in my area used to have people playing since all your changes changing the api there are only playing of users left the game im not surprised since my local triplelure farm is almost dead all my friends already left you may dont support the trackersscanners but these are keeping the last players alive were i live i dont be surprised if niantic releases a payed trackers or something like a super incense to show all pokemons within a larger area
TheSilphRoad,removed,fpm
TheSilphRoad,removed,i used the scanners to see what was around me in my neighborhood to see if it was worth my effort to go out and look around i wasnt going to go out for pidgeys and ratatas and as ive complained about numerous times the migration wiped the spawn points around my house away and fun of seeing if it might be a magikarp slowpoke or psyduck around the corner just went away i still play the game i still like checking my gyms but going out and hunting is not something ive done in a few weeks i love playing this with my son and i hope niantic finds a way to make it enjoyable for us again local nest changes to zubats caterpies and oddishes doesnt help either
TheSilphRoad,removed,letting people reverse engineer the game means letting people cheat you dont need to reverse engineer to cheat
TheSilphRoad,removed,many games leave it open to the public so that they can understand the mechanics in a deep and thorough way knowing how things are computed actual catch rates etc all help the community whether the game is open or closed there will be cheaters point me to a single game that doesnt have them the real problem is the way niantic implements everything not having enough people to deal with the issues we encounter not listening to the needs of the community and addressing them to make the game enjoyable again they want to make money on the game i get that but it isnt rocket science to know that if your fanbase is larger you will make more money
TheSilphRoad,removed,mods have been a part of gaming for a very long time numerous ui tweaks like healbot in wow made a world of difference for raiding and blizzard embraced those tweaks because it made their game better and more interesting to play iv checking and tracking strikes me as the same kind of thing way more people want to play that game than the one niantic is trying to force their customers to play the cats already out of the bag players are walking around all over the world with dozens of snorlaxes and dragonites removing the option to hunt the way that those players did just stratifies play even further
TheSilphRoad,removed,selfentitled dbag
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic has obligations to meet and has to understand the impact of each update its easy for him to judge cause hes not part of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i remember being able to see them yeah didnt bother me enormously being banned for not having an expensive phone long of does though
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont use fpm but i like it for one very important reason to put pressure on niantic to bring the original tracker back and i mean the tracker from the beta version with it worked and was adding a whole new level of joy to the game and while i understand that the huge server load from the tens of millions of simultaneous players forced niantic to suspend the tracker for stability reasons that problem should no longer exist now a working tracker that tells you look there is a lapras meters from where you are now would be so exciting especially for casual players and bring many of them back to the game the determination and popularity of fpm and others should help to encourage ninatic bringing it back
TheSilphRoad,removed,when there is an easy cheat avaiable people use it when there is a hidden bugged button that doubles your success people will press it the community asks for a tracker that is okay but those maps are the real fall of pokemon go i used them a lot and it sucks how it changed how you played this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,every game has prophecies of doom proclaimed by sections of the online community when the developer makes unpopular decisions theres a difference between prophecy and reality i believe the author overexaggerated but im seeing the same thing locally we had parks that were full of people all day the areas were lured all day and there were a lot of people throughout the day now the parks are empty we recently had an event to try and get more people out maybe showed up used to be hundreds now there are so few what will happen with winter how many people will survive the winter without quitting not everyone wants to drive around and play so how will niantic keep people interested during the cold when they cant keep people interested when the weather is good someone mentioned how games like wow warcraft etc embraced the community niantic is trying to push it away
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a way bigger percentage than you give it credit for everybody ive met while playing in the last three weeks or so had been using city wide trackers and chasing big game at least some of the time that they were playing until it stopped being an option now a lot of those players are hanging it up and finding something else to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,more like a bank adopting a strict dress code for customers keep out the people most likely to cause trouble and not make them a profit based on profiling
TheSilphRoad,removed,regarding your first point the people who reverse engineered the api this time are aware that releasing it would allow botting to resume again which is one factor behind why they are considering not releasing it to the public of course this could also be a convenient excuse to allow fpm to monopolize scanning and rake in the ad revenue who knows
TheSilphRoad,removed,allowing for reverse engineering allows for much more than just scanners i guess youve never heard the notion of readonly api they have the power to bring players back lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,lets face it you need fpm going blind with the current sighting system make a lot of players left its somewhat cheating but at an acceptable level because it requires you to walk to the location i blame the botters and gps spoofing more though
TheSilphRoad,removed,game envisions tell me about game envisions when no one else will be playing this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,man youve got a marowak there stop hunting for that paras
TheSilphRoad,removed,what he gives exactly what community asks just because niantic is so incompetent to release a working tracker do you think will be a fpm if ingame tracker works
TheSilphRoad,removed,true you need an euro one i mean honestly the game lags all the time and runs poorly on even an
TheSilphRoad,removed,scanner maps
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow if an doesnt work thats going to affect a lot of people
TheSilphRoad,removed,google gave me my money back when i called and told them that niantic blocked me from using my purchases even though i never violated the tos rooted phone its worth a shot got me back that i wasted on that company
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont believe that safetynet is the reason for the improved experience rather disabling the api is
TheSilphRoad,removed,try creating one gmail is a piece of cake
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this is good because i got a dragonite from a iv dragonair that came from a iv dratini that i hatched i got it by farming the shit out of dratini spawns in a nearby apartment complex at a university nearby that has a fresh water pond after driving around this complex for about straight days to my surprise i got pulled over by the university pd who told me that people were becoming concerned by my odd behavior i told them i was catching pokemon and they told me that i needed to stop in that area or at least in that manner because i was frightening the residents because i was just this really slow car driving around in circles for days i have not been back there since have not caught a dratini since but i do have a dragonite to show for it lol im glad the temptation to go back when the trespassing warning wears off is gone edit minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love it when i get to test a fresh program or system love it i will break that shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,in the right location it is pretty easy to get a cp dragonite in a week without a tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic will release their own tracker in the future will you be upset that happens
TheSilphRoad,removed,the first few days i had the game the three steps were a great way to give hotcold info for pkmn location since they got rid of it and its difficult or impossible to reach some areas in my city i feel like using trackers was fair also nearly every other player i came across used them too so it was a level playing field if they brought back the three steps id probably never look at the tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,michael
TheSilphRoad,removed,try tracking pokémon using the in game nearby system ive found it a lot of fun this is probably the biggest difference between you and i
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game is currently not as intended with the lack of a tracker prerelease meant to have a tracker i see the rise of third party trackers as a cause and effect of niantics blunder of their tracking system woes once niantic releases a tracker such as the hotcold distance system therell be less of an overall need to break the tos for feature that was originally advertised yes therell always be people who abuse the system theres never a catch rate for these things however me as well as a good majority of pogo players are unwilling to follow the rules especially when we dont agree with them
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would totally be against trackers if niantic would release an ingame tracking system that was both fun and functional
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes you are the only one you are a special snowflake
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes you are using trackers is not against the tos in a dictatorship its against the law to type an url into my browser and use the information there to my advantage nowhere else
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont want to have to use trackers it feels a little cheaty to find the exact location of pokemon but it feels boring to just walk around and hope you find something instead of hunting for them
TheSilphRoad,removed,considering how bare the game is outside of completing your dex who cares let everyone play the game the way they want do you think that if trackers never existed the game would be more fun for you it would be the same but with even fewer people still playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i originally was against trackers but my friend started using it when i was with him and holy crap did the game get more fun it went from walk and see what shows up maybe get lucky to holy crap man a growlithe is a quarter mile that way lets go get it it absolutely changed the game and for the better i havent ran this much in years i lost over lbs in months the trackers also made me understand the actual implementation of the gamewhich further pushes me toward the necessity for trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i think wasting weeks of time to get that last dratini is the opposite of fun im still playing and spending money on it if there had never been trackers i would have quit by mid august but i got snorlax exegguter and lapras without trackers those were from hatching eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use a tracker because my neighborhood is shitty enough that its legitimately unsafe for me to not know exactly where im going ill get my phone snatched or worse and no i dont have a car or the time to be driving to nice downtown areas to play i just want to know if an abras at the spawn point two blocks from me thats somehow still too far away to ever show on my nearby without wandering around this shitshow of a neighborhood all the time i get harassed enough just doing errands
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah one of my local stops turned into a gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,if youre against them dont use them simple dont hate on other people who dont have tons of free time to run circles around the city to find eevees edit also tracker users do not breach tos
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh daym i just read down below that medal are not cumultative why niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope its also without using bubblestrat otherwise there isnt much to be proud about
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would report the shit out of them
TheSilphRoad,removed,in other words im using these unless it is embedded into pokemon go so regardless what misgivings does ill be using a sighting system
TheSilphRoad,removed,apparently niantic has added a lot of obfuscation code to the game so our phones are working harder
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think what arkus is saying is that they are not publicly being used yet so dipshitbeavers point is moot
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah just like old times maybe the tracking system will come back too
TheSilphRoad,removed,urgh just as my defender bonus came to be ready literally working with a minute to go minute runs out and now i cant have them great when ive captured a number of gyms the last time this happened i lost out of all my gyms and bonuses
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am guessing niantic scaled down their number of servers but they got greedy and went too low
TheSilphRoad,removed,is the new tracker coming
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope theyre enabling trackers right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,safetynet is returning an error it looks like there is a large chance that googles safetynet servers went down stopping all android users from logging in putting too much load on the servers with failed requests that finally killed the whole thing
TheSilphRoad,removed,screwed my lucky egg session
TheSilphRoad,removed,because niantic screwed up somewhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,and of course we wont have any message from niantic explaining why
TheSilphRoad,removed,did anonymous take them out as fpm retribution
TheSilphRoad,removed,same problem in germany cant log in with google acc
TheSilphRoad,removed,im in but just noticed my battery is draining extreamly fast nowgreat
TheSilphRoad,removed,he might get only payouts per week now
TheSilphRoad,removed,because the last time it stopped working for me was because they killed access for all blackberry priv owners so i lost out for days worth of coins and playtime and thats only recently my gyms may not be still occupied you assume that i can just load the game and collect coins on the servers coming back up however for example if i now go to bed it being nearly and the servers resume in hours and the gym gets taken down between then and me waking up to click the claim option
TheSilphRoad,removed,any other company would release a social media post about why its down and for how long or even acknowledge it
TheSilphRoad,removed,its the scrapers faultwaitamoment
TheSilphRoad,removed,good to see that all the bot fighting and enhanced security updates have improved the stability of the servers s
TheSilphRoad,removed,and wait months to finally get it after opening multiple tickets
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe a response to the tracker sites breaking the new code they all announce be back up in the morning and a servers come down tinfoil hat is on
TheSilphRoad,removed,he makes way more money from youtube then niantic would be willing to pay him he would lose money working for them
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean the thing is there already is a basic speed stat for how fast a pokemon attacks based on the move itself so adding another formula for it to get put through shouldnt be that hard at all the fact they havent addressed it at all as well just points to them not caring about it and instead focusing on other aspects of their wildly popular game such as bottingspoofing and the pokemon tracking system as this caters to a wider crowd of their players which are mostly casual
TheSilphRoad,removed,hp lives matter
TheSilphRoad,removed,fastpokemapsse just to search specific little areas
TheSilphRoad,removed,lolol i was wondering if i was missing on anything valuable by not being part of this nest atlas but apparently its a gigantic joke ahah
TheSilphRoad,removed,i currently have a dream team that are all or capped and all iv vaporeon hydro water gun exeggutor confusion seed bomb arcanine bite flamethrower machamp chop stone edge blastoise bite ice beam jolteon bolt thunder
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup sorry about that also it is per time i win and with potions its about wins a minute apologies for whatever that gook was
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive hatched like eggs and no joke like of them have been electabuzz before i hatched the first i said to my fiancee i dont really care what it is as long as its not electabuzz fuck you electabuzz
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is fantastic news for all apple watch owners
TheSilphRoad,removed,apple users win again
TheSilphRoad,removed,a month ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here
TheSilphRoad,removed,wtf apple watch before android wear seriously
TheSilphRoad,removed,so niantic allow ressources for of their players of iphone users of them got a iwatch i dont hate appleniantic but what a waste when you see how buggyempty pogo atm
TheSilphRoad,removed,but where is my update neintic
TheSilphRoad,removed,what are you using to generate the heat map
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was gifted an apple watch about a year ago use it every day im pretty surprised this came out myself feeling pretty lucky right now haha itd be kick ass if they use the watchs much more accurate movement tracker for eggs my watch registers around km while pogo registers around on a walk but im not holding my breath it still looks hella convenient
TheSilphRoad,removed,short for metapod
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks i didnt know that end sarcasm
TheSilphRoad,removed,wherehow did you generate this heat map
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use my arcanine too most of the snorlax i dodge because one in my neighbourhood has hyperbeam
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they dont have android wear support someone is getting murdered
TheSilphRoad,removed,are they still here i though they figured it out and quit already
TheSilphRoad,removed,your buddy pokémon will appear alongside your trainer avatar on your profile screen and reward you with helpful bonuses—including candy sweet jesus reading that got me concerned if i walk and pogo kms at that with a lapras and get a friggin potion or something else instead of a candy i will be absolutely livid
TheSilphRoad,removed,please please please do not screw this up niantic we really need a good update this time around the idea is good it seems to make sense from a design point of view and for balance too lets not make the buddy feature a roulette with only a chance of getting candies please niantic do not
TheSilphRoad,removed,they are a bunch of amateurs running the worlds biggest game app its like a joke they need to bring in a team of professionals fairly quickly
TheSilphRoad,removed,its probably just a bit of exp and stardust although we can always hope for passive abilities
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly what in was thinking the apple watch essentially flopped for obvious reasons pogo is phenomenally popular why not take something thats not selling well and link it to something thats raking in cash
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wonder if one of the exciting additions is giving a decent tracking system back
TheSilphRoad,removed,the buddy feature makes for a nice distraction for niantic to release another update without fixing the tracking system
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup features that where alluded to early in the release have seemingly fallen completely out of niantics radar weve actually lost features imo trading pvp battling improved tracking this one annoys me the most because we had this feature and it worked early on then it broke then they pulled it completely then released a new version but only for residents of sf why isnt fixing this at the top of their list pokemon go plus im including this because it was delayed and we still have not been given a solid release date why the watch app and the buddy system are priorities for niantic really irks me considering where we started
TheSilphRoad,removed,im really hoping they are not making the mistake of talking about stuff that isnt going to be released anytime soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,hopefully means the buddy could improve their ivs or moves not the depressing possibility of candy roulette
TheSilphRoad,removed,remember when pokemon go plus was coming out on july anyone guys
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont care about candy i need stardust
TheSilphRoad,removed,this
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think drowning in money may have made them reassess their priorities
TheSilphRoad,removed,this isnt anything new and it was confirmed just as much on september on httpwwwpokemongolivecomenpostbuddy the official site the next addition to pokémon go will be buddy pokémon you will be able to pick your favorite pokémon from your collection to become your buddy opening up unique ingame rewards and experiences buddy pokémon will appear alongside your trainer avatar on your profile screen adding helpful bonuses such as awarding candy for walking together youll also have the ability to change your buddy pokémon at any time they mention unique rewards and also mention candy soon after such as implies more than just candy nothing new confirmed aside from the apple bs which i dont use any of their products so doesnt interest me at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,im just going to guess because of the apple thing and this being a short week they will delay the patch weeks
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok but where is the update ffs
TheSilphRoad,removed,im worried about the in game experiences
TheSilphRoad,removed,am i the only one reading this as the buddy system is a new pokestop with the chance of getting candies chance candy stardust chance potion revive
TheSilphRoad,removed,as pokemon go continues to grow haha now youre taking the piss niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,wouldnt exactly call this a psa its more of a tip
TheSilphRoad,removed,take a picture of themtheir car and post it to the local pogo facebook page if you have one if theyre gonna be asses the people theyre playing around have the right to know and avoid them
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah you guys can just run a gps spoofer or whatever android users are doingdont worry bruh 🐩
TheSilphRoad,removed,we got the update that buddy system was confirmed so with niantic i wouldnt doubt the update to come two weeks from now step forward steps back in typical niantic fashion
TheSilphRoad,removed,san fran only for testing well get it soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,you really couldnt set it on a table
TheSilphRoad,removed,im terrified they are gonna ruin this concept before they even release it
TheSilphRoad,removed,your first statement there has been massive testing on the naming eevee trick and its had a success rate percent so eevee evolutions are far from random if you dont what im talking about then google it but if you change the name of your eevee to rainervaporeon sparkyjolteon and pyroflareon this works of the time
TheSilphRoad,removed,f uck
TheSilphRoad,removed,a service that flys your characte there to catch it for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is that twitter exactly how did you find it
TheSilphRoad,removed,its probably best for the future of this twitter if it stays low profile dont let yourself be the reason it gets shut down interesting analysis though
TheSilphRoad,removed,if niantic knows a shred of lore is that all youre basing this on no going to happen at all this is almost as bad as those videos that are like i caught mewtwo dont pull this shit its wishful speculation based on nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,no evil cant win so if you are hopeless it is your problem i really dream that spoofers will get banned asap
TheSilphRoad,removed,if someone feels like tinfoiling and trying to decode this jumbled mess feel free httpimgurcomakamdo
TheSilphRoad,removed,definitely
TheSilphRoad,removed,suggestion dont leave it near your dog its also a small dent so ill have to say your posting for points thats what a lot of people do want to be a real community member then stop posting crap
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep im done catching anything unless its a snorlaxchansey and im inside theres nothing to do in the game until niantic adds suitable content
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly id rather have actual legitimate real battling between friends before gen but yeah i agree as much as i love this idea of real world gaming and pokémon the lackluster delivery here is increasing my boredom exponentially as time goes on
TheSilphRoad,removed,multipost
TheSilphRoad,removed,back to rpokemon go with the common sense garbage
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would love battling if it wad the impetus to scrap the godawful combat system as is pvp would be the contest of the connections whoever lags less winds pokemon would be irrelevant
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes theres still no content and after learning that eggs are linked to pokestops ive basically given up on completing the dex
TheSilphRoad,removed,im very bored with it as a game i play it on autopilot now with the pogo plus farming stardust for future updates i havent bothered with gyms because every gym in the city is a maxed out level mystics as a mystic i cant even interact with the gyms due to them being clogged i am really hoping they make major changes to the combat system they need to balance everything just drop the current tap and dodge system and add pvp that would breathe a lot of life into the game trading will be fantastic too
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes i was getting bored and was only playing because i was addicted so decided to delete the game and wait for more content i am hoping a break would renew my interest and new content would make the game fun again
TheSilphRoad,removed,we all have the same game thats a bold statement
TheSilphRoad,removed,op you sound a lot like me i have the same frustrations and also a lv player whose been playing with my gf since the game was released so many issues are killing this game for me but my number issue thats pushing me the most to quitting is the absurdly high amount of unchecked cheaters that niantic allow to run rampage
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been frequently been below zero and wave after wave of snow storms has been pummeling my city that only had enough funding to plow the major roads slowly because this amount of snow hasnt hit these parts for over years and the winter has just begun foo what you talkin bout stayin im snowed into suburbia im already gone havent played this game since november
TheSilphRoad,removed,should
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah agree with pretty much everything you said i am just at an awe with this game sometimes my biggest gripe is they are trying to shove more pokemon in our face rather than implementing what would make this game better where are legendary pokes where is poke trading where is pvp how hasnt there been true log in rewards yet day streak is garbage a bit more xp and stardust means nothing to me long term i personally havent really gotten into gyms yet when i did fight for gyms though there was no mechanic of mass healing i should be able to click on my revive then select revive all pokes not click each one individually same thing with potions lastly a selling items feature to increase stardust im not asking for stardust im saying like stardust per item depending on its rarity
TheSilphRoad,removed,or just play hey monster and give niantic and nintendo the finger
TheSilphRoad,removed,i heard they give you lucky eggs at level too wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,its pretty embarassing how they can tweak some numbers in the code and call that an event because they really havent done much for these i suspect that they know this and have been playing catchup and will actually give us something with substance for easter however if niantic chooses to listen to rpokemongo and sees the fan boys just ecstatically praising that they were finally able to evolve their charizard they are going to keep releasing crap that just makes the game easier then those same people will complete their dex and quit the game because what keeps them entertained and what they want are not the same thing
TheSilphRoad,removed,they just dont want to expose the population to niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,you do realize the op used the exact same ivs for the attacking pokemon right did you even read the post
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sure this will get downvoted but bla bla bla bla bla
TheSilphRoad,removed,onix anal beads
TheSilphRoad,removed,great post with sound reasoning and logic the highlight for sure is the scaling of xp and candy you absolutely should get more xp for evolving a pokemon that cost or candies to evolve than candy ones encountering a of evolution mon should be a welcome sight because you know the reward is worth the effortresources to catch it you were spot on with this take it a step further and up the transfer reward a little bit receiving candy for a high cp or evolved pokemon feels too much like a rip off the grind should be expected but after getting xp to reach level the reward of ultra hyper pots revives and razz seems harsh i would understand if those items were purchasable but thats not even the case sadly idk how much they can do about it because if they did increase level rewards then it would be a slap in the face to those who grinded to even higher levels the area where i think you got a little fuzzy was with the meta i was shocked when niantic did their first balancing update seriously shocked i thought gym battles would be the last thing on their list but it really does become an integral part of the game once you get into the higher levels and it is nice to know they keep an eye on it with that said i would rather them focus their efforts on solidifying the current system as oppose to making whole sale changes minor tweaks that could make gym battles better the camera angle needs to be pulled back a bit if you use a big attacker it feels even more claustrophobic your pokemon should never be off screen either no matter how much you are spamming dodge gym sniping should not be a thing if you used revives and potions to take that sucker down you get first claim no brainer this might be controversial but some people argue how real time battles arent true to the pokemon spirit but is gang banging a gym true to it either we all know the inherent advantage attackers have at the very least multiple attackers should be limited to the same team and the amount of available attacking slots should scale with the prestige level of the gym i understand level and above gyms requiring a team up but gym battles were always a duel not a gang fight you out gym conquering with your team valor friends one night send your best teammate forward to try and take it down for you guys to place defenders make it a little more nuanced than just brute force my last cents is about rng its a gift and a curse trainers unfamiliar with the concept got a crash course the longer they played whether it was encountering low level evolution pokemon in the wild getting shafted with egg hatches poor ivs or the worst possible moveset for me getting a bad moveset is probably the most egregious of all the rng in this game grinding those candies getting incrementally higher cp form pokemon and pouring over ivs only to get a terrible movest is a tough pill to swallow especially since evolving to assemble your squad is a huge part of the end game weirdly enough the solution is to give us an extra opportunity to play the rng no matter the stardust or candy cost allow us to reroll our pokemons moveset time per pokemon let us have that second chance before we restart the grind to evolve another one if we are being greedy let us either pay the price with worse moves or the chance at the jack pot
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a good feature for people who dont understand how pokemons can generate candies without going into the grinder understand that its a japanese concept call ikizukuri its potentially nsfl for some vegetarians beginning at in the video
TheSilphRoad,removed,say hello gps spoofer free candies p
TheSilphRoad,removed,its so frustrating that we all know how great this game could be but it seems like niantic just as contradictory motivations i wish nintendo would just take the reigns and get someone else niantic has been screwing up this game so badly i cant believe how sick everyone i know is of this game already i remember week one as we all played together i thought this would be one of the most promising and revolutionary things id get to experience everything that niantic has done since has only made the game more boringfrustrating and everyone kinda just wants to forget about it now im still holding onto hope but i havent really played for months
TheSilphRoad,removed,deeznuts
TheSilphRoad,removed,i remember the time i sniped a gym with my shitty slowpoke ended up with zero hp like minutes later
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah yes i can see how this research helps us learn more about pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,fairly plain feature to implement i was under the impression this was an open forum dilweed
TheSilphRoad,removed,haha speak for yourself most people here have yet to see a single one of those rares
TheSilphRoad,removed,and yet people were mad when niantic shut down the tracking sites that showed you exactly where pokemon were all over the world
TheSilphRoad,removed,im just considering quitting i live in suburban during this km i can only catch a pidgey or weedle and thats only maybe so there is no need for me to have the app open if i cant even hatch the eggs effectively why bother
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes it has worsened again why cant we have nice things
TheSilphRoad,removed,it could be all of that stuff except not completely unrewarding and boring
TheSilphRoad,removed,studyin mad balls rn
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah this just happened to me today i figured i must have just fucked up and powered up the wrong jinx but this is definitely what occurred now i know i will avoid it but there is no fixing the first time it happens there is no way this should have happened and is definitely a bug
TheSilphRoad,removed,how is this game still getting worse
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are starters
TheSilphRoad,removed,im afraid this is the end i drive my kids around i have ms so it was great quality time spent together actually had a trip planned this weekend revolving around pokegonot sure that is going to happen i wasnt happy with many changes but we barreled through them and kept it up now this is the straw that has reduced plus hours of playing literally to minutes soon will not be worth it driving through our neighborhoods for my kids to spot something good has ended
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know that the mph is related to potential liability from people crashing into things in their car while playing pokemon go you can do a lot of damage crashing a car at mph i think it has to do with niantics completely unrealistic view that to play pokemon go you should be on foot not driving not biking not riding in a vehicle be in a city
TheSilphRoad,removed,likely to hinder scanners but ultimately they will work around that and everyone else suffers
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have nothing against passengers playing the game is hardly fair atm since location is a huge factor im just giving a reason why niantic might have made this choice spawn points removed were in an area open to the public the players were the ones causing damages nuisances etc yet niantic is held responsible cause they placed the spawn points there niantic put this spawn point near a road and causes a potentially dangerous situation if someone plays pogo while driving and gets distracted by the spawn pointthe person should be held responsible for any damages caused since it was their choice but is this legally the case not sure about the answer and it could even differ per country
TheSilphRoad,removed,can still do it dude
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know what the most ridiculous part is if they are now tracking our speed in almost real time how come eggs are still on minute timers and dont register all the distance
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly speaking yes i rely heavily on public transportation to play this game if the game stops tracking distance and showing spawns theres pretty much nothing left in it for me now given that winter is right by the corner theres no way i would look for pokemon in two feet deep snow all i ask from this game now is just let me complete the pokedex so that i can quit without a regret
TheSilphRoad,removed,no im a single mom of two small children so i am never a passenger nor can i ride my bike for any good distance it will affect me positively if one of the people butthurt about buying pogo to drive recklessly gives me theirs
TheSilphRoad,removed,whining about down votes hilarious
TheSilphRoad,removed,it does go against the spirit of the game but the game has changed niantic should try to mold the game into something their customers want i pick up mons to and from work in hours today i had to go to the park to get my fix i caught in minutes i wont do that again
TheSilphRoad,removed,youve subscribed to pokémon go facts enjoy inventory full you can delete potions balls revives incenses and lucky eggs to make room
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh snap🔥🔥
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only good thing i can take away from this is that i no longer have to buy balls because now i can only catch pokemon in the places i farm stops for balls so ill never run out again like i was prior to this change jokes on you niantic you just lost a week
TheSilphRoad,removed,i add seconds for me sitting there fuming at the terrible game design that makes me choose pokemon to train at a one pokemon gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,itt op salty af somebadeh call the wahwahwahmbulance
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantics obsession with defeating spoofers is killing the game not spoofers
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow was a study really necessary to figure this out
TheSilphRoad,removed,i swear its doing that on purpose now
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game knows if a pokemon will be caught will break out or will flee since the moment the pokeball touches the pokemon you can see this with the snorlax xposed module
TheSilphRoad,removed,but the bot hacker are working hard on breaking it again
TheSilphRoad,removed,because this place is awash with salt not as bad as rpokemongo but still loads of salt in here
TheSilphRoad,removed,should assume the worst because niantic likes to screw their own game
TheSilphRoad,removed,oops we have destroyed our game that you got playing before we ruined it
TheSilphRoad,removed,so you had no skill we got it move along
TheSilphRoad,removed,this its a nice work indeed i have thought something similar myself till i found one app in the appstore ios user here that do that for yourself its called pokepsy and really worth it it localice where u r and let u know wich spawn point you have near and wich one of them are active with one pokemon already in it and wich one its inactive they even have a timer that let you know whether how much time you have left for catching the pokemon or how much for a pokemon to appear its absolutely legal and free so it worth a try¡ i dont have economy interest on the app i promise jajaja
TheSilphRoad,removed,very irritating indeed
TheSilphRoad,removed,give it a rest its fine here
TheSilphRoad,removed,i did this at my work and at a local nest i mapped out all of the spawn points times and durations within view from my desk and everywhere in the park because the park was a stable charmander nest for the first three migrations then the spawn points changed they added some the spawn times changed on others and the charmander left the park i havent bothered making out my work again its very disheartening to have that work turned useless
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know if this is common knowledge sadly i think this was fairly common knowledge and practice before scanner use became so prevalent
TheSilphRoad,removed,very strange oukitels are afaik properly licensed ctsed by google they also come with unrooted stock roms fpm reported that obfuscation is now done in a way that worsens the battery drain which is so bad that its able to use up a fresh fully charged note battery in less than hours and it has a tendency to permanently damage batteries probably by going over their design power limits now a phone company comes out with extralargebatteried phones and niantic promptly blocks those phones from playing sounds like the extreme battery drain is not a bug its a weaponized feature designed to provide a selling point for pogo niantic please stop playing dirty
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would ask him how he would feel to go into a grocery store when he is extremely hungry but all the aisles are not labeled he only has minutes to find a chicken sandwich and he cant run no chicken sandwich tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes please im sick of being the only one on mystic in my area and walking by level instinct gyms and one single valor level gym hang in there guys ive taken down three level gyms by myself and it always takes over an hour by myself just to have instinct reclaim it by the end of the day enough with this terrible team system everyone knows its broken as shit if you dont have a lot of players on each team just give me some form of pve like pokemon trainers in the game that you can fight once a day or whatever to give me money when i beat them and not make it such a me vs everyone else i see playing game
TheSilphRoad,removed,trackers are down and youre not using your ultra balls so now that you are stocking them you feel that they are more readily available tldr trackers down no snorlax to catch accumulate ultra balls
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have no interest in any plan that involves niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,that would be super effective you might wanna suggest it somewhere where niantic has a better chance of seeing it though httpswwwredditcomrpokemongo probably has more official eyeballs on it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i caught lvl dratiniless than but i powered him up to my max now lol also seel and goldeen but got the worst moveset sometimes i wonder how many i actually had before transferred without checkingbecause it had low cp or something im glad theres no way to know now that theyre gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic should but they obviously wont
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually they stopped bots this waytoo the fastpokemap hacker works together with bot developers
TheSilphRoad,removed,then if theyre listening they should know players want demn trackers and maps i think the appraisal was made because too many of the players used pogoadvisor and such website but still it will take a while before its implemented i hope theyll release first legendaries before trading id rather see trading at than at maybe itll make more players come back to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,aww im sorry do you also throw dozens of balls at level zubats and then get sad i live in a suburb of houston the largest city in the us lol my immediate neighborhood has dozens of spawns but only pokestops and a gym i just personally play extremely casually and like to pretend im years old again and limit myself to just my neighborhood i decided months ago that spending gas money on this game was silly i was playing against a couple in their and a dude in his in their cars who were having a great time smiling and waving at me no white knights needed here ok
TheSilphRoad,removed,neeeerds jk thats awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait until niantic adds trading and finish your pokedex legitimately uhhhh what by then the internet will be like the ham radio outdated niche technology used by a few geeks we cant all wait years some of us are already old
TheSilphRoad,removed,why did i have to complete a captcha getting really tired of all these needless question marks
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,lack of tracking crashes when browsing pokemon gym errors i can live with all of these issues but its stuff like this that really grinds my gears captcha driving warnings disappearing sightings lists when traveling fast its all the same this is the exact same approach that the musicmovie industry uses to combat piracy the implement things like drm and antipiracy ads and warnings that cannot be skipped all of which only hurt the legitimate consumers and do nothing to combat piracy its basically a stop and frisk law for gamers f those guys for implementing this kind of trash
TheSilphRoad,removed,that might keep players coming back for the night
TheSilphRoad,removed,the problem is simple give us a real tracking system not the guessing game of something is near you or the supposed system that sf has that just says go to this stop or gym for something that will cut the use of trackers down by over half now the people who not that is just something you cant fix till you can ban them all and they get bored of playing the game from a chair people have already begun work and reversing all the things in the way for the frackers to work give people an actual tracker not a guessing game or a memory game of where each spawn point is with in of you
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not that people dont realize the issues that tracking websites have on niantic its that party sites shouldnt have to resort to making a tracker that niantic should of in the first place
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they do make legendaries and dittos available to catch and one ran on me id kidnap john hanke and make a lampshade out of his skin
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats exactly the problem the proper way to stop the bottingscanners is one that doesnt impact the legit players anything else is unacceptable stop and frisk is not right even if they find drugsweapons on the person that said all of the changes they made to stop the map scanners at the cost of game performance will be futile in the end those sites will all come back and the biggest losers are all the people that can no longer play the game because those performance issues made the game unplayable on their older devices
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont listen to that predator guy his logic is poor and yours is sound discussions like this are great for helping all trainers
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,i live in the suburbs of a major city i am minutes from downtown i can see stops and gyms from my house this game was designed for city dwellers and the rest of us are just being strung along
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow this guy sso giff him medal and when you said bam i was about to my pants his forseeing skills are generational or did he get struck by a lightning to have them
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i called it too but im a woman so im always right
TheSilphRoad,removed,if there is a stop in range you better make your work to it gotta keep up that sponsorship revenue no stops do what you want
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow this is new for everybody here great that you are the person to make screenshots likw that
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you want to do this keep out of your account for at least day before and after to avoid being labeled as a spoofer i did the same when i was on vacation with my girlfriend where she had no internet access to catch a scyther from the local nest there logged on with her account for a minute and then left none of us got banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,the silph road is now helping cheaters with advice nice stay classy
TheSilphRoad,removed,stfu moron
TheSilphRoad,removed,what art thee smoking
TheSilphRoad,removed,except that you wouldnt be forced to see sponsored pokestops that way well see but id expect niantic would make sure not to lose any ingame add revenue potential before implementing an actual choice for players
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i am talking about others who developed exactly the same feature before like wwwpoketraqcom and stuff like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,will not happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,just spoof location
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am definitely not dumb the problem is that while you link a screenshot you have no accompanying evidence that supports your claim of this guygirlother person being a cheater it is exactly why this is a witchhunt instead of an actual report as you dont have any proof that you show that you truly were alone with no one within gpsrange of that stop it is nothing more than you calling someone out i dont know where this stop is i dont know what situation it is no one does except you so unless you provide that information this isnt more than an ordinary attempt to defame someone
TheSilphRoad,removed,cry me a river play something else if you dont like it
TheSilphRoad,removed,called my friend out on this and told him to send me a screenshot of his kangaskhan httpimgurcomcwlnkly was expecting him to have candy so i can laugh at his face and call him a cheater the kinda threw me off but is he a genius cheater who spoofed of them to cover his tracks or did he really hatch from an egg we are in na btw
TheSilphRoad,removed,fcking disgusting that they keep releasing in more countries before fixing the game where they already are greedy as fck
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah the old reddit you know people look at the internet and see everyone talking about harambe and some just dont understand why does everyone love this gorilla no one knew who he was before he was brutally murdered you know why i loved harambe so much and i still do to this day let me tell you i live near the cincinnati zoo and ive gone there many many times the first time i could remember going was when i was a wee lad about the age of we arrived at the zoo and saw some animals many creatures snakes sloths birds lions tigers giraffes elephants etc then we saw him the gorilla harambe as a little kid i remember gazing on him and thinking wow look at that gorilla hes beautiful and then he turned around and faced me and thats when i saw it his giant mega sized big black helmet i was breathless i desired it i needed it skip forward a year i am now and we go back to the zoo all day im yelling at my family to hurry up cause i want to see harambe they didnt quite understand why i wanted to see him so bad but i knew they just wouldnt understand so i wouldnt tell them it was around pm and the sun was beating down on us it was so hot we finally reached harambes home and i was just staring at him he looked at me and i was so happy then something crazy happened his giant big black helmet got bigger and harder it was amazing i couldnt believe my eyes and what i was witnessing i started to drool and i didnt understand why but when he looked at me i knew we connected somehow i am now and we visited the zoo again and we eventually got to the exhibit and i just couldnt wait to see him and his big black helmet i saw him and he saw me we glanced at each other once more and there it started to grow he ran towards me but hit the glass then he started to try and sensationally touch the wall thinking of me i was honored i couldnt believe i had been so lucky to have harambe love me and desire me i wanted to pleasure him but i didnt know how i never saw harambe after that day but i thought about him every night and then it happened that black night owl kid did what i wish i could have jumped into his cage i can only imagine what that kid experienced and how happy he was what happened next i cant even type without crying harambe was playing with the child and having a good time but because of the kids black fatass mother they opened fire on harambae why harambe did nothing wrong harambe was then protecting the child from the gunshots harambe died saving the childs life they killed the love of my life my idol my everything harambe was so attractive and had the nicest helmet i only wish i saw him more i miss him so much out of respect for what he did for me and what he showed me when i was dicks out for harambe
TheSilphRoad,removed,please remove this fakeass post
TheSilphRoad,removed,your post history just screams give me attention please as does your social media but i will humor you provide screenshots of your mr mime along with your trainer profile with the jogger and breeder badges clearly visible provide a screenshot of mr mime in your pokedex as well as its specific entry
TheSilphRoad,removed,go radar works perfectly on the app store as of now
TheSilphRoad,removed,this seems really unlikely i am going to have to request some proof haha just kidding youre a spoofer and not a very bright one httpiimgurcomzpdbyhfpng
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for the time waste
TheSilphRoad,removed,saving this here for future wall of shame material httpiimgurcomzpdbyhfpng
TheSilphRoad,removed,one day you will wake up and find everything all ur stats reset to and theres absolutely nothing you can do about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,access codes to see your site sounds worse than niantic have a nice day
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok dad
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive done this it doesnt work
TheSilphRoad,removed,welp any other alternatives for ios
TheSilphRoad,removed,hail hydra
TheSilphRoad,removed,wtf well ive already stopped going out to play this game due to a lack of tracking this is pretty much the nail in the coffin for me theres one last tracking service available that i know of that is still up and running which i use its fairly slow but can be reliable i guess when that goes down like the rest of the map trackers ill be done with this game really was fun while it lasted guys what a shame
TheSilphRoad,removed,wellso do we have any other alternative to make this game playable
TheSilphRoad,removed,until devs found how to use the new api
TheSilphRoad,removed,were just about due for another update if theyre managing to keep the goal of weekly updates fingers crossed but breath not held for a tracking system
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah cool it didnt sound like it would be a quick fix initially is there somewhere i can follow their progress
TheSilphRoad,removed,are there alternatives to the service that maybe someone could pm me
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is absolutely terrible for forcing these sites to shut down i didnt think them cracking down on party tracking apps was a big deal until last night when a snorlax which i dont have yet appeared in my nearby tab thanks to niantic i had no way to find it in the game or using other apps so i dangerously sped up and down random streets hoping to find it before it was too late i failed to find it
TheSilphRoad,removed,anybody know what we should use now
TheSilphRoad,removed,you mean stumbling blindly through the city with no hopes of ever getting anything good for all you know a mewtwo could be meters to your left but you will never encounter it because that tracking thing is worthless
TheSilphRoad,removed,soare there any others still up yknow for science
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is starting to be that bully
TheSilphRoad,removed,which pokemon go map would this be link anyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokeadvisor is accurate what you see on the screen is your pokemon exact ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,there was an area that was close to me that always spawned bulbasaur all hours of the day usually would spawn at a time in different places it was awesome now all of those spawn points were replaced with ratatta i have one tracking map that hasnt received the ban hammer yet and can confirm that everything is a ratatta now so thats why its now a nest because theres basically more ratatta spawns than there was before in that area
TheSilphRoad,removed,best answer
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really like to know how geo blocking regions enable safety effected to traffic
TheSilphRoad,removed,have you considered doing this for any other cities it looks amazing
TheSilphRoad,removed,revives lol have fun trying to take down high level gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,macedonia already had pokemon go since months now when greece got it now fyrom i have no idea about
TheSilphRoad,removed,have you added the spawnpoints automatically or manually how exactly did u do it i have data for my hometown and i hope i can create a map like this without having to enter everything manually because that will take some time d
TheSilphRoad,removed,they said theyre not doing that did you lose access to account behind it
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was recently prestiging a gym and i lost a few times cause i didnt dodge well enough after losing i noticed that the battles won counter went up for the first mon in the gym that i had been battling
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah true i guess not sure why someone downvotes you but people upvote the other dude talkin shit lol smh reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,when will it be released today
TheSilphRoad,removed,he never said he wanted to kill all lapras
TheSilphRoad,removed,whwhoa thats some of the best click bait ive ever seen your ideas best quality is its absence of consideration for snorlaxs feelings its information tables are great too its definitely got some good stats definitely thats what i think see ya
TheSilphRoad,removed,use pgnexus to get real iv
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh man youre so funny almost as funny as the time your parents almost used the coat hanger on you they really only have the one regret though they with they had
TheSilphRoad,removed,is this subreddit seriously becoming as shitty as rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,i thought it was just a way to let us make penis jokes
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you even know what a meta is
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,in most pokemon games its even more difficult to get a good pokemon in most games you need to get all these which arent explained in game nature personality ivs egg moves ev training right move set all of these arent explained in the game itself you have to research all of them using spreadsheets and figuring it out we only have to deal with ivs here for those of us that played competitive pokemon this game is simplistic to the point of babying us
TheSilphRoad,removed,no problem i also dislike the proposal because it falls under both the more free shit and the make the game easier catergories however the feature itself just not the proposed rewards is interesting also games need to reward winners more than losers fundamental game design the game already rewards coins for gyms this is winners getting rewards and awarding additional resources do you have a problem with this the real issue is in the size of the bonus
TheSilphRoad,removed,think about the resurgence of players when they do their first major update such as legendary birds mew etc or when they revamp the gym system or when they bring more pokemon to rural areas the sightings tab is too damn empty or in a long while from now when they release more pokemon or trading or player battles etc im playing now because i know if i stopped playing now id pick up the game again in the future inevitably so i might as well have a leg up on the competition
TheSilphRoad,removed,rmoderatelyinteresting
TheSilphRoad,removed,she seems almost robotic to me
TheSilphRoad,removed,my kinda lady
TheSilphRoad,removed,aurora colorado movie theater lure run
TheSilphRoad,removed,not picking a team is pretty much putting a sign out that says this trainer for sale
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude you are way under estimating people and no not every one talk and communicate search on the net see what is like in melbourne right now where i live people have been literally sitting outside of state library with pokestop and just stare at their phones for hours a day since day they do not communicate it is very different to what you are talking about
TheSilphRoad,removed,crabtree lake off of near umstead park is a hotbead for magikarpslopokepsyduck theres a pokestop near the old reedy creek entrance that if you throw a lure on you can reel em in pretty well ive found three dratini and two dragonair right across the entrance in the park proper would highly suggest looking for pokestops near any lakestate park and try a lure to see if you can replicate
TheSilphRoad,removed,okay httpimgurcomamcbaw luckily unluckily i got a sandshrew today from an egg so i actually could do a test on this to confirm i maxed out the regular caught sandshrew which ended up at i then started levelling his eggy brother and he hit well before he maxed out the question is now how trainer level can effect this does this eggmon advantage stay all the way through level or whatever and can it vary from eggmon to eggmon
TheSilphRoad,removed,eevees fucking love whataburger i caught in the drive thru line sat
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats what theyre saying i think we all agree we want to be able to actually go out and explore to catch your pokemon but when going out to explore means driving to a completely different state or just being massive inconvenience in order to get a certain pokemon i think thats a bit of a problem i only speak for myself though
TheSilphRoad,removed,how are you doing it mind pming that link
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank fuck i drove minutes away so i could go wreck like gyms in one location while this was going on couldnt beat a single one because of this bug glad to see they are paying attention to things like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah much more stable and seems faster as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i mean if you really think about it almost all males can
TheSilphRoad,removed,with the amount of money theyre making or have made quality updates shouldnt take them very long
TheSilphRoad,removed,gold the colour of showers
TheSilphRoad,removed,from my experience reporting is useless source reported various spoofers including info etc they are all still there
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope your boss tells you that at some point
TheSilphRoad,removed,screw china shady fs dont want the game because itll expose government secrets bahaha
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think youre wrong af
TheSilphRoad,removed,pgnexusgg already fetches data so it should be very possibly to create something like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,because niantic dont know what theyre doing in regards to anything pokemon related
TheSilphRoad,removed,got a pidge and a zubat i mean better than nothing and i would have powered them up if the had gotten good movesets but man finding anything else above in the wild is so fucking hard now
TheSilphRoad,removed,this doesnt really make sense bearing this out theyd have to fight in one of your gyms wasting their resources to create a slot in order to put a shitty pokemon in it theyd spend less resources just kicking you out of it and they wont even be the ones to benefit from it go ahead and let them do this its pointless and wastes far more of their resources than it will yours
TheSilphRoad,removed,if i were to to play a word association game with this thread my responses would be circle cookie fluff rim salad juggle throat
TheSilphRoad,removed,unfortunately niantic wants to dumb down training so that average noob can do it was at the park the other day a lvl kid didnt even know how it works
TheSilphRoad,removed,i never said he did the definition of clickbait as you seem to need it content especially that of a sensational or provocative nature whose main purpose is to attract attention and draw visitors to a particular web page
TheSilphRoad,removed,gotten keep out them pokémon kids since you own the whole godddam parking lot have fun in your parking lot lord parking
TheSilphRoad,removed,the tracking system is so broken you have to apply trigonometry for it to work right there has to be a more simple way for us to implement tracking just give us an arrow pointing in the direction of the pokemon or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are many methods that one could similar to this the problem with all of them this is not fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,but theyre not click bate as far as what the titles are
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank you
TheSilphRoad,removed,the sighted system is still bullshit and laggy i cant believe people find it fun tracking something that disappears after minutes
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait youre telling me there is an actual way to find pokemon without a tracker pinpointing the exact location oh god better dont tell rpokemongo dont want to burst their bubble
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you were triangulating yes but with that you had a decent chance to scout the area by simply covering it by walking since the area needed to be searched quickly decreases if you get closer and well if its really in an inaccessible area there isnt much to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,nick is the most presentable and reliable source of information about pokemon go unlike that fat dude reversal who is boring and most of the people that watches his videos are just waiting for the giveaway lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill just scan
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know this isnt intended but this seems like a troll post
TheSilphRoad,removed,feels like
TheSilphRoad,removed,two years from now when we finally have a working tracking system looking back at such posts would be hilarious for now its just sad
TheSilphRoad,removed,they wouldnt would they yeah they would
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i had this problem too but much worse with pokeballs i ran out of balls in a rural area and couldnt refill due to the lack of pokestops so i wanted to buy balls for bucks but accidentially bought them twice and lost coins im really surprised how many basic programming erros are made when the game was programmed this and the gym memormy leak are just two examples i just started to learn java but maybe im already a better programmer than the niantic programmers xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,the main reason im still playing is for an update like this i dont want gen until pogo has more traditional pokemon features
TheSilphRoad,removed,should have just coded it to have a timeout and manual retry if the purchase fails automatically resending purchase requests through is terrible programming
TheSilphRoad,removed,to this horribly written summary of what everyone already knows they want
TheSilphRoad,removed,so instead of wandering around randomly we now have to solve maths problems to catch pokemon great idea op do we submit our tests to you for marking as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol orrr just use one of the many tracking apps out there
TheSilphRoad,removed,awesome indeed ive gotten a lot of help from uhomu and others if game press would like to integrate some examples of how you can sneak in moves before you have to dodge feel free to use httpspokebattlercom for example at a particular fight im looking at now you can do exactly confusions before the earliest possible hydro pump dodge
TheSilphRoad,removed,this some bs i and a group of friends had a trip planned this weekend to a charmander nest in alt about hours away we have a car rental reserved and everything and then this bs f u niantic dont punish us legit players because others are cheating i mean less than weeks and a new migration like wtf im done with this bs
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wrote a script to find these ill post it in the appropriate subreddit when i get the chance
TheSilphRoad,removed,its cool that niantic didnt like how the old tracker panned out its cool that they want to push the game in a different direction its cool that its taking awhile to figure out its not cool that theyve removed the in game alternative in the meantime while simultaneously targeting all third party workarounds without a peep about progress or direction for the new tracker in months throw us a bone niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,this isnt really a good excuse though they seemed to be able to spit out the sf exclusive tracker pretty quickly theres no reason why it should be taking this long to change tracking if theyre still planning on doing so
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry we disappointed you unique unicorn
TheSilphRoad,removed,those from rpokemongo also visit this sub and they are particularly interested in any discussion about trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like your post that only says good riddance quality post i commend you for drawing our attention to the lack of reddiquette in your own comment posts here here good sir youre doing gods work
TheSilphRoad,removed,diiieeee
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been too long without proper tracking scanners have been the sole reason to play for many and obviously theyll complain and niantic does pretty much nothing new every patch oh and id like to add one thing you mentioned the pleasure in seeing that rare hatch or suddenly appear how can i be sure that something appears when i go out hunting if i dont get anything but common trash its been pretty much a waste of time ive done these commoncatching walks multiple times and that was when the game released
TheSilphRoad,removed,can a dragonite beat a cp dragonite
TheSilphRoad,removed,until last week when niantic added more spawn points there were spawn points total within of my house the first one is across the street from my house the starting point the second was the intersection at the end of the street to the left the third was slightly up the next street it takes around minutes to walk from my house to the farthest spawn point which is the big spawn zone that can spawn up to pokemon at once so one day a jigglypuff shows up cool not a weedle walk to the end of the street i am walking directly at the spawn zone and am halfway down the street the jigglypuff disappears aw man must have despawned well theres still a bellsprout on the tracker ill just catch that get to the end of the street it pops back onto the tracker keep walking around the corner gone again get to the spawn point bellsprout and jigglypuff are there a couple weeks later there was i think a horsea and oddish i want both of those commence walk to spawn zone get to the end of my driveway they both disappear angrily turn around and go back because the app frequently just forgets to drop things post despawn get to my house oops theyre back now i know there are no pokemon in the direction of my house because there is no spawn zone in that direction i walk to the big spawnpoint again they disappear at one point again but end up being there when i get there this also did happen to me with a magmar but despite the rareness i couldnt really be sure it was the only magmar due to it not being near my house that time though it was different i didnt move at all and it was blinking off and on the radar also i caught a magmar before it happened so i dont think there was a magmar that time at all it was just screwing up removing it from the tracker properly conclusion i cannot trust the tracker at all like forget triangulation i do not trust the stupid thing to even be telling me what pokemon are nearby because i know for a fact that isnt consistently accurate i dont even try to look for things because what is the point ill never find it there was a pikachu nearby today i have no idea how people can claim the sightings list can be used as an accurate tracker no amount of math will fix something that isnt even properly displaying what is in range
TheSilphRoad,removed,looking at fastpokemap our charmander pikachu nests in ann arbor are gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this is strange i scanned my nests but i dont see any nest pokemon how annoying perhaps they are not changed in my area yet idk how that works tho should be instant yeah
TheSilphRoad,removed,what are you using to scan
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpimgurcomanwmvn
TheSilphRoad,removed,will keep an eye on this with my scanner the park next to my place changed to a magikarp nest
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon go map is great takes a bit to set up especially if you dont know how to use github but heres a link httpsgithubcompokemongomappokemongomap and a tutorial
TheSilphRoad,removed,i guess youre using pokemongomap so im curious how can you see the pre spawn points also what does the colour of the spawn points mean thanks in advance
TheSilphRoad,removed,your
TheSilphRoad,removed,scanner thought they disabled all appsservices what scanner are you using and how
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use pokevscom you need to manually click your location and it only shows pokemon near that location no login needed
TheSilphRoad,removed,i noticed this well before the appraisal feature update i thought about posting a screenshot of it age ago but everything i post on reddit gets nuked like this comment so i didnt
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not a fan of this silph research bullshit just be upfront about what youre doing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know if anyone else finds this interesting i just saw it and yelled holy shit and decided to share
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can type up this question but couldnt put words into a search engine
TheSilphRoad,removed,my growlithe n cubones are now rats and weedles rip
TheSilphRoad,removed,who knows at discretion is a loosely defined term☹️
TheSilphRoad,removed,currently the gym is fine problem is that i can put a counterexample is that people starts putting crap cp and put them as leader no way that is very stupid and worse that the gym becomes easier than before level gyms are very very easy to solo even level trainers get destroy level gyms with no effort needed ordering cp is like survival of the fittest the crap low cp pokemon gets booted when gym levels down and the strongest remain in gym higher cp means it takes much longer to beat therefore making it harder to beat
TheSilphRoad,removed,snorlax isnt ultra rare especially with a tracking site any urban area neverthless yeah im keeping a snorlax or another of the big at every level if possible for easy prestiging you never know what you are going to see at the bottom of gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip this sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,and yet i still didnt get an invite piss off niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,just say it no one cares about the tos
TheSilphRoad,removed,right because thats the only thing they did in the halloween event
TheSilphRoad,removed,candies when each catch and trade in gives you is terribly low for reference i got over ghastly candy this event but i suppose im in a high spawn area
TheSilphRoad,removed,they removed the other day here minutes into the lures they just vanished
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i would walk five hundred miles but niantic wont let me walk five hundred more
TheSilphRoad,removed,they have probably been looking for the off button but have no effective way to track it down
TheSilphRoad,removed,i sort of understand why part of the game is supposed to be the meta and were left to wonder what might be happening for some things it doesnt make much sense though also a small company like niantic is probably having trouble keeping up didnt the ceo say theyre having problems hiring because almost everyone is so busy working on game stuff they have nearly no time to conduct interviewsconsider candidates id just be glad that the event hasnt ended yet and milk it for all you can enjoy the bonus time whether accidental or not
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is just busy trying to lock out fastpokemap again once they finish screwing that up theyll stop the halloween event im sure
TheSilphRoad,removed,it dont loose
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah theres been like ten good posts on the frontpage over the last month each week it seems to get worse
TheSilphRoad,removed,man just looking in this thread alone you can see theres still a lot of it in this sub though
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed theres still no gamecontent gyms are still a disaster balance is still horrifying combat is still boring etc
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes thank you umsslyx that was the joke
TheSilphRoad,removed,also apparently the event is over source no gastlys or drowzees nearby
TheSilphRoad,removed,thisgameisbroken not
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally ive already caught more useful pokemon since the event ended than its entire duration
TheSilphRoad,removed,am i the only one who doesnt mind eevees from if it has good ivs ima evolve that shit and pray for vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally some sanity making the game easier ie double candy or free stardust does not make the game more fun by itself
TheSilphRoad,removed,me yay its over look at my radar so many non spooky mons cubone appears me fuuuuuccckkkk
TheSilphRoad,removed,and unsurprisingly as soon as the event ends the plus stops sending notifications again come on niantic this crap is getting old
TheSilphRoad,removed,obviously you post before checking your game or anything in this sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,yay gonna play again
TheSilphRoad,removed,generally times i think is overkill its all about the timing especially with server lag i just watch for the pokemon to pause longer than usual and start my dodge tends to work like of the time sometimes my timing is off or the lag is worsebetter than usual and adjust from there everyone plays differently tho
TheSilphRoad,removed,i bet youd be a blast at the parties you never get invited to i made my username my real name for a reason i knew id be beast at the game and i wanted people to know it
TheSilphRoad,removed,repost
TheSilphRoad,removed,flygps
TheSilphRoad,removed,gyms are already in ruins
TheSilphRoad,removed,in my opinion as a high level player as many of you im obsessed with getting the highest ivs in order to get the highest cp out of a pokémon possible amazing iv pokémon are so extremely rare there should be a way to reroll a move set even if that item is rare or can only be bought i would sure as shit pay for an item to reroll move sets i think there needs to be a way to get better moves on amazing iv pokémon
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon go sounds are rubbish im amazed they managed to create such a awful listening experience ingress audio is awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,why does everyone pollute this thread with hurr durr my voltorb nest is a geodude nest now why would that comment be useful in any way to anyone no one even knows where the hell youre talking about
TheSilphRoad,removed,or use fast poke map
TheSilphRoad,removed,i literally cannot dodge psychic with my shit iphone
TheSilphRoad,removed,liar i got eevee from a egg
TheSilphRoad,removed,ditto confirmed
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the stupidest logic ive ever seen on reddit congratulations were all slightly more retarded from reading it you clearly came from rpokemongo with that toxic attitude and eternal victimcomplex
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes reddit is fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,you might want to cover up the name of that service also right now it consistently misses some spawn points so it might mess with your findings until thats fixed
TheSilphRoad,removed,please stop
TheSilphRoad,removed,i enjoyed your comment until your disclaimer was times longer than your actual statement i hate that you deemed it necessary
TheSilphRoad,removed,scan for a better one found one last night
TheSilphRoad,removed,your theory is correct ive caught lapras and they were spawn near magnemite shelder and seel
TheSilphRoad,removed,reposts will kill this sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,i remember the one day one spawned in windsors riverwalk and one about blocks north of the ren cen and one near the riverwalk the facebook groups were going nuts cause everyone just used fpm back then when bored at work or whatever and they were mad they couldnt get any they all spawned like within an hour of eachother
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have downvoted because this has been submitted here before
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is brilliant the whole community is behind him haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats the difference about one working there and elsewhere in the world
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikihentai nsfw
TheSilphRoad,removed,great info but lets be real here wheres the best panty vending machines for the guy who has everything but wants heavily soiled
TheSilphRoad,removed,which scanner are you using
TheSilphRoad,removed,please do no promote use of party apps that mess with the game promotions of these apps are banned from the silph road traveler
TheSilphRoad,removed,the limit is slow enough for city driving kinda too low for suburb or rural its like another handicap for non urban people on top of all the other ones
TheSilphRoad,removed,done
TheSilphRoad,removed,die from cancer
TheSilphRoad,removed,let me quote a wise man
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey man just want to let you know that i couldnt care less what youre doing people are seriously overreacting i suspect people put a lot of money and time into this game right from the beginning expecting it to become much more complex and worthwhile unfortunately its not happening for them and it is creating huge disappointment for these people i play the game every single day and i dont even think about the other people playing the game pokemon just doesnt need to be taken this seriously there are actual options available for competitive pokemon battling there is no reason to be in an uproar over this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow i never read a more american post is sitting in a café or sitting in a car really the only two options how you can attack a gym seriously i have over points on my fighting badges combined and i never sat down to attack or train a gym if walking and standing for an extended period of time is a problem for you that is even more reason to start doing it instead of sitting down whenever you can there are tons of things you can criticize about pokemon go right now not being able to sit down while fighting gyms is none of those
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know i cant so this but here lemme just suck your dick real quick mom thats better can my story stay
TheSilphRoad,removed,well its not impossible you could buy them
TheSilphRoad,removed,in my small city there are gyms we are still about mystic players and a few valor yesterday i discovered that every valor account that we see everyday at gyms lvls is owned by a years old guy with fakegps i saw the gym where i was being taken down and after a few minutes he came personally i asked him quite pissed how many accounts do you have and he proudly replied he takes every gym with accounts during the day and with the other accounts during the night he is the whole valor community here
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah its called tracking its buried so deep in this game you cant even find it
TheSilphRoad,removed,but they do ban spoofers eventually only if theyre dumb
TheSilphRoad,removed,except for the fact that you dont want to walk around fighting for your coins every day when its freezing cold outside and you arent one of the people dumb enough to pay € on gas to claim pokecoins its not fun to battle against low level players who shouldnt stand a chance against you if you compare the ammount of time they have put into their accounts and yours while not feeling your hands because of the temperatures
TheSilphRoad,removed,my god this is like hearing about some poor kid who was blown up by a landmine buried since
TheSilphRoad,removed,can confirm im still spoofing on accounts weekly
TheSilphRoad,removed,they did the killed the spoofers by killing the fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,or he gave up on playing this shitty game like everyone else with half a brain
TheSilphRoad,removed,they just quit like everyone else
TheSilphRoad,removed,youve got elitist tunnelvision i know several people that spoofed on pc to scout locations out for actual play none of them spoof at all anymore because they cant figure out how
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a totally original idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think it might be because no one is paying anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,it doesnt matter ever since the new speedlock the game is over
TheSilphRoad,removed,hah the only people these new security measures hurt is legit players i have my main account on my android and have only played legit bought some coins for incubators and the whole yards i hit pushing in my dex and im regretting spending money now more than ever niantic keeps making the game worse for non cheaters weeks ago fpm goes down no sightings at and i got tired of it i found an old broken iphone at work shattered screen no cell service and installed a hacked client with tap to walk and made a new gmail account i started over and played in san francisco catching rhydon and dodrio and arbok off of lures something you would never see in a suburban area im only collecting all the pokemon in the dex im not much of a gym battler in general so i dont bother trying to hit gyms in san francisco i like to think of myself as a peaceful spoofer just here to enjoy the catch to be clear i havent and will not spoof my main if the game does get better id still like to have all my legit stuff after the banwave seperate accounts seperate devices
TheSilphRoad,removed,just no
TheSilphRoad,removed,even the spoofers dont care about a game that punishes its own players anymore go figure
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,heard that api has been successfully reed again if thats true then im done i quit lets the booters spoofers cheaters mappers etc play among themselves have at it whichever way they want i hope they will keep towering up those gyms with more lapras dragonite and snorlax from the comfort of their couch goodbye pogo and niantic it was a good run
TheSilphRoad,removed,so that part of the game now is unplayable cool
TheSilphRoad,removed,if much lower than before nopejpg little year olds can still follow youtube guides to spoof the security changes made zero differences the only thing is that no one plays pokemon go anymore because niantic effectively killed their own game
TheSilphRoad,removed,this whole update may as well be labelled minor fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,hard to say anything there will encourage people to return
TheSilphRoad,removed,tldr professor willow discovered that eggs have different patterns depending on the distance required to hatch them pokémon type icons have been added to the information screen for each pokémon minor graphic fixes low battery indicator added for the pokémon go plus minor display fixes minor text fixes minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this is true this is the most useless update yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,sound pretty disappointing especially since the last few updates were all very minor as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,the pogo plus would be amazing if they have a stable stock and not just resellers with
TheSilphRoad,removed,i bet they play a lot of ping pong at niantic hq
TheSilphRoad,removed,at least that will shut up all the people who have been complaining about the same coloured eggs oh wait there are none of those people
TheSilphRoad,removed,another update for the sake of putting out an update nothing new and nothing the majority of the community wanted
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mistakenly got a little excited for a second there
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh boy no tracker update i love continuing to begrudgingly stumble around playing without really knowing where to go to get the pokemon i need
TheSilphRoad,removed,there will probably be stealth nerfs hidden in the minor text fixes just have to wait to manually figure out what they are
TheSilphRoad,removed,i keep hoping each update will actually address real problems but they dont
TheSilphRoad,removed,would you look at that still no tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,dat minor text fixes blows my mind from the update there are random minor text fixes stop this niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,you must be the niantic spy
TheSilphRoad,removed,this update was conveniently released when fpm was an hour or two away from being up and running again
TheSilphRoad,removed,botters are no longer working are we sure about that i know fpm used them and its still not up but it seems whatever measures niantic takes to stop botting or spoofing they always find a way around it i still remember how thrilled i was after the first so called ban wave and again when they blocked rooted devices they always come back
TheSilphRoad,removed,less than of players use a go while like would love to catch some pokemon that are nearby sth to track them down would come in handy
TheSilphRoad,removed,the one that has been asked for by the community is only one tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,so two graphical updates that probably somehow consume more battery with stupid code a new popup oh boy for an addon that most dont haveuse a meme that has successfully made the transition from rageinducing to funny but is heading back towards rageinducing again
TheSilphRoad,removed,as the orders messes up it does take me around seconds to see what egg i just got was now itll take me secondsi am going to save up those extra seconds and write a book or something thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok guys so we need to get our fingers out of our butts what can we update idk man i can go into ms paint and change some colors maybe change text a bit genius do it
TheSilphRoad,removed,these updates are groundbreaking how do they do it
TheSilphRoad,removed,they probably changed the hashing function now that fpm is getting close
TheSilphRoad,removed,this isnt the main update is it
TheSilphRoad,removed,all these changes are uigraphicstext related are their coders on strike or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,the fpm guy is really close to cracking the api so some suspect its related
TheSilphRoad,removed,saved seconds best company ever
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic will take you seriously
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i guess they released it because fpm was almost done with the re
TheSilphRoad,removed,would we though or would most a punch of people post about these minor fixes to loads of hype look at the rounding change that occurred with the last update did anyone complain about that or did people get pumped about nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,implying theres anything more substantial to release
TheSilphRoad,removed,why bother with this patch is the better question unless it cuts spoofers off nobody cares
TheSilphRoad,removed,literally saved me second
TheSilphRoad,removed,its refreshing to know that million dollars can get you a good graphic designer
TheSilphRoad,removed,removed pokémon tracking added captcha
TheSilphRoad,removed,one day this game will be great but not today today minor fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,all dozen of them
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait they have a road map does it have a working tracker for everyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,removed hope added despair
TheSilphRoad,removed,sounds like r
TheSilphRoad,removed,i smiledand then i frowned im sure there is a gif for that
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn theyre nuking every comment in this thread that mentions that tracker that must not be named
TheSilphRoad,removed,the kind that has been asked for months ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can see it now nbsp now that you can tell the different eggs apart visually we feel there is no longer a need for the numbers to indicate which eggs are and this of course means that you will no longer be able to track your progress when incubating them but that just adds to the fun youll always be in anticipation for your eggs to hatch fun nbsp niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,kinda interesting to note that they announced it almost as soon as the scanners starts working again
TheSilphRoad,removed,professor willow discovered that eggs have different patterns depending on the distance required to hatch them minor changes now is adjusted to pkm pkm pokilometers unit of distance implemented by niatic to track egg walk distance in pgo game
TheSilphRoad,removed,just fix the crashing please
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes i bet thats nice for all of of you
TheSilphRoad,removed,worst update ever
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn niantic back at it again with the useless updates
TheSilphRoad,removed,might be common for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,isnt it interesting that they announce a new minor update straight after fpm cracked the api
TheSilphRoad,removed,great more time wasted
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah thats obvious the point is that what they do and what they say doesnt match up
TheSilphRoad,removed,enough to crush fpm just as its getting back up im sure
TheSilphRoad,removed,still no mass transfer button still no tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank god there are minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,months later and theyre still adding small insignificant patches at this pony theyve either given up on the game and are just not telling anyone or theres only one guy working on all the content how long do we have to wait before the game is an actual game and not a glorified easter egg hunt months years never
TheSilphRoad,removed,beside the battery indicator the rest can be done in minutes with photoshop way to go niantic awesome update
TheSilphRoad,removed,im so sad i absolutely love the concept of the game but it has been out for what now comparing the game from months ago to the game today what has changed tracker was removed we got the buddy system and few very minor changes like this egg thing now the medals and gym training changes like come on guys i want to love this game i want to play it obssessively but i just cant enjoy it like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing pleases the masses i guess lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracking is what needs to be done everything else just gets a nice try button from me
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracking is what needs to be done everything else just gets a nice try button from me
TheSilphRoad,removed,nice another update that ads nothing to make this game more fun its like theyre painting a room and painting a square of each wall weeks at a time
TheSilphRoad,removed,trackers go live update released weird
TheSilphRoad,removed,the snarkiness in this thread reminds me of rpokemongo personally im quite happy with the battery notification feature for pogo
TheSilphRoad,removed,they arent that clever
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow cant believe battles trading and tracking were implemented oh wait just another useless nonpatch
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor text update fun removed from game
TheSilphRoad,removed,even someone who was in their position didnt know why they were keeping quiet lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am fine with speed limit but trackers come on we all know they want more money out of people that buy lures and incenses
TheSilphRoad,removed,pretty sure the exclamation point here is sarcasm right
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre kidding right
TheSilphRoad,removed,the kind of logic that wise leaders in north korea would appreciate
TheSilphRoad,removed,i absolutely agree traveler this update shows they are listening as it fixes the biggest complaint ive seen recoloring eggs it shows they are communicating by helpfully informing us of minor text fixes i also absolutely agree that this update takes nothing away from us and that people should be grateful for that at the very least keep the positivity flowing and the serial complainers out of this sub d d d
TheSilphRoad,removed,typical niantic blame it on prof willow instead of themselves
TheSilphRoad,removed,well given that its a pokemon game i kinda expected it to play like a pokemon game you know battling wild pokemon for xp battling other trainers trading etc i dont really see how you defend a game that they admitted only has about of the content intended so far that would be like releasing a cod game with only the target practice mode available for the first months of he games release the only thing this game has in common with pokemon is the name
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantics been busy with this instead of a new and improved radar
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry i promise ill be more careful next time
TheSilphRoad,removed,just plain weird pretty much removes all relevant involvement with the game itself a rat could probably be trained to push the button at the right times i can also see electronics hackers making autopush circuitry for this sense the colourpulse of the led and push the button you dont need to do anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,boooooo
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would nut in my pants
TheSilphRoad,removed,you think of that yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,hah bound to sale for sure hell ill uy one just for that feature alone
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemesh
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol dont understand the game im beating snot lax with an vaporeon consistently yesterday but yeah idk how to dodge and definitely dont understand the game fuck outta here
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpswwwpokeeyecom
TheSilphRoad,removed,i did niantic burned me not making that mistake again
TheSilphRoad,removed,how dipshit weve had rooted phones for years
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpspokestumblecom i havent really used it but seen it used by others use the filter to filter out the other stuff if you just want gym info just click on an area on the map and it should tell you all the gyms in your area the team currently holding it
TheSilphRoad,removed,google pokemon cheat forum and ask there
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemesh
TheSilphRoad,removed,psa
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not certain the migration happens reports are mixed its hard to tell what species comes after hitmonchan as of yet cause were still new to this whole nest migration thing it will take a few migrations before a pattern hopefully emerges i suggest using one of those scanners to see whats there now or if the park aint far take a walk there and let us know
TheSilphRoad,removed,jesus christ wtf are you even talking about
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i so hate when i had to drive across the whole state only to find out that theres no nest of zapdos there
TheSilphRoad,removed,the amount of analysis in this post for how long it is is almost zero you just list a bunch of stuff and arbitrarily decide on moltres with basically zero reasoning
TheSilphRoad,removed,your sarcasm is so salty thanks for adding to the rest of the white noise a true contribution worthy of yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
TheSilphRoad,removed,tldr attack things with the type they are weak against
TheSilphRoad,removed,kinda see this same post asked every
TheSilphRoad,removed,so like i said there arent dratini nests
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup the atlas clearly became pointless to me after the migration and the whole concept of the silph road is pretty much dead imo because its gonna be alot easier and less work to just wait for a migration than building a chain of trust of people to exchange the pokemon you want
TheSilphRoad,removed,unless youre listening to a live stream then youre just screwed because niantic cant write code that follows any best practices these twats cant even incorporate a volume control in their own app
TheSilphRoad,removed,you had one job
TheSilphRoad,removed,that sounds like an exercise in futility
TheSilphRoad,removed,psa ive noticed that as of today does not search to see if a thread has been posted times before reposting it himself
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am so glad someone mentioned this i really hope that this isnt a feature i hate it i like have the sound of spawning pokemon and the sound of pokestops coming in range but in order to hear my podcast i have to turn the sound to and then have my ears be blasted by the high picked sounds of collecting items from stops it sucks rant
TheSilphRoad,removed,i did a bit of a chortle fart snort hiccup belch smirk
TheSilphRoad,removed,so the feedback about the tracker will be i love it i was able to get one rare pokemon useless only shows commons it will be useless of the time till you get luck to cross something worth being tracked add the fact that people dont leave in sf heaven we are doomed
TheSilphRoad,removed,all this update is going to do is make me start using party trackers only seeing pokemon in sightings is too much of a nerf
TheSilphRoad,removed,aye at least you get to go to college for free id take that shit any day
TheSilphRoad,removed,noooo life
TheSilphRoad,removed,party trackers seemed to have this feature like day one so it cant be that hard
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree with that pretty much if you are over speed for the game the pokestops dont work im used to getting a few on my drive to work but now i will have to actually go out of my way to stop and get them poor form niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,well aint that just dandy
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup a low blow for me as someone riding along from job to job
TheSilphRoad,removed,just noticed this spinning stops as a passenger this is my source of farming pokeballs jesus just keep taking all the playability out of this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,when will niantic learn that not everyone in a moving vehicle is driving that vehicle
TheSilphRoad,removed,really well guess that might be the end of the line for me then running hour days for my internship so i really dont feel like going outside and walk circles through my towns center to get some much needed pokéballs such a shame hope niantic will revert this but im pretty sure they wont
TheSilphRoad,removed,just noticed this it sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a good update but i wanna see some legendary pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,why cant niantic understand people play that arent driving trains buses car passengers etc its like no one that makes the decisions there has any logic or experience playing their own game this is so frustrating i want to love this game but they are making it harder and harder
TheSilphRoad,removed,so they are adding priority for taking over a gym but no priority for leveling up a gym who decides this stuff and why do they still have a job
TheSilphRoad,removed,had the same thing happen to me however it seemed to be mph or more for it to stop working niantic is really try to kill this game for anyone who doesnt walk slowly everywhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,trying to hide another shitty hidden change while dropping an update adding a couple new features thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool but no tracker for the rest of us
TheSilphRoad,removed,wheres this from first time i heard
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was noticing it around or so i was wondering if it was just me one more way for them to mess up the game i guess
TheSilphRoad,removed,waaah waaah i just want to go kaching kaching every hours f niantic for taking away my free gyms okay
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep the speed lock was changed so you cant even spin stops in a car with winter almost here this finally kills the game for me so glad i didnt buy a plus today
TheSilphRoad,removed,so is this place turning into rpokemongo someone asks if this is normal and if he should report the person half these responses are a bunch of hens clucking that its people like op that scare them sorry this game has a history of spoofers and cheaters op was asking a perfectly legitimate question if you think the answer is no there are reasonable ways to say it without being jerks stalk back off to your pokemongo sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,i live in minnesota im not going to farm while walking through snow at degrees goodbye pokémon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,with they had kept their mouth shut i hate losing gyms and it takes forever to train up already
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is bullshit its a persons choice if they choose to drive and play and people who ride and play shouldnt be punished
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this is the death of the pogo was the only reason i kept it was to farm pokeballs on the ride to work thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game is about making money not walking though they seem to want to significantly limit their profits
TheSilphRoad,removed,f the children what about the adults bill maher said this in the and hes still right
TheSilphRoad,removed,so the game is literally unplayable at more than jogging pace great
TheSilphRoad,removed,use search or look at the front page
TheSilphRoad,removed,great update for the winter smart dev team
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip everyone who bought a poke
TheSilphRoad,removed,confirming pokestops wont work over and even if i slow down right before the pokestop im still locked out of spinning it welp im screwed now my town only has pokestops scattered around the entire town and over half of those are so far away that the only way to reasonably hit them up is via car and theyre places where you cant easily stop and park to wait to get unbanned so you can spin them now im not going to be able to keep enough item stock gee thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,nerf gym training again niantic destroying competition not everyone can snatch a prestige while training niantic giving medals to those who barely put in work 👇
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the worst thing they could have done
TheSilphRoad,removed,im no longer certain if its going to be darker for the users or the games future at this rate
TheSilphRoad,removed,so aggravating
TheSilphRoad,removed,and there goes my interest in purchasing the plus again
TheSilphRoad,removed,argh this may just be the last straw for me living rural theres only pokestops in a mile radius of my house and they are miles apart the only way ive been able to keep playing competitively is by getting my missus to drive me to the nearest decent town about miles away and repeatedly drive a minute stop loop evenings a week even then im only just keeping enough provisions to see me through i dont wish to be melodramatic but i just dont see a way to keep playing for me i spend circa £ on the game and im sure this will be the end for plenty of others too maybe theyll reconsider when it hits them in the pocket
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes just took my bus to uni and i kept getting try again later when at speed this sucks as niantic has pretty much stopped me from playing their game until my semester is over
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres no other company like niantic that tries so hard to make their players stop playing their game
TheSilphRoad,removed,pogo no longer works while driving over this totally stinks
TheSilphRoad,removed,i believe the speed limit similar to sightings has been activated on pokéstops is niantic trying to remove players from this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry but it is pure retardness from them to think they have to do it from a legal point of my view if they are doing that because of the japanese driver that killed a kid while playing pogo while shouldnt we expect phone manufacturers to impose a speed limit at which you can use your phone also why are cars allowed if people can kill other people with those i cant wrap my head around how mind boggingly stupid the people that push those kind of changes are
TheSilphRoad,removed,im having the same problems as everybody else any way we can get our money back ive spent a good deal of money on this game but i dont have stops that are walkable very easily i just have my girlfriend play while i drive to get stops even going as slow as mph it wouldnt register a bunch of them
TheSilphRoad,removed,speed limit those garbage heads
TheSilphRoad,removed,huge
TheSilphRoad,removed,me and my roommates were just talking about this weve all agreed that this is the reason to finally stop playing because it is going to severely limit our access to pokeballs there are nights where we would cruise the mainstreet and beachside area and come away with multiple hundreds of pokeballs but now if we cant do that were not going to risk our safety by walking that area in the middle of the night
TheSilphRoad,removed,out of friends i am the last one left my kids stopped playing when or under rule eliminated their ability to play while we went shopping now pokestops fu niantic this should free up a lot of server space for you good riddance
TheSilphRoad,removed,they decide to start giving out bonuses for hitting pokestops once a day but then they prevent you from hitting pokestops while driving genius
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh well my hour commute to downtown tokyo now sucks i used to get stops each way but today so far about almost there time to find a new game
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this was it they finally killed the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont think youll like this hidden update
TheSilphRoad,removed,daily thread for i caught a thing simple questions memegarbage profit
TheSilphRoad,removed,another pokemon was placed in the free download section in the free download section in the other threads
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you take two fingers and drum at the local hotspot at tonight there were people at the screen as quickly as possible
TheSilphRoad,removed,list of pokemon natures these sound like things that would affect stats but ive seen no discussions on them can anyone shed some light
TheSilphRoad,removed,whos pokeballs do i have to fondle to get in
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was leveling up a gym of my team yesterday was taking quite a bit of potions in the end some asshole from my team sniped the spot i made
TheSilphRoad,removed,quit playing then
TheSilphRoad,removed,create a site that snoops pokemon locations around the world and so the user can set up an alert to inform them when say a dragonite is within of them or a specified location
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe you should have stripped your way to spelling school because even with english as a third language i know its spelled reknowned
TheSilphRoad,removed,makes the npr app unusable god forbid i want to listen to news and play pogo
TheSilphRoad,removed,this new gym system is pokémon gos demise
TheSilphRoad,removed,haha the optimism in you is strong
TheSilphRoad,removed,if i spend years grinding towards level and they reset im sending a pipe bomb to niantics hq
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont know i tried the one on pokeassistantcom but it didnt seem to take candies gained from evolutions into account so i just made my own
TheSilphRoad,removed,this plus the fact that a cp rattata breaks out of balls consistently now wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah its cleared them out and most of those players are quitting because theres no point to the game anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,too bad ive never seen a nest in my area at all theres areas with more pokemon areas with rarer pokemon but ive never seen an area i would consider a nest with multiple spawns of the same pokemon and i mapped the area for like two months using pokemongomap
TheSilphRoad,removed,grow up stop caring about internet points
TheSilphRoad,removed,isnt there a time limit on prestiging if not it should be a thing
TheSilphRoad,removed,the problem i have is it favors attacking way more already so i think making it is fair here are some of the reasons why i think this iteration of the gym meta is dumb attackers can gang up on a gym and it doesnt have to be a member from your own team ex blue and red can attack yellow at the same time thats a massive advantage already solution cap this to or attackers so groups of friends can still do it prestige per pokemon beat is dumb af i dont mind getting a massive clear bonus since that rewards someone who actually knows wth hes doing coz trust me a full clear is no easy task especially on a stacked well thought out level gym solution already mentioned bigger bonus by clearing and beating the gym leader similar to point its dumb af to lose per pokemon even though youre attacking with a vs a arcanine i think the half cp rewarddouble cp penalty should go both ways not just on prestiging but in battling as well solution already provided halfcp attacker reward double cp attacker penalty another dumb idea from niantic it takes literally one pokemon battle to remove a the lowest member from a level gym when prestiging it to makes massive amount of resources solution change the threshold to but keep the cap that way when someone adds their mon they can still prestige it from this update favors teams with more players solution not that bad of a problem to have a solution to
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly this the problem i have is it favors attacking way more already so i think making it is fair here are some of the reasons why i think this iteration of the gym meta is dumb attackers can gang up on a gym and it doesnt have to be a member from your own team ex blue and red can attack yellow at the same time thats a massive advantage already solution cap this to or attackers so groups of friends can still do it prestige per pokemon beat is dumb af i dont mind getting a massive clear bonus since that rewards someone who actually knows wth hes doing coz trust me a full clear is no easy task especially on a stacked well thought out level gym solution already mentioned bigger bonus by clearing and beating the gym leader similar to point its dumb af to lose per pokemon even though youre attacking with a vs a arcanine i think the half cp rewarddouble cp penalty should go both ways not just on prestiging but in battling as well solution already provided halfcp attacker reward double cp attacker penalty another dumb idea from niantic it takes literally one pokemon battle to remove a the lowest member from a level gym when prestiging it to makes massive amount of resources solution change the threshold to but keep the cap that way when someone adds their mon they can still prestige it from this update favors teams with more players solution not that bad of a problem to have a solution to
TheSilphRoad,removed,just replying to tell you i down voted you
TheSilphRoad,removed,and the hash function has already been cracked so its now chewing our batteries up for no reason whatsoever
TheSilphRoad,removed,fat lazy people voted you up lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is also the biome i live in a lot of fire ground and poison pokemon plus there is another couples of biomes this thread is missing just saying for future documentation there is an electric ice biome i see sometimes in malls and less so in piers magnemite and voltorb are common shellder and seel are rare also spawns jigglypuff and occasionally lapras but dont quote me on that there is a jungle biome i witnessed when i went to the amazon in my vacations oddish bellsprout poliwag magikarp pidgey weedle and caterpie are common gastly eggxecute tentacool and pinsir are rare bulbasaur squirtle lickitung and tangela are very rare ucontrovt
TheSilphRoad,removed,im tired of this white knight posts i dont have perception of increased battery consumption its not cognitive bias its numbers its screen on time its on every android device lets not make everything into a statistical analysis if it is clear no there is not a billion other reasons there could be a few but as i already explained in the original post every time i made a clean slate i just tested with the app just opened just opened on the table on wifi with brightness around of ost before it hit the
TheSilphRoad,removed,could you please link me any evidence obviously im too dumb finding any only random users saying blablabla the catch rate flee rate and all other mechanics for ditto are identical to the trash pokemon id like to see any real evidence because my expierience definitely is different and please dont use phrases like conformation bias because i was fucking surprised by my first ditto days ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats why were here someone on the road finds it the whole world sees it we will help the casuals we just want some serious sht
TheSilphRoad,removed,yet people frown upon on us spoofers when we are the safest players around haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,well they never said it was an asia regional pokémon tauros mr mime farfetchd and kanghiskan are merely regional pokémon the definition of region is an area with defined boundaries that can be of any size or shape the region for each pokémon is best defined as follows tauros mainland usa well at least they tried to bound it within this region but added some parts of canada and mexico while omitting southern florida mr mime europe kangiskhan australia yes just this region is just one country farfetchd east asia thats why korea japan hong kong and taiwan gets it i am curious where you found the source that says farfetchd is a regional pokémon for the whole of asia
TheSilphRoad,removed,old
TheSilphRoad,removed,so are they just going to scrap the new nearby tracker niantic needs to get it together months down the drain they need better critical thinkers or get input from another company because thats just a waste of resources and time
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope this pos is still pointing me at a couple of pokestops that are a minute walk from my location there is a pidgey and a weedle waiting for me my tracker shows other pokémon much closer some of which are worth a damn
TheSilphRoad,removed,post from the top on silph road really
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should bring back levels and turnbased battling like every other pokémon game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i look for low gyms with available spots or enemy gyms its a joke of a game as far as the gym scene currently
TheSilphRoad,removed,after the game updates it will eventually let you do your weird things just make sure not to scare the shit out of old hags or old men
TheSilphRoad,removed,yawn
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic we worked tirelessly day and night and we fixed all the bugs and implemented everything you asked for even the things that contradict the other things also pokecoins are now free in the store all your complaints have been answered rpokemongo you took away all the things to complain about fck you niantic salt
TheSilphRoad,removed,just another way rurals are getting screwed by niantic no traffic
TheSilphRoad,removed,plow my wife was all i got from that first paragraph
TheSilphRoad,removed,having followed my fair share of facebook posts in my local team group i can definitely say that there is not much you can do to stop people using crappy sources they will keep using them time and time again and you should not really care anyway i think its even worse in non english native countries since the best source to use is tsr and its in english so people that dont speak english have to resort to an intermediary to get their information and its harder for them to identify what is a valid source or not
TheSilphRoad,removed,poll ruined by a dead joke
TheSilphRoad,removed,have you thought that possibly maybe just maybe the christmas events includes the release of new pokémon
TheSilphRoad,removed,god what a silly post
TheSilphRoad,removed,probably will be posted soon in the comments because hes karmawhoring with an image link post
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill probably get voted down for this but whatever points yep seems about right
TheSilphRoad,removed,jesus man were going on like a week and a half since they updated it to show both and this has been posted once per hour here and on rpokemongo since then
TheSilphRoad,removed,no no it isnt
TheSilphRoad,removed,jeez you just gave me a miniheartattack
TheSilphRoad,removed,he or she is referring to their own interest in the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic trying to rack up money by having trainers buy lots of incubators
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was so excited when i saw this thread then saw no update yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,so theyre telling me i need to walk a lot in winter thanks niantic s
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic should give us a discount on incubators at least
TheSilphRoad,removed,kinda hoped to see some in the wild not just hatch some from eggs with a very limited chance of it being a new one
TheSilphRoad,removed,so baby pokemon we have to hatchyay
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this is it this is pretty disappointing and a pretty cynical way to have people clear their current egg backlog
TheSilphRoad,removed,hatch eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait so theyre not releasing the whole generation at once just a few of them wtf man
TheSilphRoad,removed,it didnt even occur to me that the announcement could be this underwhelming a few new pokemon you can only get through eggs damn
TheSilphRoad,removed,can someone make a tl dw
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that was as underwhelming as i thought it would be
TheSilphRoad,removed,eh
TheSilphRoad,removed,please tell me this isnt the entire announcement for today
TheSilphRoad,removed,womp womp womp
TheSilphRoad,removed,is that it
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey guys i have an idea now that half the country is being blanketed by inches of snow lets release an update for pokemon that requires them to go outside and walk
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats it
TheSilphRoad,removed,well thats underwhelming they created hype to sell incubators
TheSilphRoad,removed,its up
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am incredibly underwhelmed
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow only releasing a few at a time is the most underwhelming way to do it and only through eggs is the most greedy way to do it thats cynical but can you blame me most of us were expecting an announcement of the whole gen ii today
TheSilphRoad,removed,so disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this is their big announcement we have been waiting since thanksgiving for i will just uninstall the game until spring wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,so im thinking we will need to buy incubators to clear out our existing egg stashes if pokemon hatched are determined at time of egg pickup sneaky sneaky
TheSilphRoad,removed,nice try niantic but im not spending any more money on incubators is that it its just so not what id wanted after all that snow haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,good luck hatching enough eggs for that
TheSilphRoad,removed,walking km to maybe get a new pokemon when its cold as outside yea i guess ill pass
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh good temps are in the single digits and now i need to go hatch a bunch of eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,major let down an incomplete announcement that was late for most of the world niantic needs to understand that they are in control of a global game not a sf game and that is pretty poor in details over what to expect for the next few months moreover hatching eggs in a great part of the world is really a problem right now even though i think this is might be a way forward to announce i think they were quite poor on introducing it the hype was intense and most of us are going to be pretty sad with this info
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol agreed they said it was only an announcement and half the sub expected to have caught all of gen by now
TheSilphRoad,removed,so pikachu with a santa hat is the winter promo
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow next few months super disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,eggs are set when you pick them up so i guess not unfortunately
TheSilphRoad,removed,this better not be the event no extra dust or candy or xp no you can have a stupid pikachu wearing a santa hat ffs niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this is the only crp they are going to release today im gonna have to sit down with niantic and have an serious adult talk with them
TheSilphRoad,removed,and the hype train comes to a stop
TheSilphRoad,removed,not spending more money on incubators sorry niantic also this reduces the chance of getting eggs i need
TheSilphRoad,removed,unless you count the stupid holiday pikachu as the event in which case im seriously not impressed
TheSilphRoad,removed,this internet in a nutshell
TheSilphRoad,removed,not sure if trolling or serious
TheSilphRoad,removed,right wow niantic talk about a let down it would be better if they at least announced an event to go with it that was half the distance walked on eggs or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,they really should have made clear that gen is not coming from the start everybody expected big things and all we get is a hat and a small chance to hatch a baby pokemon somday in the next couple of days after collecting new eggs niantic was on a good way this is kind of a disappointing news
TheSilphRoad,removed,im perplexed we can hatch select gen ii pokémonwhen are we expected to be able to catch gen ii in the wild are we to assume that niantic will drop feed gen ii over the course of a couple months if that is there plan it makes me want to put the game down for a couple months until everything is out im not jumping to conclusions but there are certainly questions that i really want answered
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes you pay niantic money for incubators then you walk kilometres or so
TheSilphRoad,removed,go over to rpokemon go for the salt show should be starting any minute now
TheSilphRoad,removed,terrible news give as something real
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was expecting some kind of christmas event involving candystardustxp in spite of the latest holidays events quite underwhelming
TheSilphRoad,removed,was hoping at least for reduced buddy or egg distance im not sure the remote chance of scoring new baby pokes will inspire me to buy incubators
TheSilphRoad,removed,with every niantic announcement is always insane amounts of backlash
TheSilphRoad,removed,be sure to drink your ovaltine
TheSilphRoad,removed,eh
TheSilphRoad,removed,this would be ok if i wasnt forced into walking my full bag of eggs first because theyll still be trash i dont need
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this was underwhelming no extra incentive at all to go out and play will be sticking to trips to relevant nests until there is actually more to catch in the wild
TheSilphRoad,removed,over the next few months such a tease new pokémon at once would be enough to kick this game back into high gear new pokémon ill be entertained for a week max
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey trainers for christmas youre going to give us the gift of incubator purchases
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah niantic has certainly no issue with pr whatsoever
TheSilphRoad,removed,im annoyed theres no way to trash old eggs for new ones without having to forcefully spend coins for incubators in order to clear them out
TheSilphRoad,removed,they believe thats an incentive to purchase incubators theres no way im going to spend coins or waste the expendable incubators i have for a chance to hatch togepi pichu and select others
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this is kinda disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,most disappointing news since santa isnt real
TheSilphRoad,removed,biggest egg pool also means most commonly dropped though i probably get at least or eggs for every and or or more for every if these guys dropped from lessfrequentlyreceived eggs people would probably be even more annoyed
TheSilphRoad,removed,if only we had the option of dumping eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,one would hope that niantic would at least increase the odds of one of the new pokemon dropping in eggs for awhile otherwise good luck hatching them all ever
TheSilphRoad,removed,sonuvabitch
TheSilphRoad,removed,of course people are upset by this announcement you cant walk around acting like a smug dbag about the contents of an upcoming announcement and not be upset when youre wrong and in a position where you have to admit youre wrong its just not fair man
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait so our december event is pikachu in a hat wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly i expect the worst from niantic so this is actually a pleasant surprise
TheSilphRoad,removed,o my god i hate it d
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeahfrom eggs unless they improve the chances the would be pretty low specially if they come from eggs needing to hatch like eggs to obtain a togepi doesnt sound fun honestly if babies were released in the wild then the anouncement would have been ok
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is so shitty not salty for real neither the first gen is complete they start the second and a pikachu with santa claus hat thats what we waited for common they can do better
TheSilphRoad,removed,let us pray
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a shame eggs have been shown to be predetermined this means the first batch of walking is for not
TheSilphRoad,removed,lul
TheSilphRoad,removed,she thicc
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a cash grab no question about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,pikachu looks happy all the others look mildly pissed just like us maybe niantic knew and is just being sarcastic there
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously no bonuses the disappointment is real
TheSilphRoad,removed,i tried posting this and the bot restricted me
TheSilphRoad,removed,ugh new mon only available from eggs besides pikachu wearing a hat what a joke niantic getting paid again
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic announcement buy more incubators thanks buy
TheSilphRoad,removed,can anyone tell me which of their employees is responsible for this hat model it looks so f c k n bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,thigh gap wide enough to drive a truck through
TheSilphRoad,removed,its niantic you have options a they just forgot b r
TheSilphRoad,removed,wellthis is kinda underwhelming
TheSilphRoad,removed,in my opinion the holiday event will be a disappointment if we get pokemon in a hat prior events gave us reduced hatching distance double exp double dust etc hatching new pokemon is very exciting but it could also be viewed as a money grab i want to catch them in the wild as well not just hatch via eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,thought it was a wallpaper version of the load screen just noticed its not photo shopped yet le sadness
TheSilphRoad,removed,still a big disappointment
TheSilphRoad,removed,that would be even more disappointing than the announcement
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would buy incubators if they would spawn something other than shit pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,not happy just horny
TheSilphRoad,removed,no i wont the event is honestly really bad like pineapple on pizza levels of bad having only the baby pokemon as new pokemons thats fine im ok with it and makes me wonder if they will put more attacks for the rest of pokemon no problem with this part they only comes from eggs thats bullshit first of all only happens in new eggs good luck knowing which eggs are new unless you have incubators going on secondly the chances are probably quite low eggs have a lot of possibilities and thirdly why arent those pokemons in the wild that would make this release quite ok imo lastly santachu im just dissapointed this is so lame only one pokemon with hat and during days either it spams a lot and people get bored after a few days like on halloween or it spams a little and a lot of people arent able to obtain it putting hats or something on more pokemons would have make this way more exciting all in all the event is bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,so niantics money making plan seems to work out
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats much better would be even better if we could throw away eggs they are shit pokemon of the time
TheSilphRoad,removed,no human being stands that way this is like spiderwoman comic cover level of ignorance on how women stand
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed i wasnt expecting all of to drop maybe legendary birds but this is pretty minimal effort from niantic its pretty much just a hat and pokemon i understand they are starting to roll out but pokemon to start seems pretty minimal i would have rather have all out before we get useless pokemon from especially since we can only get them from eggs theyre just asking for us to spend money with minimal return if you want more people spending money you better make it worth it incense suck pokeballs are crazy expensive
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we please stop with this can we take a moment to thank niantic nonsense they make money of off this they are not doing it because of virtue
TheSilphRoad,removed,facepalm
TheSilphRoad,removed,so we are suppose to stop and thank them because they want to make money
TheSilphRoad,removed,no what happened to the silph road being about pokemon research
TheSilphRoad,removed,personally i feel quite disappointed as this is just a not so thinly veiled way of getting people to buy incubators ever since eggs somehow became even more prolific in number i have felt disenfranchised from purchasing them and this doesnt exactly help the situation
TheSilphRoad,removed,feels a bit underwhelming imo s
TheSilphRoad,removed,to thank them for what for shity togepi and pichu i want new pokes at once
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantics money making plan niantics bait so let me get that straight you want a good quality gamefor freewithout niantic making any money out of it no one has put a knife to your throat and said buy incubators stop crying around i wonder if you all could develop a game in pogos scale and keep it up for free people over there gotta eat too whats stupid is that no one is excited that we get the baby pokémon only through eggs the rest is held for now which could possibly mean a new evolving system such as the one with the friendship possible breeding now im hyped fir gen ii cause pogo is gonna enter a bit deeper and get a bit complicated therefore interesting and manwho doesnt love pikachuespecially with some silly cosmetics
TheSilphRoad,removed,this was hoping for a much broader and substantial set of updates
TheSilphRoad,removed,no this is the most greedy way they could possibly launch gen ii a few at a time only through eggs it will continuously encourage incubator purchases until they start showing up on the map i would have absolutely loved all of the gen ii pokémon at once that would have been big and exciting not to mention it would have drawn people back to the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey trainers we have added two new pokemons so go out there and buy more incubators you tools and merry christmas you tools love niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,im going to skip the witty condescending replies and just say fuck you op
TheSilphRoad,removed,no shit the only difference is he has a hat on
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy fuck that buddy picture is adorable
TheSilphRoad,removed,you cant just say that man
TheSilphRoad,removed,for those interested in the iv according to pokeassistant running the same numbers as shown this would not be perfect iv range
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah but later in that thread the idiot admitted he isnt even sure if it was a
TheSilphRoad,removed,tip when something new is happening in pogo go check the subreddits new section
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow new pokemon that you can only hatch with incubators niantics type of dlc
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow just dont buy anything this game doesnt deserve more money
TheSilphRoad,removed,it would be ok if you could catch those but this is just a hit in the face to people that dont want to pay any money
TheSilphRoad,removed,it would be ok if you could catch those but this is just a hit in the face to people that dont want to pay any money
TheSilphRoad,removed,you could have easily have worded this in a way that didnt make you sound like some pissy littler girl who didnt have things go her way yet you didnt congratulations
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh fuckknuckles here we go bois
TheSilphRoad,removed,go earn your own money
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats adorable
TheSilphRoad,removed,would love for his metronome to randomly choose the move transform against a transformed ditto i wanna see you code that shit niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,putting ones beliefs ahead of whats actually true is the whole point of religions p i doubt theyll actually be putting things out every day though probably just an event around the and the rest of gen on ny or some such
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantics spirit of christmas giving us something even worse in our eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,and squirtle got no shame getting a peak at dat azz
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh you mean by holding gyms that gyms that are rarer than a lapras in my rural area thanks for reminding me
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this game doesnt change anything it will die this update didnt change much so those who are still playing are allowed to critize
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,udronpes ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly the game as a whole gets old pretty quickly for most people whether you cheat or not i had about two weeks of fun playing normally once i realized that most gyms in my area were getting taken over by spoofers and that no rare pokemon were spawning near me anyway i stopped bothering then i made several bot accounts running various community bot scripts to test which ones were most efficient that was honestly the most fun ive had in the game and got me to start looking into learning python too after a week or two of doing that i was basically done with the game its not a negative thing i got several weeks worth of entertainment out of it and didnt expect it to be longlasting ingress held my interest for much longer because there was more of a community aspect to it where coordination was rewarded while pogo is mostly a solo game
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey guys i dont know if this is cheating or not but on my main account i completed my dex playing legit im on team valor level so like what many others would do after completing their dex is to do gyms with the goal of trying to hold gyms for the daily bonus but i realize soon after that there was a huge problem every gym in my area is a level valor gym i cant seem to ever see an open slot for me to put something in i was very frustrated and bored and i definitely did not want to go catch anymore pokemon that i already owned so i created a second mystics account i played my alt account legit just like my main never spoof botted or used hacks i went out and did my fair share of walking biking and chasing after rares my mystics account is now at level and my main purpose of using it was to knock out the lower cp mon in a level valor gym so that i can have a spot in that gym with my main i know you guys are gonna say thats cheating and thats fine you are entire to your own opinion and i respect that but please know that both my accounts are played legit meaning that i went outside and did all that fun stuff if there were just more content or something that will keep me motivated to only play on one account then i wouldve never created an alt account also it seems like nobody nowadays wants to take down level gyms at least in my area so its hard for me to get a spot in any gym but now with my mystics account i dont have to worry about that anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive seen and caught wild dratinis im level politely fuck you sorry this is just not fair
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally a tracker that works
TheSilphRoad,removed,they arent going to do christian holidays since niantic is smart and knows no god exists
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude what are you doing this is the internet we dont show appreciation here
TheSilphRoad,removed,god they literally changed one line in the code as much candies thats it not bad but definitely not praise worthy
TheSilphRoad,removed,then how is stamina attack and defense determined
TheSilphRoad,removed,as always niantic trying to reduce the amount of players that play the game why bother to add a new tracker lets add other random and less requested features
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyre too busy making events where all we get are gastlies cubones and meowths
TheSilphRoad,removed,if only they put this much work into actually fixing their own tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,the good news is that the player base is shrinking faster than they can expand capacity so it wont be an issue for long without major changes to the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,scanners are vital to successful game play be it local scanner apps or the web based which i like better as they generate a lot less load on the servers until a scanner like feature is implemented in the client they are here to stay used by the overwhelming majority of the player base and niantic only has themselves to blame also as a career systems engineer lets not buy into the overstated resource suck that scanners add in terms of handshaking with the servers so i disagree with you they should be lauded and used if niantic wants to stop them then they will have to fix the tracking features
TheSilphRoad,removed,for the people who want to walk why should others suffer because you want to walk instead of use a bike or drive somewhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game is absolutly broken beyond recognition not just the holy trinity dragonite snorlax lapras are far better than any other mons in the game but also vaporeons also completly warped the little meta that was left outside that little box
TheSilphRoad,removed,in northern ireland for some reason every nest is in a small part of northern belfast which is totally unfair none in the entire rest of the country but about there
TheSilphRoad,removed,you idiot its the same pokemonthey spawn for like minutes
TheSilphRoad,removed,because he all his incubators are infinite you idiot he ballin
TheSilphRoad,removed,haha you people upvoted their app when theyve done nothing and now you get this garbage sheep
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont frequent that area enough to say for sure ive caught three there and am only in that general vicinity a few times a month one around noon when i asked my coworker to check pokevision since we were driving past anyways and the other two more recently in the evenings when the gf and i were making late night bad decision cub food runs
TheSilphRoad,removed,or anywhere outside of major metropolitan areas
TheSilphRoad,removed,opening xcode port urself to st monica pier enjoy
TheSilphRoad,removed,im honestly fading fast and the recent update does not do well on my basic phone
TheSilphRoad,removed,well fvck me for trying to have some fun right
TheSilphRoad,removed,and whats up with nests being on private golf courses this what was niantic thinking
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have a disability that has caused me to wear those since i was like five id probably deck you for that
TheSilphRoad,removed,guess how many people care
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is what i dont like about pokemon go i hope they change it
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank you this sub has been terrible lately
TheSilphRoad,removed,havent gotten one yet probably not gonna spend on something that only throws one normal pokeball and thats it its not gonna catch anything for me unless its catch rate is severely enhanced and we havent been told about it i also dont live any where near a good cluster of pokestops so i wouldnt get much use out of it there either maybe if it was or id consider it if it gets good reviews no way id pay as it is right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,gotta catch em all
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can see the pokemon added in the latest min httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidorgpokelandpokeland
TheSilphRoad,removed,yah same here i want to check my venusaurs iv just evolved that pokemon awhile ago sorry for my good english insert sarcasm
TheSilphRoad,removed,we got a shit ton of those too
TheSilphRoad,removed,what kind of retarded theroy is this what if lol gtfo youre just starting stupid conversations
TheSilphRoad,removed,small tip prepare your second account in a different team
TheSilphRoad,removed,its extremely strange fuck it ill make up this word real quick
TheSilphRoad,removed,this game is the best psychological experiment ever give people random data and watch them foam at the mouth trying to order it for no reason and act like its all fact
TheSilphRoad,removed,or his phone is jacked in the way it takes screenshots i dont see this mess on my dex
TheSilphRoad,removed,they already have a bigger edge the pocket mode can track the distance when the phone is locked the option to save the battery its a no
TheSilphRoad,removed,i figured it was going to be garbage honestly ive been waiting to upgrade from my pebble time so i might just likely wait for black friday and see what kind of awesome android wear smartwatch i can get i just need to find one that runs on android wear and is either water resistant or water proof
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah been hearing that for over a month not really soon when you start getting into monthlymultiple month territory
TheSilphRoad,removed,uunidans lol he was a great content creator even though he apparently made a million accounts
TheSilphRoad,removed,how did you originally source this data would love to play around with something similar for my own city
TheSilphRoad,removed,so if i wanted to do this for my city duluth how would i go about doing this
TheSilphRoad,removed,removed
TheSilphRoad,removed,amen to that
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont upvote upvoted
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres hoping they secretly realised blocking root was a bad idea and secretly reverted the change
TheSilphRoad,removed,when the money is calling they are quite fast huh probably had some issues with customers purchasing the pogo and now they are sprinting
TheSilphRoad,removed,positive i have scanners running on different nests and none are showing anything peculiar
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope they add a lapras nest in my living room
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am javing gps errors after downloading do not recommend
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,so uh did they decide to let root users play again jk wishful thinking
TheSilphRoad,removed,im very much convince that minor text fixes is updated anticheating detector well played niantic now give it back to nintendogame freak
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah real hard to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one cares about plus niantic sort your god dam game out first
TheSilphRoad,removed,new patch omg let me be the first dae feels like catch rates got worse this last patch
TheSilphRoad,removed,its just an easy way for them to get upvotes nowadays
TheSilphRoad,removed,because people are predictable
TheSilphRoad,removed,i see your reverse psychology is working
TheSilphRoad,removed,you do know what iv and ev are do you
TheSilphRoad,removed,he deleted it any reasons why
TheSilphRoad,removed,did you scroll to the very bottom likely not
TheSilphRoad,removed,whining poohc
TheSilphRoad,removed,can you try to be less strict about the use of psa
TheSilphRoad,removed,wat
TheSilphRoad,removed,this could only end well
TheSilphRoad,removed,kill yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,quitedand you are in collegehelp us god please
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that explains why they havent released the update yet people pointed out how pointless the feature is so now theyre scrambling to make it somewhat useful lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,next week update from niantic will be about the million users million of which will be waiting for the next update
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that makes too much sense so theres no way itll happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah yes us pesky android users and our gps spoofing why would we even dare ask for a convenient smart watch app
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really dont understand the lack of communication with their players it doesnt build up hype it just pisses us off
TheSilphRoad,removed,bubblestrat is for noobs who suck or botters which are you im guessing botter so reported just to be safe
TheSilphRoad,removed,just poor design
TheSilphRoad,removed,like nothing lol we also get super mario run first apple is life
TheSilphRoad,removed,why give it to you for free if they can get you to pay for it or encourage you to battle gyms more by level you should be tanking gyms fairly easily
TheSilphRoad,removed,im going to be upset if it doesnt happen till then
TheSilphRoad,removed,im going to be more than upset i honestly wouldnt be surprised if they pull a fast one on us and make the buddy system update exclusive to plus users until they drop the tradingtracking update next update corrects minor text issues
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not this game is borderline unplayable i pop it open when im walking around to hatch eggs and if it buzzes in my pocket ill catch a mon once in a while
TheSilphRoad,removed,im terrified its a guaranteed capture also terrified its an ai just throwing balls straight at the pokemon until its either caught or runs at least if it is the second i can justify not getting one
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsfastpokemapse
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am using pokefast it does not require me to input my account i know it is cheating but i will not stop until they fix the current tracking i missed a nidoking by relying to the current tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,go map radar the android app its just a scanner and it takes forever but its accurate and includes despawn time
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic isnt known for putting out products and updates with problems lol if they do they dostill putting my money down on or around not buying the go ill wait for the apple app
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i for one would be incredibly pissed if it was an auto catch meaning that this would be just another way this game would be pay to win
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is a severe dearth of information regarding the specifics of how the device will function and interact with the game i know it will sell like hotcakes anyway but its really not sufficient for anyone to make an informed decision about purchasing the product poor
TheSilphRoad,removed,an app can easily do what the plus is doing
TheSilphRoad,removed,no we dont need more moanings and shitposts that is why people move to here
TheSilphRoad,removed,i fux with it
TheSilphRoad,removed,so you really need to have both to get the full pogo experience if i need both i may as well just take out my phone
TheSilphRoad,removed,youll even be able to collect new items just by clicking the pokémon go plus exclusive items i hope not
TheSilphRoad,removed,you mean not yet released
TheSilphRoad,removed,i want to catch them all
TheSilphRoad,removed,my bet is on it just pulling the data from the phone leaving everyone with the broken range counter
TheSilphRoad,removed,surely the top reason to get one is to save battery life as app can run in the background but it then doesnt track distance waste of money for that reason alone
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill just wait for the knockoff versions
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was all about this when i was reading up on the appwatch way before pogo was released but now after all thats happened and the way niantic has been running things im gonna sit this one out i have trust in the company at the moment
TheSilphRoad,removed,compatible with android devices that have gb ram or more and here die my hope
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think those features are included but will be removed two weeks after release
TheSilphRoad,removed,if the features i desperately want like running the app in the background are going to require separate hardware for no reason other than to make niantic money i will be out
TheSilphRoad,removed,ahahah different subreddit but same idiot
TheSilphRoad,removed,why not release the game in russia first
TheSilphRoad,removed,geez how many gazebos do you shemales need
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only way i can see people buying this is if they do a special promotion for it like you get a ditto or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,basically just throws straight balls the same way the bot programs do it will utterly useless after lvl
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyre too busy working on an app for a watch that the majority of their users probably dont even have
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is great and all but maybe they could release this buddy update they keep announcing new features but still no updates
TheSilphRoad,removed,it looks ugly af no matter how useful it turn out to be you can take your pride out of the equation if youre willing to put this on your wrist
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh so its useless
TheSilphRoad,removed,i still cant get over the fact that some people are more willing to shill out than just yknow look at the phone
TheSilphRoad,removed,per a previous comment so distance tracking is done solely by the smartphone and only when running in the foreground but if you just want to spin pokestops and throw balls at pokemon who are already in your dex the pogo plus will work great for you source httpswwwnintendocomaugoplus if i have to have my phone out and on to track my distance whats the point the convenience starts to be lost doesnt it
TheSilphRoad,removed,while i somewhat understand the move this revised statement makes the capture even the most elusive pokémon a bit of a slap in the face fortunately cases where this would mean a missed pokedex entry are few and far between for a lot of folks at this stage even out here in the boonies ive caught
TheSilphRoad,removed,didnt know your weeks had days
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate that crap there is bridge with a gym you can look both ways and below there are no boats at so when i take the gym and this spoofer doypac take it i know hes spoofing doypac was a level and had dragonites on all the gyms the first few weeks
TheSilphRoad,removed,too late
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokémon go does not track distance walked when running in the background that sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,basically this is a useless gimmick then
TheSilphRoad,removed,this things sounds wack sounds like paytocheat
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this literally takes the skill out of catching something by allowing you to just push a button to catch something i dont care if you already have the pokemon or not that sounds alot like cheating how bout dont play pokemon go if you cant actively have your phone out next thing you know theyll start making cars with the same technology built into the steering wheel that allows you play while driving better yet why not add a feature where you just have the game automatically catch and spin everything for you even if the games not open dont even get me started on how stupid everyones gonna look with a big plastic pokeball on their damn wrists im all about the idea of using apple watches to enhanceextend the game experience but not in a way that alters the mechanics of the game for you to make it easier its just sad the time and resources they wasted on this couldveshouldve been devoted towards fixing any one of the problems this game still has like gym sniping gym lagcrashing when multiple people are battling boosting up type advantages so they actually make sense etc
TheSilphRoad,removed,useless then guess im canceling my order then was realy hoping for a fitbit way to track movement
TheSilphRoad,removed,wouldnt put it past nianticnintendo to add additional functions and features introducing the pokémon go plus
TheSilphRoad,removed,i already told my local page id run down one of the busiest street in nothing but a pikachu speedo if did this on release i really want it but
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope they factor in chances to miss the throw otherwise thats absolute bs for everyone not using a go plus
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant wait for when this comes out so someone can actually explain exactly what this does and how it works since you know nintendo and niantic cant seem to do it
TheSilphRoad,removed,itt confirmation bias as always when this is asked all opposing posts downvoted sounds about right
TheSilphRoad,removed,what happened to the walking with friends update
TheSilphRoad,removed,awesome work thanks for sharing i am sure many people here would make good use of this data grateful
TheSilphRoad,removed,mind checking this against all the jost spawn points i found in unfortunately i didnt think to check for gastly cycles myself during my scans as i hadnt even seen this thread until long after i did my spawn checks
TheSilphRoad,removed,if only they didnt let the game fall off so badly
TheSilphRoad,removed,not worth
TheSilphRoad,removed,if ball throwing is going to be a permanent playstyle instead of actually fighting pokemon u enounter im suddenly disappointed in the direction of this game we arent trainers at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,no youre the only one with this issues oh no wait there has been numerous threads about this in the past two weeks since the last update
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh a reminder to cancel my order
TheSilphRoad,removed,confirmed the tauros i had trapped in a gym in insadong seoul just came back to me after two months i guess he was getting ronery
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can confirm that botting in front of computer can be equally if not more fun than playing legit you can see it once you try it
TheSilphRoad,removed,spoofing wasnt effected just came to say im loving your gyms still
TheSilphRoad,removed,you forgot respect
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpimgurcomgallerygtrhc
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think you mean alternative fact
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a terrible post
TheSilphRoad,removed,welcome to our society but i have loads of money so why should i pay tax some people with cash seem to think money buys them the right to do and act as they please
TheSilphRoad,removed,fake whoa whoa slow down there terms like those can hurt please use the patriotically correct pc term with a little effort we can make america a safer space for patriotic discourse see this for more
TheSilphRoad,removed,it went downhill incredibly quick when the game launched so grateful for this place
TheSilphRoad,removed,fake whoa whoa slow down there terms like those can hurt please use the patriotically correct pc term with a little effort we can make america a safer space for patriotic discourse see this for more
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly didnt take long for it to just become a whinefest where every third comment is basically someone saying that theyre going to quit but they make sure to stick around and keep saying that at least if we complain about something here we also try to come up with constructive feedback
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one cares release gen oh sorry wrong thread
TheSilphRoad,removed,no i agree with you i have a bleeding edge quality phone and i was having the same thought yesterday that the games loading time had deteriorated to unacceptable levels and the bugs i encountered were too many and too frequent requiring a restart which took far too long i think this is due to niantic loading their servers with a whole bunch of stuff that they really need to just drop already whatever the reason is im with you and niantic is kind of a horrible company
TheSilphRoad,removed,also most of those bugs are months old they earn so much money that they shouldnt emberass themselves with such poor quality product
TheSilphRoad,removed,and if you want to whine and speculate theres always rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,spreading your cancer on two subreddits simultaneously arent we
TheSilphRoad,removed,because its technically incomplete and lazy
TheSilphRoad,removed,pogo is currently barely even pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait there are still working trackers and yes they shouldnt have the common pokemon on the tracker in my opinion
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is why i dont care when people spoof of you dont want balance youre in sf
TheSilphRoad,removed,trump is offtopic thats all if i want to read people bitching about politics ill log into facebook eyeroll
TheSilphRoad,removed,anything would be an improvement we have gyms pokéstops and thats it in a world as developed as the pokémon world there should be more interactivity
TheSilphRoad,removed,i posted this in rpokemongo it was removed because it wasnt pokemon go related
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one thought to look when they werent found in the demo until now anyways
TheSilphRoad,removed,people dont really appreciate scanners in this sub so you may wanna refrain from posting stuff like this that being said hunting with scanners is really fun and brings the game experience to a whole new level arguably where it should be
TheSilphRoad,removed,it also showed me just how bad the sightings system is rare mons either failed to show up at all even when from a stop or didnt show up until you were on top of them please niantic if you want the ingame tracker to be usable tell us about the lapras away not the pidgey next to us and here you hit exactly the real problem
TheSilphRoad,removed,and
TheSilphRoad,removed,which city wide map ive seen one for vegas are there others
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep i had fun when i found pokevision but then i started relying on it more and more to the point that i never went out hunting anymore just checked the map from time to time and went out to catch whatever seemed interesting when it stopped working and i had to track pokemon myself i started having fun again i actually miss sightings and i think the new tracker is too much like those scanners triangulating a pokemons location was half the fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,aww people arent posting anymore it was fun reading comments from people
TheSilphRoad,removed,gymhuntr com is an unofficial tracking site
TheSilphRoad,removed,op is that guy who calls the hotel manager when the person enters the pool and exceeds the pool capacity
TheSilphRoad,removed,pikasanta is phonetically equal to saint dck in portuguese i wouldnt say its appropriate obs i dont know how to comment the original post
TheSilphRoad,removed,someone let a year old on the internet again
TheSilphRoad,removed,has this place become rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh shit sorry i must have had a stroke i swear it was hours lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,autowalk feature in tutuapp is solving that problem for me right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,its more about the politics using islam as a reason the government of indonesia malaysia and brunei are run by many if not majority of muslims and though small groups of super conservatives have talked about joining saudi no bans have actually been put in place because its just a fucking game maybe if their government actually cares theyd be getting rid of the cancerous muslims and rebuilding the countries instead of removing pokemons from the country
TheSilphRoad,removed,guys if you want to read about more pokemon stuff in general follow these guys i just found them
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol this guys too content with fashion im waiting for double xpstardustcandies or something core content not cash shop a buy incubators christmas event would be notably one of the stingiest events they could pull in the season of giving lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,gayness overload
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah its been awfully rpokemongo in here lately
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you live under a rock
TheSilphRoad,removed,guysi just caught a ratatta is this legit please help
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems to be a correlation between general pleasantness of the country and when pogo was released democracies first hybrid regimes later
TheSilphRoad,removed,no you are the chosen one
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a christmas miracle
TheSilphRoad,removed,its looking like the same pool of moves will dictate all the moves so far meaning nothing new meaning a whole lotta garbage coming
TheSilphRoad,removed,should so far theyre not really doing a good job of paralleling the handheld games
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like the part where they spent a month on an update to remove an s sometimes i wonder if theyre even really doing anything or trying to make this game cooler it feels more like theyre just thinking up ways to make new cash grabs while recycling content and minimizing actual need to work
TheSilphRoad,removed,how will a nonshiny become shiny doubt it
TheSilphRoad,removed,fuck
TheSilphRoad,removed,you sound like a douche from quebec checks out
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh no re the dental work but at least it got you a chansey and dragonite win win right haha i hope youre feeling better i feel so bad i knew about walmart being awesome and i never thought to share that news my son was obsessed with going almost daily to look at fishing supplies and i happily said yes because of all the pokémon i could find in the parking lot there so since i feel bad not mentioning that i will share the other good spot and potential good spot i know of look up the road albantowne way in edgewood its a small not fancy neighborhood that is sort of on the way to flying point park closed in the winter i found this by accident when trying to find a ponyta nest and my friend from work and i go at least once a week and probably creep out the people who live there like crazy but we always find a bunch of not super common things there used to be tons of geodudesmagnets voltorbs lately weve found several manchop sheldor im sure you have plenty from hdg though monkey cat kabuto although sadly not enough yet for me to evolve him rhynos found an evolved form my verizon phone loses connection there a lot but my friends t mobile doesnt so one day there was both a lickitung and a dragonaire both of which i needed for my pokedex and i couldnt get my phone to connect and missed out on both of them while she caught them but did get a lickitung the friday after so i got over that loss eventually haha still missing a dragonair but could evolve my candies just being stingy hoping someday ill magically have enough for a dragonite did find one in the wild in nj once although he sucks we also found similar pokémon in a neighborhood called trimble woods in edgewood off trimble road there is just one culdesac that has interesting things and then we drive to the back of the neighborhood and have found a machoke that is near a church in the back of this area but thats all in edgewood i suspect but dont know but think that the neighborhood which is on the other side not side of the train tracks that are in aberdeen by the walmart might have stuff like this too i remember when i first heard about pokevision i had looked at it a few times and always there were cool things near there i never went over then but have seen better sightings there while sitting at my sons cub scout meetings than i normally see while sitting somewhere someday i might drive around there but never have done so yet so ha i guess that means i must not suspect it that much because i definitely drive thought the edgewood areas plenty they probably are on the edge of calling the police on me oh well its not like im really doing anything wrong anyway i hope we get great nests again in harford even if theyre not at hdg at least somewhere close i suppose the abraomanyte spoiled me too much im keeping my fingers crossed ps they better keep the hats on the pikachu well all be mad again if they remove them
TheSilphRoad,removed,when you want to be the first to post something so you just post it hours early
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyre not going to make old not shiny but new shiny if they havent gotten rid of legacy movesets i dont know why you think they would ever retroactively make existing pokemon shiny even if they tie it to ivs theyd have to be idiots to code it in such a way that existing pokemon of a certain iv become shiny any tiny change to the shiny mechanic would risk taking away the shiny attribute from existing pokemon people would flip their shit updates like shiny pokemon are also a way to pull lapsed hardcore players back into the game if they give them freebies based on their existing collection they sacrifice some of that benefit for no reason
TheSilphRoad,removed,spawn times increased to hour all the spawn times showing on the tracker after midnight are now for an hour
TheSilphRoad,removed,my balls are super itchy atm like idk why maybe a rash
TheSilphRoad,removed,tipthere is an app where you can track pokemon after new sightings update it is called pokemon tracking in the google play store it does not give the exact location but uses strategicly placed circles after walking to locate pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,hopefully never
TheSilphRoad,removed,all these less than changes are so pointless do they even understand how their own game works their change for gengar that already suffers from terrible hp and defense by giving it increase wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow put so much into my iv gengar only to have niantic buff him with an unattainable move definitely closest ive come to quitting
TheSilphRoad,removed,my dick is out pressing f for respects
TheSilphRoad,removed,the seel change is unbelievably stupid seriously i can just imagine the ceo of niantic saying hey he has his tongue out lets give him lick i mean after all this is the same man who literally wanted to completely take evolution out of the game because he thought it would be too complicated for players
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes because i will fly out to your location and watch you masturabate through your window blinds when your parents are asleep its not like they spawn in your drive way every night nest are normally in public areas so you can rest safely knowing we wont be raping you at night quit being gay and give us a nearby landmark or stfu
TheSilphRoad,removed,that site has an ad for an article on how to evolve eevee into espeon and umbreon at night
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive asked the people at pogodev to look and all they say is but you have to hatch the egg anyway so who cares they dont realise not everyone uses blue incubators and might want to prioritise their eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,a long time ago probably over a month now im not hunting a source
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow a lot of that list is horrible and makes no sense omastar gets a ground move instead of a rock type move now even though he is rockwater poison type monsters get ghost type moves and they remove poison moves seel also gets a ghost type move instead of a water type move ugh
TheSilphRoad,removed,nigga eat a dick
TheSilphRoad,removed,rekt
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey idiot this post was about an infographic for counters to defenders generally
TheSilphRoad,removed,three steps ahead of that stupid subreddit guys please put me in jail for being infected with the disease
TheSilphRoad,removed,stupidity has to hurt
TheSilphRoad,removed,psa psa psa reddit loves unnessesarly putting psa in front of things
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok how long are we going to wait for the nests this is ridiculous
TheSilphRoad,removed,i eagerly logged in thinking that suddenly my psybeam starmies would suddenly stop sucking but apparently this just affects newlyacquired pokemon nice what a massive fu to everyone who already has the ones with horrible moves that really sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,existing pokemon arent affected only those obtained moving forward i cant get over what a horrible decision that is im at level and ive done so much work getting so many of the gen i pokemon what do i care if future ones have better moves im over gen i im looking forward to gen ii already really its my psybeam starmies that are just depressing to even look at not getting hydro pump was bad enough but knowing that no one else has to deal with psybeam makes me want to just transfer them right now what a bummer
TheSilphRoad,removed,shows this game still needs a lot of work and optimization we are well overdue an update
TheSilphRoad,removed,since the game launched ive made it a mission to get a venusaur as quickly as possible choosing bulbasaur as my starter the day after i finally evolved my ivysaur is when i was introduced to the online iv calcs and i was pretty disappointed with what venusaur had for ivs since then ive captured more bulbasaur and ivysaur checking each ones ivs its been continuous disappointment after or so catches with my average being below average frustrating i began recording the ivs the image is the latest update i havent recorded lvl cp or hp which could be useful but really its only the perfect that matters such ancillary data would only be useful for others that may wish to verify the s regardless this is terrible luck and though only catches are presented ive checked the ivs of nearly pokemon way more than enough for any trends to have emerged the only clear pattern i can see is that wild pokemon of my starters species have consistently had below average stats is anyone else experiencing similar results or is this just terrible terrible luck i have hatched bulbasaur and am still waiting for one to tldr is this terrible luck or do wild pokemon of your starters species have suppressed stats
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been nose deep on this subject for years trust me
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we have npcs or maybe fix gyms so theyre not imbalanced and mostly pointless or maybe just change a few random moves for no reason thatll do niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just got the email hype
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its a gangrape on persian
TheSilphRoad,removed,ingress has playercreated quests they incorporate hacking chosen portals in random or specified order some quests have a theme for example in my town theres a quest to hack all portals that are on churches or wall paintings after completion you are awarded the quest badge and what was cool about them is that some quests are made into series if you complete them in order the badges form a mosaic on your player profile if niantic had moved all the portals into pogo and not just of them the quests couldve been transferred into pogo as well however with the missing portals they would be broken though i dont see the reason why this idea couldnt be incorporated now the problem is exactly what you said in the end the game has too much potential niantic is too lazy and has not enough people working on the game especially considering its size even if they wanted to introduce the same quest system as in ingress they would end up flooded with submissions its the same reason why portal submission is suspended they were receiving too many of them and they had not enough reviewers my portal submission got accepted after half a year of waiting i find it both frustrating and disappointing how the potential of this game is wasted because the developer declines to make progress they made the biggest amount of money out of all mobile games last year and theyre still a tiny studio and i dont get it why nintendo doesnt push niantic to do better
TheSilphRoad,removed,why would you two want to make it more difficult to prestige its already a pain in the arse it should be easier not harder
TheSilphRoad,removed,lifes not fair quit crying
TheSilphRoad,removed,do nothing with spoofers and cheaters punish legit players who just play game while exercise this company is worst thing for this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,f you
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont get it
TheSilphRoad,removed,god i cant wait for this to go away there is no link
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is another problem if it is somehow looked at as acceptable to ignore one game for the other flip flopping their attention back and forth plenty of companies have several games they manage they have dedicated teams to each game not one team that rotates from game to game with time after time of stagnation and this is just another issue among the laundry list of gripes to have with the management of this game this company is a comedy of errors
TheSilphRoad,removed,how about you start by pulling the stick outta your ass let them play the damn game
TheSilphRoad,removed,jesus christ you are impatient days is nothing for any company why do you need to hear from them every day got nothing better to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,downvote for humblebrag
TheSilphRoad,removed,the tracking is still a big issue for me cant tell you how many hours ive spent trying to unsuccessfully hut down a pokemon that appeared on my radar now most of the time i dont even bother going out of my way trying to find something on the radar either i run into it or i dont being a rural player this means my gf and i have to drive almost minutes to the nearest town that actually has stops in it and spend an hour or two walking in a loop to hit all the stops only to catch common candy trash pokemon it wasnt worth it in the summer but at least we got to take a nice walk talk and enjoy the sights and sounds now that winter is coming there is no incentive neither of us wants to walk around in the miserable cold for nothing no thank you
TheSilphRoad,removed,this i imagine this will further unbalance ruralcity amounts for a while until they lower level necessary
TheSilphRoad,removed,so basically places where ingress was a thing will have even more stuff and places like here where ingress was never even on the radar will get squat
TheSilphRoad,removed,the new hub will start in san francisco before rolling out to other areas thats pretty big news san francisco is in real need of new pokestops
TheSilphRoad,removed,why is ingress an importance to pokemon go because pokemon go is a re skinned version of ingress
TheSilphRoad,removed,typical niantic hey looks like pokemon go players have some requests who should be get to help assist in this i know lets get players from a totally different game who have no fn idea and probably dont give a flying fsck about pokemon to help i have never seen a company so out of touch with its player base before
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah cities just have so much stuff i was in tokyo during the pogo launch their parks are stacked with stops they have so many interesting things in those parks like bench bench bench and even bench some even have street light street light and street light quite a few had bike stand bike stand and so on i am not suggesting that ruralsuburban areas have as many attractions that would qualify for stops as cities but the sheer amount of everyday things that qualify for a stop in cities but not in suburban and rural areas is just completely annoying in tokyo and other big cities almost anything can be a stop whereas in rural and suburban areas not even actual attractions are a stop
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats niantics issue in how they choose which portals are going to be pokestops gyms or not used yes niantic actually does implement speed caps in ingress its a common feature in both games that has ruined the platform
TheSilphRoad,removed,that sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol niantic a possible security measure against botters that nobody even knew about
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is telling you that youve completed the game you dont need to play anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats not cool at all not cause of the error but because there is no in game notification to tell you why this is happening niantic should have at least thrown a message your way like stop cheating or get a life something that at least tells you why youre getting shafted
TheSilphRoad,removed,remember kids no trespassing on the sun or well ban you from gyms niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,this would be just like nms niantic is saying get a new account start over games these days just arent the same
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are clearly cheating that is why
TheSilphRoad,removed,this
TheSilphRoad,removed,you would think that niantic would have noticed that players start to reach lvl this just shows that they dont care about this game as much as we do
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is it this is the endgame one final f▮▮▮ you from niantic congrats
TheSilphRoad,removed,level from legit play already hmm ok not saying you cheated but seems kinda odd tbh
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor text fixes to the actual code
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon go until you hit level cap then pokemon stop you win
TheSilphRoad,removed,even if legit no one really cares about them especially niantic anyone can poor money into a game to get ahead tell me when the first free player reaches level now thats impressive
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao ultimate fock you from niantic they just love screwing around with their user base apparently
TheSilphRoad,removed,still better than the ending of no mans sky
TheSilphRoad,removed,why would you make going into a gym memory leak i dont know but here we are
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is the reason you want to mess with gyms for now is the time you need to be focusing on catching pokemon for more stardust and for better mons gyms shouldnt even be on your mind and if you already got gyms then im glad they kicked you out please dont tell me you are already in gyms bro
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can use this httpspokeassistantcommainivcalculator there is a slider with level that can be adjusted according to what you need than in the table below you will see what is the maximum cp for that pokemon and what is your pokemons cp going to be at that level
TheSilphRoad,removed,i guess they took some inspiration from no mans sky
TheSilphRoad,removed,except it was wrong that time
TheSilphRoad,removed,we need to blow up pokemongoapp on twitter with this issue until they respond
TheSilphRoad,removed,really glad i didnt put in all that time for level ill stick with level for now until they fix this issue sheesh kappa
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a programmer i keep getting amazed how niantic has such a juniorleveled team
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only thing that should be done is flood niantic with complaints if people are true legit flood them to let them know of the error even for those who are not those levels and get the error flood them this way they can realize something is jacked up half the problem i see with this game is when people encounter errors they flood their facebook twitter or shitpost on reddit about the problems versus contacting niantic they cant fix things they dont know about or only thinking it affects user out of the entire pogo gaming population
TheSilphRoad,removed,try rooting your phone itll fix it
TheSilphRoad,removed,serves you right cheater legit level
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,this isnt new information its been known for or weeks atleast
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,not really i havent submitted reports to silph in months because it hangs on my phone when i select authenticate i hope the mobile app comes out soon so i can submit reports and help out the community although if fpm starts releasing his collected spawn info to worldopole that might moot reporting completely
TheSilphRoad,removed,you moms vagina
TheSilphRoad,removed,for completely ignoring their player base for making a game about tracking down pokemon and then taking the tracking down part out without saying as much as working on it instead they patch the footsteps out as if trying to cover up that the fun part of the game was there to begin with
TheSilphRoad,removed,they are talking and who the hell cares about who mans the pr let alone soulja fuckboi
TheSilphRoad,removed,so they decided to ruin the game because some people are stupid instead of you knowjust not spawning pokemon in private places
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres a greek joke in there somewhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry i shouldve clarified that account is managed by a party pr company that gets spoon fed information about certain issues and events when something goes wrong niantic is busy fixing that and the pr guy keeps quiet to play it safe not saying i agree with any of this but this is whats going on reposted because triggered comment filter
TheSilphRoad,removed,or maybe you shouldnt be a little whiner who flames entire communities as toxic just saying
TheSilphRoad,removed,i did something similar digitally i took a screen shot of a poke so i would have the size and shape of the screen as it appears while im playing then emailed that to my desktop and then took a screen shot of the arc on silph road in photoshopgimp run the opacity down so you can make the overlay layer the correct size of the arc as it appears on your phone then email back to your phone and set the arc with hash marks as your home screen then simply hold a nonconductive item such as a pencil over the pokemons level in the pokedex and hit your home button voila this could be player sourced specific to phone screen ratios i have the correct arc for and about to make it for super ugly but i will attempt to upload one as an example
TheSilphRoad,removed,tldr please we dont need your backstory just give us information
TheSilphRoad,removed,why post this who in all honesty cares that you by the way who are you posted in a stupid sub in a stupid post on a stupid thread if you really want to apologize then do it in that thread and address the actual people you offended or were rude to anything otherwise is furthering your selfish motives and selfish actions have you ever heard of the phrase selfrighteous indignation thats you in a nutshell get over yourself no one knows you no one will call your cell phone if you dont post in a month no one subscribes to your youtube channel no one donates to your kickstarter or we just stop karmawhoring seriously stop being such a self absorbed individual did you learn something great write about it in your journal doug then go talk to skeeter about how big your nose is and that patty will get her eye poked out when she opens your stupid graduation picture
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was able to gps spoof by putting a loaded gun to my head and pulling the trigger
TheSilphRoad,removed,no but the new catching mechanics pretty much it that way
TheSilphRoad,removed,they clearly dont give a fuk about people outside nyc and san francisco where there are pokestops and gyms every feet the fact they didnt algorithmically generate regular pokestops in places that have no submissions and better spawn rates everywhere is just a joke
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe its because im a longtime ingress player so i didnt expect things like customer support from niantic in the first place but it just looks to me like people are just pissed by niantic took away a major way people were cheating or at least made it more difficult and a feature is gone likely temporarily for that its all btching all the time from so many entitled people
TheSilphRoad,removed,i honestly dont think the curveball got any harder but ive been using it for weeks now
TheSilphRoad,removed,ice is ineffective against water smartass
TheSilphRoad,removed,they blocked them by turning off all useful location information the reason why everything shows up without the footprints is because they literally arent giving anyone distance information
TheSilphRoad,removed,well maybe you need to learn how to search im not hating im sick and tired of the same bullshit being said over and over in fact now your hating because you dont like my comment boohoo
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi my name is theron lewis im the owner of funzilla a us cell phone case manufacturing company and a former pokemon go beta tester and im posting because i need your help before we roll out a new pokemon go product to be honest im a little nervous about how this product will be received if you take a couple seconds to give me your opinion and help me ease my mind about it ill let you in on the limited preorder discount for the product in question only if you would like it though being a pokemaniac and and former beta tester during the pokemon go beta i knew immediately we had to create this product weve spent the last two months developing these premium super durable battery cases made to look like pokedexes with team logos on them and were really excited about releasing them to the public im a little nervous though because weve been working on these for so long and forgot to get market feedback from anyone outside our company on the designs we based the design off of mophie cases and where we saw fit tried to improve on the mophie cases shortcomings we think we did a great job but sometimes when youre too close to a project you dont see its flaws thats where you come in reddit ive seen the finished products in person and they look absolutely beautiful to me but as were going to be rolling this project out worldwide i want to make sure other people think that too so to test out the market just give me your opinion here and id love to find out what you think it would be invaluable to us and id be forever grateful note this is not some sneaky way to sell this product over reddit i honestly want your genuine opinion there isnt even a way to buy the cases on the site im linking we havent even enabled it to take payment yet and the buy buttons dont work i just want to know if this looks like something you would genuinely buy and in return if you do want to buy it no pressure not trying to make any sales here ill give you the heavily discounted preorder price that were only offering to a few thousand people before we roll them out at worldwide as a thank you for helping us with this project heres the link thanks so much for your help
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really dont get that though ive played games for decades and never have i ever needed the makers of the games to talk to me about them i just dont feel entitled to answers im not even sure they have at this point will the tracking system come back i have no idea and dont know if they know either either way i dont feel entitled to be kept in the loop every step of the way ive loved the game so far and im loving it right now as it is people who are so upset by this lack of communication and are seeking to punish niantic by requesting refunds and such should consider that if they cant enjoy the game at all as it is they probably wont be happy with it in the future either
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow can you get any more fickle sorry my bad you seem to be part of the now i want it now generation is fine if you are walking
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,this has been discussed
TheSilphRoad,removed,nobodys gonna mention the mistake in the post i thought this was reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,there has never before been a game with a player base this large niantic is navigating mostly unknown territory absolutely and trying the best they can not to utterly eff it all up you have no way to prove that for all you know they have the concern level of a player who already reached the end zone
TheSilphRoad,removed,there was a time where that would have been acceptable that time has long passed
TheSilphRoad,removed,try google
TheSilphRoad,removed,why dont people realize the midatlantic is a real thing a lot of areas dont identify at all as the south or north east
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah really nothing has been changed pretty useless in the long run
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor
TheSilphRoad,removed,it was to reset the bad ratings but ofc we give one star again
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems accurate i gots a custom api map trackin thingy for backup incase this one gets f by niatic
TheSilphRoad,removed,or suing the gun manufacturer when someone buys a gun a shoots up a school oh wait they already do that in the united states
TheSilphRoad,removed,make sure to upgrade and rereview i guess i want them to see those
TheSilphRoad,removed,where are the codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,they stated that the hype was unexpected though the only reason for their nonexistent communication would be if everyone in their company was illiterate which seen from this picture is clearly not the case
TheSilphRoad,removed,interesting enough as a question but somewhat irrelevant as thats not what happened
TheSilphRoad,removed,being in rural areas means you get some pokemon but no pokestops so without iaps you cant get pokeballs or incense which is one of the only ways to find more than a handful of pokemon per day rurally so we are the number one candidate to sell iaps to actually
TheSilphRoad,removed,the max cp for victreebel is also if you want to share normalfag videos go to pokemongo instead of thesilphroad
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think its a tactic to make minor changes so the negative star ratings are not seen for the latest update on the app store
TheSilphRoad,removed,just another example of just how screwed up niantics priorities are
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats cool report back in a couple weeks and let us know how your friend hates the game and doesnt play anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,well if thats the case i just left a review for them
TheSilphRoad,removed,funny how the last days you guys have been acting like you are better than the people in that sub makes everyone in this sub look like ds tbh
TheSilphRoad,removed,okay i can handle them removing the steps because its been broken already and hankering down on tracker sites because it maybe best for the game long term doing both of those at the same time leaving everyone nearly blind and even their radio silence because if they somehow provide results in the end ill be content and i had hope theyll finally find a guy to communicate for them and itll be better in the future but if they actually do have a global community manager i cant say im not a little steamed that the guy who is supposed to be communicating isnt doing just that
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope so not worth bringing the shitposts and cancer to this place
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think that actually makes me more angry if this guy is real not only is he not doing his damn job but we were all under the impression that they were scrambling to find one there is zero slack i can give niantic if they are refusing to make their cm stop these fires
TheSilphRoad,removed,uh i sure hope thats not true they would be venturing into obvious territory if they let you buy rare spawns not the best time for that type of pr
TheSilphRoad,removed,wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont bother with that sub if you want actual information about the game theres just too many shitposts
TheSilphRoad,removed,that place is just a bunch of entitled brats who are crying because its not as easy to cheat right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah falls under moba too p ill throw hots in there as well as much as people love to pretend it isnt toxic its not quite as bad as lol but its still worse than any nonmoba game ive played no idea how smite is though
TheSilphRoad,removed,guess hell be tracking for a while now the steps are gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,so i need to create a ptc account to use this app
TheSilphRoad,removed,its alpha but its pretty damn bad for an alpha indeed
TheSilphRoad,removed,im really glad for a place to discuss the game and have a positive attitude about it the main pokemon go subreddit is such a disturbing scene right now the sense of entitlement and constant whining makes me want to seriously take a break from the internet
TheSilphRoad,removed,every community serves a purpose but while your here we hope you enjoy what we have to offer 😆 youtubecomc teamatlasgo
TheSilphRoad,removed,the dichotomy between the two subs immediately reminded me of the episode of south park when cartman goes back in time to see the signing of the declaration of independence its pretty entertaining to me tbh rthesilphroad constantly berated rpokemongo for being hotheaded and toxic while themselves in my opinion are a bit too complacent i believe a little action is necessary to hopefully get niantic to respond and rpokemongo has lit a huge fire under niantic butt on the other hand people want a place for constructive criticism and calm collected discussion and rthesilphroad delivers that the other sub can indeed get a bit too rowdy and that in turn leads to more hivemind oriented discussion i kinda dont get why either sub has to put down the other in saying theirs is more mature or that its better or less toxic id say at this point all the sister subs are pretty necessary
TheSilphRoad,removed,but theres no way to force an encounter without tracking it down if youre in the city you get tons of battles just going down the street but if youre stuck in a small area or in a ruralsuburban area you needed the tracker to have a fair chance at actually encountering anything much less good stuff there is no reason to tell you something is nearby if youre unlikely to be able to find it id rather they just make rarer pokemon more likely to run away to effectively make them harder to catch than to make it harder by hiding necessary information to engaging them
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,wut
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats the matter cat got your tongue so youve realized how idiotic you were being congrats on the first steps to selfacceptance
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was wondering that as well i was in rpokemongo noticed the shitstorm decided i needed to come here quick and realized the link was gone my first thought was well rthesilphroad probably isnt on the hate train so the booted them off the list with the childish mentality they have over there i dont doubt thats the reason at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe if niantic released a statement like this id trust them more right now i feel niantic are the worst company in the world due to their lack of any communication and transparency
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think they will they probably removed the while they fix it because theyd rather show nothing than showing steps that mean absolutely nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemons ive been so triggered by how many wrong plurals ive seen in the past weeks
TheSilphRoad,removed,completely unrelated reply go ucf
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh bullshit your carefully chosen words just show you have no idea what youre talking about do you forget that there is of hours of videos out there of people playing preupdate anyone with time on their hands can take that data yes visual observation counts as data and compare it with postupdate data people have been running bots preupdate and postupdate all of the information available so far has shown that at least the first three things you listed have indeed changed
TheSilphRoad,removed,i posted a thread about this concern a couple of days ago actually its pretty damn annoying i thought i was going crazy when i kept seeing the number of pokeballs skip by what makes it worse is that i even paid to get pokeballs never again hopefully niantic resolves this issue including all the other shit they need to fix
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats the first thing i thought when i was having very low cp pokemons break out and escape on the first ball or wasting raspberries and better pokeballs all on one pokemon to watch it run away after the try fucking money grab
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy shit usf
TheSilphRoad,removed,for me yes and its not even higher cp pokemon just the regular ones you normally catch i am starting to see newer pokemon i havent even seen yet but finding them is a bitch
TheSilphRoad,removed,why u dick ridin this guy lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,man the people in this sub really do have everything figured out silph already has its executives guys move along youre wrong btw
TheSilphRoad,removed,i made an account to tell you that youre fucking awesome really appreciate the time you spend making this app it works perfectly for me caught growlithes evees a nindoking and some other decent pokemon the best part is that its actually more fun than pokevision atleast you get a bit of the hunt
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a rural player for the summer anyway i strongly disagree with your positive i havent played much after the update but my brother went out for about an hour he bought pokéballs twice we have pokéstops in my town of inhabitants and the closest two are about km apart around miles of course the real problem is how rural players are fucked in so many ways i dont appreciate additional fuckage however before some unfucking occurs probably not gonna play much before i get back to my apartment in a city with inhabitants where there are something like pokéstops honestly cant afford the crazy amount of pokéballs im required to buy out here
TheSilphRoad,removed,i simply dont give a shit about defending a gym after all it will be gone in less than a minute when the spoofers realize one of their gyms is missing
TheSilphRoad,removed,duh
TheSilphRoad,removed,it blows my mind how the irony is lost on all the people on this sub who spew hateful vitriol at rpokemongo and then say how nice it is that that this sub is so free from hateful vitriol nasty words at another subreddit might be nicer than nasty words at niantic but come one there is still a lot of toxicity on this sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,the problem to me is that there is no game anymore with the tracker even with party scanners the game was getting to the pokemon in time with this update my choices are sit on my arse at lures or wander randomly and hope i come across a pokemon then you add in the changes to the catch rate and the general difficulty increase and its like ok so you dont give me any way to find the pokemon i need then when i do you make it extremely difficult for me to catch them where is the fun that and the complete and utter lack of communication is why i feel that niantic are getting everything they deserve id rather they fail and the license be given to someone who is semicompetent
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop being so fun with people that like the same game you like this is a serious forum for people playing a version of a childrens game please act accordingly
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats correct its android only
TheSilphRoad,removed,not even humble
TheSilphRoad,removed,got some help from heatmaps from a livetracker dev he register each and every spawn over the city with this he created heatmaps for each pokemon with spawn points and time i just have to select the heatmap for the most common pokemon of all pidgey and voila i can see all spawns in my city with time of activation
TheSilphRoad,removed,obvious spoofer is obvious eat a dick and gtfo
TheSilphRoad,removed,truth bot you could get there in less than a day
TheSilphRoad,removed,go awai botter
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can see if you sort by pokedex number that other than a few oddballs wild caught pokemon have the same or very close attack value as will their evolved forms since they are higher on the pokedex
TheSilphRoad,removed,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂dead
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol the companies you listed are just using ingress for cheap advertisement the difference between these companies and a mcdonalds is that they wont have hundreds of people flooding their stores and offices to do nothing other than play pokemon now add in the drunken assholes halfwits who want to start fights over pokestops and an over crowded restaurant with no place to park because of all the pokemon players yep thats going to go over really well with the people who are going to those establishment to actually buy something but i digress what do i know
TheSilphRoad,removed,rural players are still st out of luck this new tracker still doesnt show where the random spawns are if you dont live near a lot of stops dont bother looking for anything the disappearing footsteps were a better tracker for the days that they worked
TheSilphRoad,removed,pidgeys actually almost always have fyi
TheSilphRoad,removed,this particular pokemon has specific ivs most of what you hatch or find will have various possibilities
TheSilphRoad,removed,okay but how much dust and candy do you need to get that poliwag to level the pokeassistant calc doesnt tell you that
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have evolved starmie wghp but ive evolved gyarados are bitehp rng is a bitch lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a fair question there could be soooooo much more content
TheSilphRoad,removed,why should i i am not the developer was helping niantic with pics movies and reports from both factions still niantic givs mostly a shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one is cheating if they use a tracker theyre not violating the tos
TheSilphRoad,removed,using the tracker is not cheating it is similar to someone else telling you that a pokemon is there and you go catch it you still have to travel there physically which is the point of pokemon go but gps spoofing really is cheating because you catch all rare mons and take over gyms just by sitting at one place but a spoofer only cheats himself thou i would cheat in a exam to make a gradebut would not cheat in a gamebecause it takes all the fun away
TheSilphRoad,removed,hanke was only lv last we checked probably hasnt logged in in a while and certainly doesnt own a go
TheSilphRoad,removed,in all honesty as much as this insanely hard to prove i have noticed very odd spawn node spawns and in a very few specific situations i cant help but feel i directly impacted the spawn pattern simply due to my presence or by the impact of other clusters of players moving into an area now i dont really see tons of evolved pokemon everywhere i go but at level there have been some freakin crazy random situations where i enter an area not close to my house and i look at my phone and uh snorlax wtf and when i ran a scanner like with that snorlax it had spawned seconds before i scanned it this directly coincided with my range to the spawn meters basicly i claim that as a higher level player enters an area one that is not frequented or has not been recently there could be a higher chance of a higher tier pokemon to spawn this is exactly how i caught my first dragonite completely random just leaving a park and checked my nearby near a call center just down the road and saw the silhouette i spent minutes trying to catch it finally did and then swapped to my daughters account who was with me and the thing was still there meaning the dragonite spawned with seconds of me entering the area given this is not a hard fact but i honestly feel especially after using a scanner for the better part of months spawn node activity has some sort of correlation to player movement
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont understand how you got this i have a slowbro with water gun and a with confusion the one is a consistently better attacker did you take into account which moves are faster
TheSilphRoad,removed,zombie bug neverheard of it always glitch zombie bug sounds mega dumb
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not impossible some people are just lucky maybe its an error in the code because random encounters they might fix this so low levels cant just strangle hold a gym by getting lucky
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is such a not new news omg does anyone know ingress it was obviously
TheSilphRoad,removed,fucking brilliant
TheSilphRoad,removed,i noticed that this morning something like gets you enough lucky eggs to get you most of your xp at the doubled rate if youre careful to always double or triple up your egg incubations in parallel and pop a lucky egg just as theyre about to hatch you could spend a saturday walking a lureheavy downtown area and probably go from
TheSilphRoad,removed,you may want to add to your survey form a question of how many boosts they have executed on the preevolved pokemon if the majority of people dont boost that would make sense if we get some data on of boosts and the evolved weight we may see a pattern
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes what a shame if americans who would otherwise never go near were exposed to a holocaust memorial whats even more terrifying is that some of them might even stop to reflect on it how it happened and how to prevent it from reoccurring we cant have that happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,this kid looks naked its disturbing lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,that isnt a viable moveset nor viable iv
TheSilphRoad,removed,retarded advice evolving an dragonair is pathetic
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh gee i wonder babies are being introduced and a baby position is being introduced whatever could it mean fucktard
TheSilphRoad,removed,we dont know
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope they dont take them away i often play with my phone in my pussy and i like the vibrations
TheSilphRoad,removed,when powering up an electrode your account gets deleted for being a fuckdicktard
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is a reroll feature its called evolving another one
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just buy all the coins i want with my small loan of a million dollars
TheSilphRoad,removed,the point of which is what exactly
TheSilphRoad,removed,i actually got in here to post this exact question i hate me all eggs at once and dont start incubation on any until i have nine and the past week i have gotten at least two but up to five every time i restock its insane
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop hating on cityplayees yall
TheSilphRoad,removed,waste of time for the minority team at least half of our team hasnt come back from the speed stop original prestige nerf
TheSilphRoad,removed,tbh i was expecting smth like now i need to reset times
TheSilphRoad,removed,electric vs ice or ice vs electric neither way
TheSilphRoad,removed,what would be logical is to take the entire sightings and nearby system and dump it in the trash and start over it just doesnt work at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,im confused how many days later people are still posting about this this is like the third post ive seen today
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a collector i cant do that fomo is too strong even if some perfect raticate gets quick attack and dig i need to keep it perfect ivs not from eggs are so rare after all
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is stupid gibraltar is part of europe
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh wow you posted this first thats so amazing thanks for crapping on this guy who had the same thought as you
TheSilphRoad,removed,and some people cant even collect that many pal i am not one of them and could easily buy storage but im thinking of the players that have limited access to many aspects of the game the original games allowed extra storage in each gen why would they not add it in here we have seen by their events they are not opposed to giving the players rewards double exp candy etc why not a heres gen and a little bot of space so you can go catch as many as you want also i think you underestimate the amount of people that keep a living dex pretty much all casual players do not as a goal or anything its just the way it is i have always kept a living dex and didnt even know what that meant until xy my so who is new to pokemon keeps at least of everything she doesnt know what a living dex is its a collection thing and is way more common than you think not everyone plays for the competitive side of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah yes the annual peppermint schnapps leprechaun vomit method
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpspkgetcom this is one of our local tracker it shows iv moves time until despawn and button to open google navigation good luck
TheSilphRoad,removed,be sure to drink your ovaltine
TheSilphRoad,removed,knowing niantic its bound to be something disappointing like increased pidgey spawns
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously times a day at least exact same post always rng
TheSilphRoad,removed,its time for everyones favorite game show confirmation bias applause confetti falls
TheSilphRoad,removed,i had a something but its cp changed when it got nerfed or buffed so i deleted it now i caught a lucky pony who doesnt want a lucky pony is definitely what all the cool trainers have
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah
TheSilphRoad,removed,first day and last day were complete disappointment
TheSilphRoad,removed,then go make your own pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love beating out low level scrubs even more than proper players they have no business using our gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate niantic they do not care about rual and they advertise as if you have to go out in the country to get the good pokemon when really you catch them in your office bathroom
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep weve gone from tracking to sightings to nearby this is a total kick in the nuts to suburban and rural players
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are very dumb far more people have attained ditto since its release than those who attained dragonitesnorlaxlapras in the same amount of time after the release we both know ditto is far more of a frequent spawn than all of the pokemon you listed your stupidity is showing
TheSilphRoad,removed,exceptions dont make the rule most people went through far more than balls before they attained any of the rares the person above listed if you actually believe that ditto is equally or less common of a spawn than dragonitesnorlaxlapras you are living on an entirely different planet
TheSilphRoad,removed,sigh its like pokeporn reading all this stuff about hey i never thought it would happen to me but then this hot little ditto just appeared seems like everyone is getting some but me
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic needs to send their devs on a field trip to rural or suburban regions to play their game for a week they need to see what its like outside a major metropolis in places where pokéstops arent common as pidgies
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah im somewhat boggled that this got past the brainstorming stage
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a space of positivity and friendship
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongo is great for all the circle jerkers in this thread praising niantic for releasing ditto is like praising the grocery store clerk for selling you food
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont care what pidgeys are spawning a mile away i cant see whats spawning next door anymore so the game has become solely a open up as a passenger in the car sort of thing for me now and i find this especially ironic because theyve been actively trying to discourage players from playing and driving this update jsut gave players massive incentive to start doing that again
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup within seconds of the new system being dropped on me i said wellthis really sucks is it the sort of suck that theyre going to fix like they have with balancing or is it the sort that is going to stay and keep getting worse like gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,enough with the lets take a moment i just wanted to say thanks post
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyone downvoting you and the other dude are trash and probably voted clinton
TheSilphRoad,removed,uspez is actually deleting all them
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is strange i think this is the most underwhelming release ever i even suspect them of testing this earlier hence all the reports from people that caught pokemon x but it turned out it was pokemon b all the events so far looked like they wont put some real effort in it to make it amazing
TheSilphRoad,removed,ugh im more bummed about that the nearby menu is now completely useless when poke stops are too far for the sightings menu the pokémon usually spawns for me just before appearing in the nearby menu if it only tells you things you can see whats the point if anything this is the real killer to rural players because they most likely arent in range of a stop to have a sightings menu anyways they completely nuked the already nearly unusable nearby menu well done s
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a interesting fact in the last days i found some pokemon that disappeared from the sightings list for or so and im in a place without the new nearby list seems like sightings updated even for those without the nearby which is stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes lets not pretend they couldve shipped the game just with all regular pokemons right from the start on as its supposed to be we waited over months for a single last implementation
TheSilphRoad,removed,confirmed to be crap tracker our expectations were right pogo is really going down hill just give us our damn old tracker back
TheSilphRoad,removed,what scanners work i have pokestops within miles of my house
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont be retarded
TheSilphRoad,removed,my anecdotal feeling is that they upped the catch rate the first day so everybody got it and were happy and decreased it so we need the time to grind candies to level it up i got the first day then nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,flygps or any other joystick apps solves ypur problem
TheSilphRoad,removed,eggs here were still no chansey onix hitmonlee hitmonchan pinsir scyther magmar jynx electabuzz omanyte kabuto aerodactyl lapras snorlax eevee
TheSilphRoad,removed,not only that but its next to pokéstops and exact location isnt fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,so thats so far three people for it sucks and zero for its great
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree with both of you i said the same kind of thing a minute ago here its nice to see that im not the only one with those feelings
TheSilphRoad,removed,why are people down voting thisomg
TheSilphRoad,removed,there will be a lot of women that wont be allowed to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats why that atlas is trash its no better than using pokeradar
TheSilphRoad,removed,so youre a narc you went on this fb page looking to try and ban people letting people log in an account for regionals get over yourself loser
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyone who played ingress in brazilian cities couldnt complete any tasks before being robbed or shot
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic will have the cool spawns on israel and the shitmons on palestine lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,when will we get it in independent palestine
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait youre high can i grab a bowl from ya i just dinged and im stone freaking sober tt
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic doesnt have to do anything to keep people addicted to the game playing i dont know ask heroin dealers how they manage to get clients to keep coming back
TheSilphRoad,removed,if its not made by niantic then it was a myth
TheSilphRoad,removed,low quality post reported to udronpes
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh cool they finally get the game when its already slowly dying good job niantic d
TheSilphRoad,removed,so i live in finland and at least time a month we visit my mother in law up north in the middle of nowhere up until today it has been pretty randomised note im sitting on my ass at home not moving its too fucking cold to be out cycling therefore only pokes per insense also the house is right next to a lake nearest stop is probably km away and nothing has ever appeared on the radar here this was my first insense of but will test furtherbut what are the chances of out of six being tentacools
TheSilphRoad,removed,an arcanine with bite already makes exeggcutor his bitch
TheSilphRoad,removed,micromanaging your bag to get that xp every time will be a hit to your battery as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,totally agree with this i didnt think there were people who actually wanted this but i get it i guess
TheSilphRoad,removed,not a good change at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,glad they waited until its impossible to get enough items to fill your bag to fix this
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dislike this change
TheSilphRoad,removed,because micromanaging my inventory is tons of fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,as far as dumb things go apart from the three phone screens that have been shattered in our household i did one pretty dumb thing one night fortunately it didnt bite me on the ass i bowl periodically in a league with some guys at work the area where the bowling alley is is one of the rare mystic strongholds in my area so when i go there i am always on the lookout for gyms i can add to so i see this one gym way off in the distance i start driving down this side road towards it suddenly the road ends and there is this rope over a path that leads into this woods of some local park the gym looks like its really close so i hop out of the car and go down this path navigating towards the gym using the flashlight on my phone to see where im going i see a couple forks in the path and i start to get nervous wondering if i can ever remember the way back to my car i found the gym trained it up to level and left triumphantly i did manage to find my way back to the car but the thought occurred to me that if the flashlight on my phone would have given out i would have been in the pitch black no moon that night at all in the middle of a wooded area with paths leading every which way at midnight all by myself i got lucky but it probably wasnt the best decision i ever made i even already had gyms so this was an insurance gym smh
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is actually terrible so your bag is full of ultra balls max revives max potions and berries to get the xp you have to throw away good items and exchange them for most likely bad ones seriously wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah same i only keep the top tier items
TheSilphRoad,removed,no this is a change that makes you waste items in order to get xp what the hell is good about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,once again its a kick in the teeth for top tier players and pandering to casuals
TheSilphRoad,removed,ewwww
TheSilphRoad,removed,its people like this that force the need to post banners of human civility on every pagethread
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the kind of change that just seems to show the incompetence on niantics part since they couldnt project how trainers will play the game before it was released absolutely ridiculous to institute this kind of change almost months after release pffft
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok ill admit it i dont even have this app i cant even afford a phone
TheSilphRoad,removed,first world problems
TheSilphRoad,removed,rtitlegore
TheSilphRoad,removed,rapidashme sorry to hear youre so upset i will canvas the team to find the breakdown and make sure it gets rectified soon we could use another strong contributor for the team please message me if youre interested perhaps your efforts would be better served providing benefits to the community
TheSilphRoad,removed,its xp each regrettably im still some distance from level only i know im so bad at this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,another update for the sake of updating he game every two weeks
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this is sad
TheSilphRoad,removed,having the same problem what is the point of sightings that are already spawned sigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats it
TheSilphRoad,removed,they forgot the bit even though an insignificant update it will add extra lag to oldernewer devices
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is poorly titled for what this update is
TheSilphRoad,removed,when this baby hits miles per hour youre going to see some serious shit youre just not going to see any pokémon doc doc its whats a pokémon marty
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we stop being pissy about useful information being posted on this subreddit who cares if they use psa liberally
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant beat em join em they have to deliver a superior product to the tracking third party sites
TheSilphRoad,removed,seen a few reports in the rpokemongo thread saying that this has only rolled out to san francisco users so far is that the case for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,im probably going to get a lot of flak for this but i dont like it i really hope they have something else up their sleeves for tracking because only tracking things near pokestops sounds terrible
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this should definitely help me out at my three local parks that each have one pokestop each right at the entrance of each park at the far end of the entrance road s i hope they dont think this solves everything and they call it quits at this it doesnt help out rural and suburban players who dont even have pokestops at their parks let alone their neighborhoods
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems like a way of getting people to update lol im good more i update more game breaks fastpokemapdotcom eats this new feature no thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,im wondering how this will affect rural and suburban players whose pokestops may be few and far between
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes well i live rural thanks niantic for telling me that the pokemon is not near the only pokestop in a mile radius this really helps me out a lot
TheSilphRoad,removed,somore reason to stop at poke stops and less tracking in the wild
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe those rural people should stop bellyaching so much and just move to a city like the rest of us its not like itd be a downgrade anyway
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry to be that guy but this looks absolutely terrible and only further alienates people who dont liveplay by a bunch of pokestops honestly the tracking at launch was really good and they just need to go back to that simple yet effective
TheSilphRoad,removed,yippee im so glad i still get to wander around like a headless chicken while those of you in the city get the pokemon literally pointed out to you
TheSilphRoad,removed,so pretty much rural players will be screwed again where i live there are pokestops but not that much so how would this work
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems too easy now
TheSilphRoad,removed,rural players are insignificant because rural people are insignificant statistically speaking of course for what it is worth niantic will eventually fix the game for rural players but it will take more than a few weeks for rural players this game really releases in
TheSilphRoad,removed,british columbia here i got the new update as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,you do realise that most people in the world live in rural or suburban locations an not in the city around the world an the usa isnt most of there clients
TheSilphRoad,removed,but still this new tracker seems so unnecessarily complex and vague
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont want to only catch pokemon near pokestops i want to go out into the wild and find them like in the damn games and the trailer
TheSilphRoad,removed,why would they start caring about balancing things for all players now this just makes city players even more advantaged than they already were while making suburbanrural players just not have to turn off their app to see when things despawn
TheSilphRoad,removed,they are racing against time to make the game fun before the novelty wears off the frequent updates is a shell game
TheSilphRoad,removed,im running the nontest user version of the tracker at the moment and trying to figure out how it works when you arent really near a pokestop im trying to confirm the radius of this new tracker and if the order is correct ill post my findings here psa mon drop off the list a full minutes before they actually despawn
TheSilphRoad,removed,wellington new zealand here ive got the update now too
TheSilphRoad,removed,milan italy invited as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,welp looks like its time to download nox s
TheSilphRoad,removed,how little of the userbase they represent ok then they wont care if rurals will start using cheats after all were just a minority noone will care if we will use helpful programs to enjoy this game properly
TheSilphRoad,removed,it seems like everyone assumes that suburban and rural players dont make up a large part of the pokemon go playerbase but i have yet to see any evidence to support this contention
TheSilphRoad,removed,fairly pointless because we hit the pokestops regardless tracking was only really needed for pokémon that spawn away from them
TheSilphRoad,removed,killer stuff is not what i had in mind when i saw this update all the moves lately seem to just work towards town centers of their target audience and that seems to be there only real goal
TheSilphRoad,removed,but that doesnt mean that you have to ruin the game for people from rural areas completely the first tracker version would have worked in rural areas too this one probably doesnt
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean why cant they just use that system on all nearby a range instead of just the ones near pokestops like really
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont like this at all this solves pretty much nothing why tell me the nearest pokestop when im already there or closer
TheSilphRoad,removed,significant update no this is not
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,what do you mean you seem to think that rural is some exceptional thing when its really not youre very wrong also a lot of small places and towns have only pokestops
TheSilphRoad,removed,also to increase foottraffic to pokestops so that they can sell it to buisness maybe pokestop magikarp spawn for x nice marketing
TheSilphRoad,removed,turns out people dont play something you wont let them
TheSilphRoad,removed,what more do you want something that works when you only have or pokestops within a mile radius understand that its frustrating when a system that used to work for everyone no matter where you lived is now being replaced with one that doesnt
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre the kind of person who enjoys playing multiplayer games alone arent you
TheSilphRoad,removed,a freeworld tracking system that isnt based around the wildly uneven distribution of stops would be nice like i dunno the original tracking system
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not a hotcold game if the thermometer only has one temperature
TheSilphRoad,removed,even urban players should be mad about this iirc one of the philosophies of the game was to get out and explore new areas and towns there is no incentive to go to any rural area or many state parks
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks too easy for me and seems to concentrate the spawns even more around pokestops the grass thing alone would be enough imho
TheSilphRoad,removed,knowing exactly where to go is far less fun say that to the thousands of players who used pokevision
TheSilphRoad,removed,u are so reacting as a niantic person ofcourse its not more lucrative to focus on the more densely areas i mean at the first place you think that most people live in urbanbig cities while playing this game i think that can be true for usa but for the rest of the world is a totally diffrent story for examle the netherlands aprox people live outside amsterdam but mil live around amsterdam in small cities in a big area in those small cities are a lot less pokestops they are truely ruing there playerbase with focussing on more dense areas if you look outside usa
TheSilphRoad,removed,can anyone provide an apk of the pokestop tracker or is it linked to your account
TheSilphRoad,removed,good as a rural player all i have is the sightings section its functionally the same as the no steps weve been dealing with glad rural players continue to get shafted s
TheSilphRoad,removed,that looks absurdly easy seems to massively discourage pursuing pokemon away from stops ie exploring in favour of just farming stops
TheSilphRoad,removed,as of of the population lived in cities so to suggest rural and suburban players are such a tiny minority is absurd
TheSilphRoad,removed,this looks really awful especially for rural players is this really the best they could do
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn ive said this like times since the sub started and got or each time seems finally people are getting it
TheSilphRoad,removed,the system is just broken i live in the suburbs of the main capital our neighborhood has inhabitants only pokestop i went on vacation to a village in the middle of nowhere inhabitants pokestops in a radius youre telling me they care about those rural old ladies
TheSilphRoad,removed,guys i have a girlfriend xdxd
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant login after the new update it says that servers are down bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,great now you really have to be in a city to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know whats depressingly funny is that this tracking is really for city folks but city folks are the ones who mostly didnt really mind the broken tracking because pokemon are so densely populated in cities it was the suburban rural folks who really felt the lack of tracking and complained about it but this new system does nothing for them i know it updates faster but the order of the sightings list is still out of whack if they at least changed the ordering of the sightings list to sort by distance theyd help everyone here
TheSilphRoad,removed,every update post i see is littered with complaints from rural players im in the middle personally i get that everyone wants to play and that it sucks for rural players but have rural players considered that maybe just maybe they are not the demographic this game is aimed at this new nearby function just seems to add to that assumption
TheSilphRoad,removed,they represent of the population in the us which is hardly trivial
TheSilphRoad,removed,what about people living far from pokestops cant track pokemons anymore lol what a crappy system is that
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont spoof though dont use party maps though the rich get richer
TheSilphRoad,removed,its cute you think apple hasnt been sued for texting
TheSilphRoad,removed,no the jiantic ceo siad that wasnt fun and he knows what fun is for everyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is an extremely frustrating update for me c my two closest pokestops are a half hour walk from me in opposite directions i live in a populated suburb of people so its not like im in the middle of nowhere but if this is how tracking ends up in its final form i dont think i can bring myself to play anymore which really bumms me out but it will be clear at that point its a city only game
TheSilphRoad,removed,can confirm am rural stopped playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,living in a suburb this also annoys me there is a pokestop within walking distance but only one
TheSilphRoad,removed,then the nearby feature is useless the only pokemon ive seen spawn near any local stop was from lures not spawns you can tell based on the color of the ring at the base of the poke
TheSilphRoad,removed,reallyreally i would wager that rural players aka people that dont have stops on every corner make up the majority of the player base
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey guys i found a niantic employee
TheSilphRoad,removed,youll hear of people getting hanged next
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate to be the guy who says this but this post is probably more appropriate for rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,卍
TheSilphRoad,removed,also wtf is with a bulbasaur breaking out of an ultraball with a razberry theyre made in pokechina
TheSilphRoad,removed,this totally stinks for everybody it just pins the nearest pokestop that doesnt help you find squat what if it is away from that nearest stop just lame
TheSilphRoad,removed,who cares about a ban wave if the bot developers are being taken down hit the problem at its source
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry to bother you guys but am i misunderstanding something or are the tuesday codes supposed to have been posted about five minutes ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,august edtno new codes after refreshing tons
TheSilphRoad,removed,anyone get the code for today est
TheSilphRoad,removed,edtish
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is currently edt no new codes yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,tfw and no codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,its edt is it not im confused
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been refreshing this page since and nothing im at work and my teammates are waiting for me to have lunch
TheSilphRoad,removed,feels sad
TheSilphRoad,removed,for codes spam refreshing purpose httpswwwredditcomuserdronpes httpstwittercomthesilphroad httpstwittercomsearchftweetsverticaldefaultqthesilphroadsrctypd
TheSilphRoad,removed,todays code
TheSilphRoad,removed,tuesday code
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep im botting tons of accounts at the moment using different bots because if they start to ban at least theres a chance some of the accounts get through ive been botting in batches of accounts since weeks ago once the account reaches i stop and start another batch every days or so no bans at the moment
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been using a sniper progam to catch them i have like five dragonites in an hour
TheSilphRoad,removed,they might catch a fewbut ive been botting experimentally with different settings on different accounts for weeks im a lot of my accounts will never be flagged because i stopped botting on them a while ago
TheSilphRoad,removed,banning websites and hunting down developers isnt progress its just spiteful you need to ban the botters and spoofers the accounts ban them all
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic babying san fran players even more
TheSilphRoad,removed,shutting down boy sites will do almost nothing hackers will find a way they will have to shut the boys down with bans not by strong arm them into shutting down their sites why you the thepiratebay stayed up so long and when it goes down there are more just like it
TheSilphRoad,removed,why put grass around the pokemon if you can only catch most of them in the city wake up niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre literally just running into random pokemon that your app tells you to find at that point there is no hunt whatsoever with your subscribed method just oh hey look theres a clefairy in this exact location go uh walk to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,getting there is not difficult a minute time for meters is laughably forgiving catch the pokémon is not difficult almost everyone has a catch rate
TheSilphRoad,removed,you still have to get within that range you dont know its there yet hence my statement oh hey look theres a clefairy you still have the challenge of actually catching it how many levels of difficulty do you need before youre satisfied oh you mean the overlysimplistic method of swiping your finger on your phone and praying to rngsus come on man should we have to play a matching game at every pokestop run an obstacle course every time we spend candy to power up yes clearly this is exactly what im suggesting we do glad you caught on i think that the system of get into the general area and catch the pokemon is already a sufficient challenge next to nobody agrees with you friend thrill of the hunt is a real thing thrill of the swipe your finger and pray is not
TheSilphRoad,removed,im pretty sure hes got it on his clipboard at all times
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres a dirty joke in there somewhereim too lazy to think of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,name of tool blossoms pogo manager link of tool httpsgithubcomblossomforthblossomspokemongomanagerreleases whats the tool java applet that runs locally anywhere java will run in theory and returns the ivs level cp moveset etc of all your pokémon and displays it in a simple searchable table format output can also be copypasted in excelsheets etc the app also allows you to bulk transfer evolve and power up pokémon why you like itadvantages it uses google authorisation codes rather than having you login with your full account details and only stores it locally if you want it to so its pretty secure yet it has a lot of features and makes comparinganalysing your captures much faster and easier
TheSilphRoad,removed,these games can become a means for directing guided missiles and even cause disruptions to ambulances and fire trucks are you fucking kidding me lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,name of tool gostats link of tool httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomdshtgostatshlen whats the tool gostats lets you see your virtual creatures ivs features attack ivs defense ivs stamina ivs moves weaknesses types multipliers catch rate flee rate max cp cap battles won battles lost evolutions and also player stats
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate that sub too the mods are nazis and of the populace just complains and complains and complains andcomplains probably the worst gaming community i have seen since forums were invented
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is not better than a working paws this is absolutely better than only paws but that was terrible anyway
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh look another great feature that shits on rural and suburban players fantastic
TheSilphRoad,removed,not really
TheSilphRoad,removed,i play while driving quite a bit so basicly the update aimed to stop you from playing while driving but instead it got you even more reasons to do so
TheSilphRoad,removed,poke at half health and an army of disposable pidgeotto and raticate
TheSilphRoad,removed,what you have is geographical spawn growlithe are very common so long as you have the right geography
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just searched stardust calculator httpsbuimichaelgithubiopokemongostardustcalculator
TheSilphRoad,removed,boring and uninformative post congratulations but posts like these are frequent better for social media with your friends
TheSilphRoad,removed,for android is an app called gym tracker logo is a snorlax its in the playstore i created a topic with link about it to discuss it and dont know if it is against tos andor if i shall use it myself
TheSilphRoad,removed,for android there is an app called gym tracker logo is a snorlax its in the playstore i created a topic with link about it to discuss it and dont know if it is against tos andor if i shall use it myself
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is how they came up with the cp formula after the last rebalance alright so lets figure out a way to make alakazam the best attacker in the game what about the other pokemon i cant be bothered
TheSilphRoad,removed,a lot of gymhuntr talk here keep in mind gymhuntr is a scanning tool be careful because these ninatic tos breaking scans happen on your device so potentially the ip most associated with your pogo account is also showing bot activity and that can potentially get you banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i thought for awhile it was somehow not using the api like the pokemon scanners somehow due to the lag but going off it being down for the bot banwave it probably actually just uses barely any accounts for scanning so if a bunch of people are trying at once it can take forever its not very useful for contested gyms because of that but its good for ones that dont get battled too often i wish niantic would release some official version because the alternative is driving with your phone out as a gps to look for gyms which is obviously dangerous and a thing i dont want to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokétracker on ios is barely working captchas are almost constantly required
TheSilphRoad,removed,really every single thing in the app could use an overhaul
TheSilphRoad,removed,the site breaks tos and doesnt need any promotion here people are against spoofers but when a site like that uses spoofing to gather data they think it is ok all scanners are cheating
TheSilphRoad,removed,shut up faggot
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is nowhere near accurate where i am every single gym i checked was way off i can see from my house even and none of those are close to being right right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,only if im using the bus otherwise i wouldnt go out just for pokémon go anymore the game is currently frustrating and boring
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre missing one option in your poll because i can
TheSilphRoad,removed,i never spoofed i dont spoof but i might start spoofing because of the state of the game right now i waste time freeze my hands off i travel in my rural area for long time only to find bugs rattattas and few pokestops with eggs not getting even half the distance i walk i just want to have a fair chance against others or fair chance at completing pokedex spoofing would give me that
TheSilphRoad,removed,he just wants to brag about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,he just wants to brag about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i donampersandpoundsignthirtyninesemicolon spoof too much risk of getting caught not like the old days
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont spoof lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,this shit pisses me off daily
TheSilphRoad,removed,you forgot the i want to but im too lazy option i dont have access to a lot of pokestops or gyms theres nothing in the way of interesting pokemon i dont really have a lot of options even when im traveling i dont find anything new anymore theres not a lot of reason for me to play right now im missing about pokemon from my dex with not even a hint of finding them and no real gyms with convenient access its super tempting to root my phone to spoof a bit to fix some of that because it appears to be the only way for me to progress short of flying to the west coast or overseas
TheSilphRoad,removed,i did this for a long long time used to only be able to hit one stop a day so spoofed to an area in my town that had reachable stops i wish i could say i tried to avoid catching anything but a muk came up so i grabbed that given that the only time i have items is once the day streak comes in i have an empty bag days a week because i dont know how to spoof any more open to pms explaining how its done downvote me all you want
TheSilphRoad,removed,i always have two
TheSilphRoad,removed,survey needs to add weather as a reason some of us live in the desert in non pedestrian city where you can only drive being outside walking is a death sentence
TheSilphRoad,removed,i do not spoof but how does one spoof on ios
TheSilphRoad,removed,wheres the to play normally because its and i dont own a car option
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really believe without party trackers this game would have just about petered out and died already most anybody remotely rural would have lost all patience with pure pidgeyrat ubiquity and moved on
TheSilphRoad,removed,what absolute total incompetent bs niantic youre fired
TheSilphRoad,removed,hows the site called
TheSilphRoad,removed,hypocrysis always been strong in the human genre
TheSilphRoad,removed,which appwebsite did you scan this with
TheSilphRoad,removed,and the only will evolve into a rocksmashmegahorn rhydon
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you are really going to be upset that a little kid can enjoy the game without having to be in a crowded public area you have issues i would rather my child be safe at home im sure you would aswell
TheSilphRoad,removed,what map do you use
TheSilphRoad,removed,to be honest i get rid of the shit ill never ever use fearow dugtrio doduo most sandshrew most marowak theres a lot of pokemon that are useless because there is something better why have any rapidash when arcanine is a lot more effecient
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the best post of the day downvotes
TheSilphRoad,removed,downvotes from cheaters hardly your post is just brash and aggressive those who dont think of gps drift as cheating and berate spoofers are hardly hypocrites they simply have different views of what defines cheating but hey youre allowed to be an ass about your opinion
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is the biggest distance youve walked w your buddy this one deserve a jogger medal
TheSilphRoad,removed,what app are you using for the scans
TheSilphRoad,removed,a few tips learn to throw just as their attack animation is ending even back to back attacks will have a small window in between them if the ball hits the instant the circle returns youre doing it right master this and youll never have balls wasted by jumping or attacking again dont catch trash thats high level run from orange pidgeys paras venonats etc they break out too much for their usefulness find a place that has a good number of stops you can hit in a short time httpswwwpokemongomapinfo is great for this plan a loop and walk it or if you have someone to play with and its feasible to drive slowly drive the loop for mad pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey what app might you be using for the scans
TheSilphRoad,removed,tangela
TheSilphRoad,removed,i work from home days per week and dont always get a spin every day i do get a daily catch
TheSilphRoad,removed,while these threads are annoying its directly niantics fault for not communicating with the community
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes public transportation sucks now for pogo and its sad because it asks if im a passenger and i really freaking am a passenger
TheSilphRoad,removed,anyone get the name of the scanning app
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think
TheSilphRoad,removed,they do spawn at specific times though
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic are stone cold pros always ready for any and all eventualities good at communicating to their customer base too game design rockstars if you ask me
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats their own damn fault for grossly underestimating how popular a free to play pokemon game would be
TheSilphRoad,removed,no stop giving them benefit of the doubt its insane that they didnt see this coming and the have been printing money hand over fist they have no excuses at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats such an autistic thing to say leave your wife because she doesnt play a mobile game what the fuck is wrong with you
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemongodev is against spoofing you are wrong also spoofers dont have maps they are so stupid in cases i can trust this
TheSilphRoad,removed,then why are you playing all the people i know arent playing anymore the game is literally unplayable without a car in our area
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow youre the first
TheSilphRoad,removed,been at least for me havent been able to log in since just before and now the day is almost over i was only on my third day iirc but the daily bonuses are my main source of dust so im really not happy about this i hope we get something as an apology even if i doubt we will
TheSilphRoad,removed,get all your spoofing apps ready everyone were all travelling to the states
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can chil out this whole thread is laughable
TheSilphRoad,removed,my uncle who works at nintendo says youre making it up
TheSilphRoad,removed,my uncle who works at nintendo says youre making it up
TheSilphRoad,removed,who the hell upvotes stuff like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,well good thing op is from uk not south africa so any proof he could provide that would risk his friends moms job for your own sense of validation wouldnt even be relevant to you so stop being a pessimistic jerk about it and just wait the two days and find out for yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,the proof is all over for those who want it but whatever waste time sitting here posting nonsense in the adults pogo sub its fine theyll come clean it all up soon enough
TheSilphRoad,removed,no a little older than nes dont get snarky
TheSilphRoad,removed,ffs first they gave us trump and now this
TheSilphRoad,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
TheSilphRoad,removed,nests are really the only positive anything not near a stop youre screwed
TheSilphRoad,removed,in no way whatsoever is it cool to have a klan app racism shouldnt belong in pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,no i do not want filters either i want the choice to have old system back for seconds this morning i had a full old nearbys including a jinx then it reverted back to this piece of chit new sightings that told me i could go mile away to catch a pidgey a weedle and a venomat this size fits all bigotry against suburban players is pure hatred by niantic love niantics hate
TheSilphRoad,removed,michael
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the time i see this very idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats definitely interesting not experiencing it on this end would you mind taking a screenshot and uploading it to imgur
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow you could be getting extra xp or in my case closer to the next level up whopeedo
TheSilphRoad,removed,what if my johnson was the size of a horses have you thought of that
TheSilphRoad,removed,anyone who plays this game on sprint knows that we deserve some sort of bonus for the terrible unlimited data speeds we have to endure in my city one of the only solid places to playgymsstops catches good walking space is a black hole so im praying we get like a special sprint ball to use in dead zones that catches like haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,new items dropping only at these pokestops
TheSilphRoad,removed,fullsail cringing intensifies
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre killing me op i simply cannot process all this humor
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are way to dramatic about this its a old who obviously doesnt care for ivs stop projecting your fanatism on your kids normally parents do that with grades in school you know at least stuff that matters let your kids have fun with their high cp mons and dont force them to play a game your way because thats the right way to play because kids at that age dont really give a f about number crunching and small percentages of battle performance in a game about tapping your screen fast to defeat an army of vaporeons
TheSilphRoad,removed,oooh interesting seems like tomorrow is a big day for pokemon go if your definition of big day is a bunch of new sponsored pokestops in stores
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep looks like trump wasnt lying
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope
TheSilphRoad,removed,the typical dutch style over cocky over arrogant response im used to dutch people and their very self obsessed ways
TheSilphRoad,removed,xposts between here and rpokemongo are seldom a good idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongo is a storm of trolls and children no one there is reasonable enough to have a mature conversation about concerns for the game my apologies if i wanted to have a mature conversation with some like minded fans of the game about concerns it isnt healthy to bottle up your feelings and not speak to someone about them surprisingly this is actually making me more nervous than it should and it wouldnt be healthy for me to sit here and not discuss it if a mod wants me to delete the post i will happily do it but last time i checked you are not a mod therefore you have no power to tell me this doesnt belong
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel like ive wandered into rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,fpm claims it should be back this weekend probably little consolation for you though
TheSilphRoad,removed,hopefully they fix the contrast issues ugh
TheSilphRoad,removed,let me rephrase for you guys a small number of users who still play this game are still having problems with the game this is an announcement to notify these users that we know about these problems but it is unlikely that they will be fixed have fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know with all the tracker accounts softbanned and this supposedly massive burden on their servers being gone id expect the game to run smoother now
TheSilphRoad,removed,correct notably the nonbonus throws which presumably were roughly an average ring size performed worse than even a nice throw so if youre going to just ignore ring size going for a nice bonus will do you better than the average we observed in the throw dataset
TheSilphRoad,removed,banter was here shik is a loser
TheSilphRoad,removed,heh i signed on earlier after new update finally took to have to change my screen name i guess niantic didnt take kindly to now another variant with in the name
TheSilphRoad,removed,that was intended as a compliment whats your damage
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would but i cannot and the people would still use the scan maps instead when possible
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont use this as much as i had when it first rolled out the main reason is the lack of knowledge of what the difference is between nests multi spawn points and just plain random spawns once i started visiting nests reported near enough for me to travel to only to find how inaccurate they were i got turned off it would also have been nice if the old migration reported could be expired to clean up the map
TheSilphRoad,removed,or they understand the cant continue to lose that many players every week
TheSilphRoad,removed,they do all this to try to stop what they perceive as cheaters yet leave all of those toxic spam comments and links in their twitter feed
TheSilphRoad,removed,it appears its true for ios somebody said its due to the additional hoops niantic added to prevent scanners from working
TheSilphRoad,removed,most likely niantic hq 😉
TheSilphRoad,removed,duh
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic shoot itself i nthe foot because they didnt expect this succes they thought they could slowly improve the game like ingress and that it would slowly add players if they knew this succes they would wait and introduce pvp to keep people busy the big problem now is thathere are two very simple mechanics catch pokémon minigame hat my year old can do no curveball and fighting gyms spamming attacks that my year old can do no dodging its not intresting and the endgoal to catch them all doesnt work without a tracker the game was fun because the first levels were easy and everyone is doing it the game will get a bit of hype if we can pvp each other have events and trading but we will never see the hype again
TheSilphRoad,removed,not all of them are equal is a lot stronger than
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic hates us no cool pokes for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,more organized than the actual qa team of this game ftfy
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah lets stop whining and circle jerk everything instead
TheSilphRoad,removed,because figuring out how existing things work and trying to add features a tracker are similar things
TheSilphRoad,removed,because figuring out how existing things work and trying to add features a tracker are similar things it all loops back around to niantic not doing their job either way
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was wondering lately if we could sue niantic for ruining all our batteries p on the serious part i used to charge my phone once every or days its already one year old now with all those charges daily in less than months xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,it crashes more now
TheSilphRoad,removed,still waiting for update that fixes it so we dont have to pick pokemon for training at a level gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sure you like games not everyone does
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracker no in the trash it goes
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry but this sub whines a lot it doesnt whine particularly less than any other sub ive been on have to click one extra button to get to a menu wahhhhhhhhhhhhhh someone steal a gym from you the second it opens wahhhhhhhhhhhhhh not to mention any glitches in the game crashing a lot get your act together niantic god you people dont care about your community and not just whining but whining about really frivolous things
TheSilphRoad,removed,opened the app store got the download instantly thanks nianitic now get back in your work pens and fix our games problems
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope whats happening is niantic keeps throwing new processes in trying to hide their api data that essentially do nothing but bloat the app and drain more power in the process
TheSilphRoad,removed,this has to do with their answer to fight against gym stagnation and make gym mechanics more dynamic its funny that their answer is just to add more gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,it uses the cp of your highest pokémon if all of your team is lower than the ones you beat then you get a lot of prestige it depends on the gym most of them i still only kill bottom defender
TheSilphRoad,removed,do sperm whales eat a lot of seamen
TheSilphRoad,removed,probably because it still doesnt meet niantics standards of quality
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not the new features thats draining the battery its that the of the calculations are useless its just there to harden breaking the api
TheSilphRoad,removed,its because all the code obfuscation they are implementing to try to keep people from reverse engineering the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,mostly because they are spending much more time trying to stop map scanners and bots than working on advancing the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,im guessing niantic forgot that they hadnt released it to everyone else yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,but wheres the money for niantic in that
TheSilphRoad,removed,so i just got this notification on android i always hated when games do this
TheSilphRoad,removed,very annoying
TheSilphRoad,removed,they added them in the second update i believe but this is the first time theyve actually been used i was hoping they would use them like they do in ingress to notify you about a nearby portal gym psa you can block them on android and ios in your notification settings
TheSilphRoad,removed,argh why did they think that was a good idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,makes me wonder if niantic developers play the actual game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just got one for the first time today after updating to stating the new catch bonus and gym training thought it was for a different app because i didnt think they would use it like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope they are not going use the fbtwitter post as notification for example its friday trainers have you registered a new pokémon to your pokédex this past week firstcatchfriday
TheSilphRoad,removed,id love a setting like this to notify me when a specific mon is nearby though
TheSilphRoad,removed,can you like have bots that automatically map where the pokemon are
TheSilphRoad,removed,i run a scanner in ann arbor mi and our spawnpoint locations and times were entirely unchanged during the last migration
TheSilphRoad,removed,except ops mom
TheSilphRoad,removed,to be a part of the atlas group was the reason i originally joined the road it was so complicated and asked for personal information about where i live to a degree i wasnt comfortable with then my phone started behaving in a fasion i would consider questionable i wasnt sure what to make of the whole experience havent been back since the tool is dead to me
TheSilphRoad,removed,catching pokémon is a means and not an end its how you become high level but its not what you do at high level
TheSilphRoad,removed,list use the atlas did you even bother to check the sticky
TheSilphRoad,removed,jus reading his post alone is a massive effort
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one ever reads reports there are cheates in all our gyms reported many times nothing happens
TheSilphRoad,removed,the niantic stock will sure as hell skyrocket
TheSilphRoad,removed,surprised i didnt see anything already youre surprised i think thats all this sub talked about yesterday
TheSilphRoad,removed,new info
TheSilphRoad,removed,smh
TheSilphRoad,removed,faxbruh
TheSilphRoad,removed,not sure what youre getting at im aware pokémon can have iv isnt that what we always hope for
TheSilphRoad,removed,til i have a iv lapras with a gym defender ranking come at me mystic teamvalor
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry you put that part after a period nobody reads more than the first sentence of a comment dont you know
TheSilphRoad,removed,why wood different iv change recommonded move set this is wrong and fucken stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,no you dont dipshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you talking about the thats refeeeimg to ivs scroll down and it explains it percentages refers to the best possible defender lapras for exemple vaporeon with watergun hydro pump means that it has of the maximum defense potential
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol why are you so abrasive all of your comments toward other people have unprompted anger how old are you maybe if you actually took the time to understand the context instead of just making an assumption you might actually learn something
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is my location man this explains why kids are constantly walking by the house
TheSilphRoad,removed,isnt this just random though when i first started playing i walked into a qdoba in fucking osh kosh wisconsin not a huge town and or different pokemon popped out of the ground like this i also had this happen when i walked into my hotel in atlanta last week but it didnt happen again after that
TheSilphRoad,removed,are there lots of mooses in the fields and lots of small bass fishes in the pond nearby that would go nicely with all the pokemons also i believe the grammar police will be knocking on your door soon rant over
TheSilphRoad,removed,ikr wat a noob
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been dealing with this bug pretty consistently myself and its incredibly annoying whats worse though wasting a couple of balls because of a bug or playing a poorly coded game that punishes you for leveling last night aside from herculean throws i had incense lured pokemon run after the first ball pwrs that break out and run instantly im level and capture rate has decreased for me personally to the point where i really dont even want to play consistently anymore it doesnt really matter how you slice it the game seems pretty intent on forcing you to waste balls play more or buy more and repeat ad infinitum
TheSilphRoad,removed,so youre saying that essentially we should change our normally functional mechanics because of a game bug that is clearly not supposed to be working that way
TheSilphRoad,removed,i run bot accounts and of the accounts that held gyms for more than hours were banned not sure if reports only cause a check or can conclusively lead to a ban but so far the one that didnt hold gyms were fine
TheSilphRoad,removed,isnt that kinda what pokefind is
TheSilphRoad,removed,how the hell did you get all those
TheSilphRoad,removed,feels like this was the only useful thing this entire update lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,smh these guys are really lazy coders the proper way to do it would be to have the buttons at the correct place visually as per design then animate them down only when they need to display a banner at the top this way just leaves an unsightly gap of the time its stuff like this the black status bar at night the uses remaining on the egg screen so little attention to detail its not funny
TheSilphRoad,removed,and niantic is still pretending the bug never existed not a word about it in the patch notes kudos to you guys for fixing their fuckup though they should hire you they couldnt find that or many other bugs for months
TheSilphRoad,removed,oo dont you think you could have used the money better there are so many charities and local clubs which always need money why do you need to play pogo where is the need
TheSilphRoad,removed,that would be nice it would also fix the annoying is due of not getting eggs if your item bag is full also they can have special items that randomly spawn for minutes once or twice a day these could include otherwise difficult to get things like lures incense incubators candy gold coins and ultra rare special items incubators incubates as fast great lures lures harder to find pokemon for min great incense see above lucky eggs speed modulator sets the speed cap to for min limit special item per account per store per spawn
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,great idea and its not to much if you balanced it shame thats never gonna happen though
TheSilphRoad,removed,hisher perception is extremely skewed census data shows that austin is in the top percentile for the entire country in laymen terms austins population is larger than over of every city in the usa
TheSilphRoad,removed,worst idea yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,this will reduce revenue for niantic and the ceo wont get a bigger bonus check hence it wont happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,why are people so happy about this in my opinion pointless feature why should i care from which city a pokemon i caught hatched is if it showed the exact location then i would praise this feature but telling me i caught it in some city is pretty pointless
TheSilphRoad,removed,like many others have said this is a useless feature the old map location that they removed was much more helpful
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i kinda agree with our government being a crap hole right now they have the power to do whatever they want with your small business not that they would and even in an ideal free market than your customers would own you because without them your business fails
TheSilphRoad,removed,you make it first and make it elegant later yeah thats the same as saying itll never happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,they act like its a new feature when in reality its a dumbed down version if the original feature that showed a map of where it was caught steps back step forward
TheSilphRoad,removed,like what the f do they even do regression testing for a release or do they have one person on qa for the whole project with no automation so they can never get through testing anything thats embarrassing i work in qa for software testing if i allowed this many things to slip through the cracks i dont think i would have a job anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,true ask me every april when im furious about my taxes however being beholden to fewer is better
TheSilphRoad,removed,the same reason niantic has already had to do move rebalancing eg halving water gun dps because they have a halfassed understanding of how combat actually works and didnt think about it its a mistake to think that they gave weak charged moves on purpose versus it just being a mistake they havent fixed for moves like bulldoze and twister it is harder for them to fix now because it affects other mons that they likely dont want to buff and weve already seen that when they replace available moves they dont remove them from existing mons
TheSilphRoad,removed,introduce text fixes each update dont manage to have actually working text code beautiful irony
TheSilphRoad,removed,i still hope for an interactive tracker which actually indicates if you come closer anything else is bullshit stop feeding urban players even more with pokestop trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not keen on the concept myself i do find it interesting that they have yet to move it to a much wider release so im wondering if maybe niantic itself isnt happy with it and maybe are working on an alternative
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think theyre trying to influence where people play pogo so they can sell pokestops better bu im not sure if that is too conspiratorial
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokewhere ios
TheSilphRoad,removed,dope
TheSilphRoad,removed,this games dead af
TheSilphRoad,removed,yet i cant even get a simple response email from niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,what about the honorable nation of the rooted phone
TheSilphRoad,removed,but nobody with root
TheSilphRoad,removed,goddamn mongorians
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,so instead of fixing bugs and glitches they release in more countries right the quest for more money
TheSilphRoad,removed,harambe thanks you
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have no clue on how to answer your question but im curious as to how people collect that data so precisely would you mind telling me how you got that data because id love to do the same for areas local to myself
TheSilphRoad,removed,true
TheSilphRoad,removed,what good is askingbugging them about it going to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you press the button you acknowledge the responsibility as your own it is essentially just another simple way of niantic to say we are not responsible for your stupidity nothing more if you dont press it you signify your role as a driver so in both cases you are denied of progress you have to travel below the limit to gain benefits of progress again
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive sort of been doing it programmatically in my area and using the human eye to make sense of it definitely possible
TheSilphRoad,removed,he spaceclops
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just used the ingame appraisal system
TheSilphRoad,removed,im collecting ive more than entries yesterday i posted some iv distribution moveset data
TheSilphRoad,removed,i used necrobot got the ones i wanted and then quit its hard to believe people still play this this is the day i unsubscribe
TheSilphRoad,removed,speaking as an ihabitant of oceania i think you need to spend more time in school httpsenwikipediaorgwikithirdworld
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh cool good to know holyshit you have so many bonbons
TheSilphRoad,removed,i came
TheSilphRoad,removed,hydropump is correct in english the player who took the screenshot is german and therefore it says hydropumpe instead of hydropump pump is pumpe in german
TheSilphRoad,removed,germans missing humor
TheSilphRoad,removed,you realize they were selling merch before the game even the field test was live right
TheSilphRoad,removed,love probably is not the right word considering niantic screwed us over to begin with not allowing us to discard old eggs allowing adult pokemon to hatch from eggs announcing the event which got players buying incubators to clear out their eggs for the event only to discount the price afterwards this event is them reacting to their short sighted decisions
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe somewhere rural i live in a suburban area and ive completed the pokedex in two months
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we get an american hero to achieve such great heights someone we dont deserve but a hero we need perhaps a joey chestnutesque figure of pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,tommorow
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont you say
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wish gyms worked like so gym leader dictates the team color of the gym but gym defense is not limited to team instead when you go to a gym you decide if you are attack or defending i think this would go a long way to getting rid of gym stagnation and certain cities being run by group
TheSilphRoad,removed,i want a team of blastoise people be like do you hear that blast noise oh damn its zerthas with his blastoise
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats with all the rattata is this game a route simulator
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that sucks first time holding more than too well shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,file a report niantic will do nothing about it file another report niantic will do nothing about it get a dozen other users to file a report niantic will do nothing about it give up lose hope quit game this seems to be the common cycle happening all over the world right now sorry dude
TheSilphRoad,removed,funny how you became a pokemon nerd when most of the og pokemon nerds have already quit the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,or we could just do it amongst ourselves chanseys in gyms everywhere maybe
TheSilphRoad,removed,welcome to the first few weeks of excitement that everyone felt when the game launched what is left is a road of dissapointment left by niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,spoofer
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would suggest using openstreetmaporg instead its very likely that niantic used their data to determine their nests the city i live in has several nests in parks where the nest spawn points match osm but fall outside park boundaries in google maps pokemongohubnet had an great article on how to find nests with osm someone had a osm query tool that could predict nest areas when i checked it out the nests in my city matched with zones the tool predicted although not all predicted zones had nests using the tool i found a few previously unknown nests when im back at a real computer ill try to find the link and update this post
TheSilphRoad,removed,that sounds about right to me
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is amazing stars golden medals and trophies galore
TheSilphRoad,removed,where are the codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,its est where is the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,way to be a doormat lmao let people walk all over you and potentially others because youre afraid of confrontation
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have the exact same iv im powering mine up and using it to train pidgeottos against to get prestige per sushi battle
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here i get invisible mons once my datacap runs out and i get throttled down to dialup waiting andor restarting the app helps for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,im just using the spinning fan thing so my phone can charge while it self walks
TheSilphRoad,removed,because theyre greedy and would rather not pay for more servers to support all countries while enabling all features
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you think pokeadvisor constitutes as cheating its probably using a modified or uninsured software i really want to use it but im very hesitant
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you simply cant understand that the nearby system implemented isnt large enough then thats on you id happily go to a park if i see or hear a certain pokemon i want is there and available for the next minutes as it stands theres simply no way for me to tell if the thing is there or how long it will be there ive missed pokemon by some minutes due to unknown times they spawn and remain if you cant see the point im making that allowing me to see or find specifically what im after increases my enjoyment and gets me out of the house than youre unwilling to listen man
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been lurking for weeks but i just had to create a username to tell you this uninstall the app then reinstall it i dowloaded the game and was always perplexed by my friends finding more mon than me then i showed them the white circles with nothing in them and they said something my oblivious ass never noticed thats what appears around all the wild pokemon spawns i was dumbfounded but reluctantly enlightened i was so afraid to uninstall my account i was lvl and had put so much work into into it so to be sure i used a friends phone to dl the game he promptly became addicted seperate story and loaded my google profile with no ill effects so i uninstalled it then reinstalled it on my phone worked like a charm so thats what a spearow looks like tldr uninstall then reinstall the app trust me a friend
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats niantic in a nutshell
TheSilphRoad,removed,too many people from rpokemongo coming here
TheSilphRoad,removed,itt people who have been using third party pokemon maps yet get mad at twitch cheaters
TheSilphRoad,removed,france is just one big zoo kappa
TheSilphRoad,removed,people will also do anything to get out of paying several thousands of dollars to travel to another continent to complete a video game honestly in a lot of ways niantic brought this on themselves with the decision to make it impossible to catch them all in one area not condoning the cheaters but when you create a demand for cheating dont be surprised when you get cheaters
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly at this point id believe the answer is everything
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have a nexus mine will occasionally get really slow and laggy while playing pokemon go this seems to mainly occur id my phone has been on for a while and had gotten really hot especially when outside and charging typically if i reboot my phone everything is fine is this happening in other applications as well does it improve if you reboot do you have any other things ruining in the background that could be causing issues before anything else id probably try uninstalling and reinstalling the app
TheSilphRoad,removed,i didnt realize it was confirmed that the pokemon in the egg is determined at the time of getting the egg and not at the point of hatching well i still say record your screen at least to show that it hatched in the states if anyone accuses you of spoofing tell them to fuck off and report you because when niantic finally gets around to checking it in the next years maybe theyll see its nonsense and move on
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can relate just hatched a magmar today but it got karate chop instead of ember fml
TheSilphRoad,removed,and then i quickly made a new account and captured it in the hopes that trading goes live some day have there been any recent updates on this
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokenotify never works for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,it was hours a day for days your argument is that its hard for someone to do that if you have a weekend off work thats entirely doable now for where my point comes in imagine someone just spreading that out the game has been out a month you take one weekend for hours then another for hours repeat the next two weekends what do ya know million experience a month hours a weekend hours a day thats only counting weekends lets say someone stops for an hour each day after work that takes the count even higher what if they use public transportation even higher still the people saying everyones a cheater and that level isnt possible really dont understand math and this guy basically proved it
TheSilphRoad,removed,a whole lot of opinions i disagree with most hope you dont think you made a guide
TheSilphRoad,removed,the thread where some delusional op accepted myfriendsaid evidence he liked and went on rabid witchhunts against evidence he didnt like before ignoring it lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,collect pidgeyweedlecaterpie they each cost candy to evolve each evolution is a gain of that will boost you quicker you can do the same with any pokes but those are most efficient if you are running low on balls most people use lucky eggs and evolve loads of poke in one go to get per evolution you get a free lucky egg at lvs tool for evolving httpspokeassistantcommainpidgeyspam
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would also be really curious if cheating was defined in any way on this survey like corpseknight i would answer yes just because i did use maps like pokevision and sites like pokeadvisor however when compared to things like botting and spoofing theyre extremely minor offenses
TheSilphRoad,removed,posts like this are how i know the game has already jumped the shark you shouldnt have to try to enjoy a game you shouldnt have to tell people how to have fun playing a game the sad fact is that at release this game had a lot of promise and the company chose to essentially go the opposite direction from delivering on that some people are still trying to wring fun out of the game but unless theres a major overhaul ala diablo iii i think this game is going to be studied in the future as a goldenegglaying goose that niantic had to go out of their way to kill but did
TheSilphRoad,removed,could anyone upload apk please
TheSilphRoad,removed,i also need to know this i also want to know the probablility of a pokémon jumping while you jump while a ball hits i also know that i cant have everything i want just imagine everyone jumping around that shit would be awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think it just keeps the grinders to keep grinding dont get me wrong i hate it but hey rng always fuks me growlithes are pretty common usually non water cities my blastoises got steel move and ghost basic and i transfered it iv and took me a while to get those candies too the grind to keep getting more of the same pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean we get updates almost weekly so if people could calm their shit theyd see stuff is progressing pretty quickfast
TheSilphRoad,removed,from what i see on skiplagged nothing has changed however i am surprised to see so few pokemons right now dont know why yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,your psa is the epitome of a psa pointless shitpost announcement
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is exciting but still frankly should have been done before the features were removed in their partially working state
TheSilphRoad,removed,creator of your favorite show my little pony

TheSilphRoad,removed,person from africa in america african american person from asia in america asian american person from india in america indian american person from mexico in america gardener
TheSilphRoad,removed,muslims hate anything that doesnt involve their religion
TheSilphRoad,removed,renaming eevees isnt a one time thing you can keep doing it and it works every time just make sure to restart the app after naming them so it registers with the server
TheSilphRoad,removed,not sure if this is against the tos what we do is get a friend in the city to login for you and get you pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,removed,you mofos are a bunch of whinning entitled scanners the whole lot of you i am over with this reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,im just praying that they give us some kind of moveset reroller so this shit cant happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,sigh i guess ill have to wait again to find a way to have fun in this game again
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive lost of my interest in this game since trackers were shut down
TheSilphRoad,removed,so clueless
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh rofl
TheSilphRoad,removed,it shows pokémon around you and sends notifications duh
TheSilphRoad,removed,too true im waiting till to use my lucky eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,sigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,new versions are already working off the fork with the new understanding of i think that means maps are here to stay the api change has been a move they had been planning for a long time and it was broken in days its a variant of what stopped the ingress player base from making similar tools i foresee a few more updates breaking those apis again but with similar results from those who want to understand the api getting back in within a few days there will be more legal challenges followed by the projects being moved to jurisdictions which allow the reverse engineering to occur and wont enforce other countrys laws against their citizens
TheSilphRoad,removed,lolustupid evolution stones hahahaha
TheSilphRoad,removed,he is violating their terms by using multiple accounts but would you really report someone for that if you are reporting him simply because you think he bots or spoofs and you have no other proof other than your sensitive feelings then you are a whiny baby
TheSilphRoad,removed,you made a lot of great points on here and obviously many of the butthurt whiners did not even bother reading it
TheSilphRoad,removed,list of problems with your thread people who support your hypothesis have to show absolutely no proof i could say eggs no regional and you would add it without a second thought those who refute your hypothesis have to disprove a negative if i truly wanted to refute your hypothesis i would have to show a live stream video of me finding an egg and showing the location of where i am and then hatching it into an incredibly rare pokemon without even knowing i would need this in the future and then stumble across your thread if i didnt have that proof i would be called a liarspoofer the entire thread isnt about science or finding about something its just about confirmation bias youre completely biased towards everyone who disagrees with you you started with a predetermined result and then created a system that only allowed data that would support it you have an unrelated and bad clickbait title thats not even related to the research in fact its clearly meant to sway people towards your predetermined result you rely on the upvote system of reddit instead of an online poll if of the people think one way and the other newcomers are only going to see what the thinks and be swayed that way you discourage contrary evidence by calling others spoofers and start a witch hunt if i was to provide contrary evidence i would have to post my video with a blacked out name because i wouldnt want to risk a false witch hunt that led to me being banned you would then say my blacked out name is proof that i actually spoofed because otherwise i would have nothing to fear its hopeless you count some data and you dont count others your burden of proof is arbitrary and changes throughout the thread honestly its embarrassing you dont separate by and km eggs this just adds meaningless data to support your hypothesis
TheSilphRoad,removed,why is sweden known for its transformation into an islamist ridden hole
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use go radar its pretty good
TheSilphRoad,removed,head over to rpokemongodev theres some solutions out there as of late
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre right its totally fair to label him a botter because you cant comprehend how he does it go ahead and report him no one really cares ive played mobile games where i held top accounts before because my circumstances at the time made it possible he quite possibly is cheating but how you came to your conclusion was nonsensical you met him in person and didnt call bs to his face you instead ran to reddit to have a whinge about it trying to convince people that someone who could snipe that gym from their home decided to go out and switch accounts or use multiple devices to do it in real life theres too much of a gap there to prove anything and its just as likely as he spends all of his free time playing and has a situation at work that allows him some significant time playing as well do whatever makes you feel good though but dont bother sharing its really all the same to me and of the people here
TheSilphRoad,removed,current bots working w new api so i saw many people posting on outdated bots whose coders arent even supporting it anymore i went through some bots and picked the ones who has been updated and are currently working with the new api here are the ones currently working with the new api necrobot necrobotio build xp farming bot aka mass xp pokesniper my favorite catches rare pokemons across the world without getting a softban alpha release of the necrobot with gui java bot botwithme sniping ban removal lucky egg gpx thanks for checking out my thread i will keep it updated with new bots so keep an eye out for this thread sponsored by
TheSilphRoad,removed,sure whatever i really dont care this entire discussion is completely moronic and a waste of time i cant believe i actually bothered to read the replies to this retarded thread lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,imagine walking and hatching a zubat
TheSilphRoad,removed,because that one guy got caught sleeping with his ex gf based on the location thing so niantic removed it so they could keep fooling around
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokeadvisorcom gives you correct ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are endless excuses one can make to justify cheating oh my ping is not that good fuck this company for putting servers way over there let me just script cause its their fault oh my mouse is crap not my fault im poor let me just aimbot i cant spend as much time as these guys fuck this company for making their game grindy im gonna bot cause im supposed to be as geared as others who spend more time on this game its especially pathetic in this game what do you say to your friends man i went to the park with my buddies and we got so many good mons a dragonite spawned everybody ran for it and it was so exciting you go oh yeah my bot got me dragonites it was so exciting lmao a lower level shouldnt be able to take down a level just like in most games how many successful games are there where a noob can compete with veterans whats the point in leveling up if a guy green as fuck can just win against someone whos been playing for a long time i dont expect you to understand me cause your way of thinking is a lot different than mine so ill just leave one reply and let you make a thousand different excuses for why youd cheat
TheSilphRoad,removed,just use pokeadvisor its accurate and so convenient
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love how the developers call something broken when they really just mean that they couldnt figure out a way to release the game to the entire world and keep the few features in this game without stressing the servers
TheSilphRoad,removed,nifty site thanks for taking the time to put that together rpokemongo may not be worth your time its a very negative subreddit with a lot of angry folks spending most of their time decrying niantic for everything they do and everything they dont
TheSilphRoad,removed,try pokeadvisorcom it shows the true stats
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is literally the only reason mormonism ever became a thing
TheSilphRoad,removed,more like a nightmare that im prepared to handle or die trying fucking hope i never have to point a weapon at someone ever again in my life but im not ignorant to the fact that i might need to and that my life might depend on it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i used my google account and was able to login in using an authentication key valid for a single login no risks
TheSilphRoad,removed,why fix it when you can remove it niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic not so secretly likes the spoofing community and wants to help them cover their tracks
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are some mechanics that some of us take into account and some of us dont and sometimes we need to make an assumption with how to deal with it eg we know the formula for average damage is dmg atk def power modifiers now that def is the defence of the defender so when ranking pokemon whos defence do you use uprofessorkukui has ignored that part of the formula because it actually doesnt change the rankings in my sheet ive assumed an above average defenders stats ive just started to put together a summary of the mechanics and who includes what today this is my first take but will need input from the professor as its always hard to read other peoples formulas in excel metric bypokemon gopokeassistantuprofessorkukuiuqmike game outcomes metric ∝ atk def hpnnyy metric ∝ attacker atk def hp defender atk defnnna game mechanics uptodate inputsyyyy level cpm lookup and ivsynana pause between defender attacksnnhy avgdamage atk def power modifiers special moves based on energy generation from fastnnyy energy hp lost factored innnna defender hp x defender generates and stores more energynnnn no charge time for special movenanny analysis tools fast attack only if dps is highernnyy type modifersnyno pokemon matchups with actual ivs etcnhny type analysisnnny dodgingnnnn overkill damage reductionnnno
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was about to say the same thing until i saw your heavily downvoted comment i just so happen to be playing fire red right now i tested it and it looks like we were both wrong if the pokemon levels up and faints it will still evolve after the battle is finished it might be that if the player faints then the pokemon will not evolve until the next level up but thats just a guess on why we might have thought this i can upload the video if needed but here are a few screen shots as proof incase you are not inclined to believe some random person on reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,the maker of pokeadvisor noticed it as well all we can do now is wait
TheSilphRoad,removed,its also probably against tos if people care about that
TheSilphRoad,removed,funny how youre being downvoted for being right
TheSilphRoad,removed,it ran because your terrible throwing technique
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game is boring so its ok to cheat play some other game how does this elude them
TheSilphRoad,removed,such a dumb decision to add this mechanic and give so many pokemon useless moves and why give pokemon with no hp or defence defensive move sets really
TheSilphRoad,removed,you got till the end of today hurry uplazyness has bit me in the ass in the pastget out there now
TheSilphRoad,removed,but you made a comment in another thread about catching a lapras after spoofing to japan which is it fuckhat
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this explains it i always wondered if they couldnt bring themselves to make an even slightly decent game how could they make these gorgeous models huh
TheSilphRoad,removed,a wouldnt follow a lower number
TheSilphRoad,removed,sweetness i would have drove that shit all day long
TheSilphRoad,removed,why not stop playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should be improving the game for rural players not making the game worse for everyone its like everything in this world you wish for those with less to gain more not those with more to lose
TheSilphRoad,removed,prick jobs
TheSilphRoad,removed,i play everyday but ive definitely stopped being as hardcore about it in the past ive done the whole campoutathotspotswithmultiplelures thing but nowadays i just swipe pokestops on my bus commute to work fight at the gym near me on my way back and walk out of my house occasionally to catch rare pokemon if they show up on my radar app for some context im at the same place as you are levelwise the exp cliff means that leveling up is no longer something to look forward to and there arent much rewards for leveling up at my level i can basically bring down any gym thats level and below if i have enough potions and revives even pokemon can defeat a dragonite if you have of them and because i live in a dense city theres no point sticking strong pokemon in gyms anyway i guess im no longer investing much time because i feel like the game has so much potential and yet im not seeing a lot being done by niantic the crippled tracker is a big issue i dont like being forced to use a radar app but niantic hasnt announced that theyre fixing it yet so i guess im just cruising along hoping that some changes and more rewards are coming and to be honest as someone who used to play pokemon reading about all the research on movesets and types and all in this sub is whats keeping my interest in the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i always laugh bc ppl genuinely dont realize its just bc theyre leveling up technically your overall drop rate goes down every level up until bc the avg mon you see in the wild is a higher level kids hit their lucky egg and power level and then be likewhered all my great balls go ill bet they nerfed the drop rate ̵͇̿̿̿̿̿•̪●̵͇̿̿̿̿ ̿ ̿ ̿
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am shocked that anyone is even excited about this its a straight scam thats only legitimate purpose is for the small section of the pokemon community who has to have every obscure thing there is no legitimate reason this exists other than to make money watch version much better than this they are milking the games success which would be fine and id let it slide they want to make money off a piece of crap go plus if the game wasnt essentially a beta disguised as a full game
TheSilphRoad,removed,it was fun for me until lvl then everything gets away
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive actually thought about what it takes to make a game like this and the answer is not a lot i can really only see licensing and executives being the reason everything is so delayed and bad because with only we could easily make a game more exciting than pogo where you still get to catch monsters but you actually have a game to play and a reason to explore instead of playing ball throwing simulator times a day im serious too were a bunch of artists musicians and coders who have game development experience but nothing im willing to show because i dont want to blow my cover on reddit ha ha ha
TheSilphRoad,removed,best way to do it would be to have a secondary account on the opposing team and then hope someone puts something stronger in its place
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah thats another swing and miss for this list
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you just trying to see what cp the pokemon will powerup to
TheSilphRoad,removed,south america has no exclusive this was verified like times lel
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not a good game the cool ar aspect and the fact its pokemon are why we are here but mainly pokemon there is no depth to the game and nothing that really keeps you locked in and coming back for more its shallow and poorly done now to be fair there are reasons for all these things mainly but still its a shell of a real game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i should probably mention i had to go drive out of my way to a nest where there were insufficient poke stops and the spawns were spread out sure its lucky to have a nest but i wasnt just sitting in a park next to my house and raking them in i had to work for them i never went back and am still short of a charizard part of that is because it wasnt convenient though mostly its because i realized charizard was not that useful and other hunting spots were generally more useful
TheSilphRoad,removed,what app are you using to view those spawn points
TheSilphRoad,removed,confirmed as issue on huawei nexus
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its literally just you
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,if niantic doesnt add anymore pokemon the game might as well already be dead
TheSilphRoad,removed,im seeing the exact same thing in my hometown of utrecht the netherlands im thinking it has something to do with some kind of spawnpoints getting picked up as a new spawn like the spawns any chance you gathered this spawndata with spawnscan also what tool did you map this out with interested to see what my data looks like when plotted in a similar way
TheSilphRoad,removed,we are scanning a city for weeks pokémon i tried to analyze the ultra rares a totally arbitrary subset to be fair dont appear to have a favorire time of the day things that i noticed is that some pokémons do have peaks and quite hours but it may be just because they mostly comes from very few nestsffs also weekends seems to be better days for the greatest stuff and i may believe that its quite an hassle to dump the db and run google sheets over this big dataset i would like a faster and easier tools to analyze spawnpoints do you have any suggestion
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know but its really annoying i was on such a high with the announcement so excited for it to come out now im just kind of over it and simply waiting on it the game is kind of on hold for me until it comes out
TheSilphRoad,removed,well san francisco got the enhanced tracker weeks ago and i still dont have it so i dont think they are in any hurry to roll out changes soontm
TheSilphRoad,removed,the same users who forget that due to aggressive integer rounding theres no functional difference between an iv and iv pokemon right
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks android
TheSilphRoad,removed,totaalbedrag item € verzending naar nederland € sales tax € totaalbedrag € get serious pins in an envelope usd
TheSilphRoad,removed,i guarantee everyone will be able to catch a grimer between my exs legs
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres what happened there was a relatively brief time frame that pokemon was considered cool and for the most of us when we were kids it ended right before gen came out honestly it was mainly because at that point most of us were just bored of it especially trying to push that truck i dont know if youve played the first gen recently but the combat kinda sucks its glitchy as balls psychics are op etc as soon as we found out about missigno and rare candy everyone could minmax so easily so then gen comes out and for most of us we just werent interested pokemon was old hat for us at that point and sure a lot of us still played it however like i said it just wasnt cool anymore and generally the only people still playing it at school were like the weird kid that smelled like cheese and you didnt want to be a loser that hung out with that kid so you either stopped playing or played it in secret personally i stopped playing now a few years later my younger cousin came over to the house and was playing one of the newer generation of games i think it was one of the fourth gen but i only played the first gen so i may be incorrect i was interested in picking it up again so i asked him a few questions as i watched over his shoulder hey whats that thing in your party oh its an egg i gotta put it in the party and walk around to hatch it then i get a new pokemon um ok thats new so how do you get them you have to breed pokemon so like breed two of the same one and get another no you breed two other pokemon and then you get a third different pokemon but not all of them can breed with each other except ditto and sometimes they give the same move down but its mostly random then he kept going on about other things daynight cycles held items ivs hidden abilities weather effects new types that didnt exist when i played double battles move tutors just tons of things that were all alien to me hey what kind of pokemon is that youre fighting is that yeah shes an ice cream cone really cool huh you wanna play um no thanks maybe some other time now im literally at the point that as much as i would love to get back into it i am so intimidated by the whole thing i dont know how i would start i dont look down on the other generations but for me the first gen is comforting and familiar dont get me wrong pokemon go has me interested even more now but im so lost maybe i just got too old for it now
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its called travel up to an hour to a place to get a specific pokemon and walk around there for several hours missing up to of said pokemon and only getting because the stupid game doesnt tell you that they are within walking range a scanner lets you know this
TheSilphRoad,removed,christ could you imagine if niantic were as communicative as any of the companies involved here
TheSilphRoad,removed,if its not fun for you you are playing the wrong game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i had to finally make a reddit account just so i could join people in complaining that niantic cant fix an issue without causing an even more annoying issue im also having issues starting up the game as well as lag that wasnt earlier present and the problem with pokestops taking longer than normal to spit out items these arent huge issues or anything but i had a period for about a month and a half earlier this year where a new update decided my phone wasnt good enough so i couldnt get the game to work for more than five minutes at any given time until i had to get a newer phone for other issues so its making me anxious am i the only one who would rather have the false vibration back sure it was annoying but it didnt make the game absolutely infuriating to put up with at times i have to agree that niantic must not even test these updates they just throw them out and expect us to fix them
TheSilphRoad,removed,sound like you got a personal issue to me deal with it haha stop hating i didnt think this reddit channel have these trolls all you guys do is read post hate dislike and be mad at the world grow up time to put on those big boy pants and go catch em all
TheSilphRoad,removed,unfortunately there are many organisations that for one reason or another have more work to do than time to do it or are so disorganised that they only people they get around to helping are those that are noticeably annoyedangryrude when you send several comments and the only time you get one back is to complain that you called them rude names you at least then get the chance to explain that you wouldnt need to be if theyd responded to any of the previous often at this point shame takes hold and they just sort it other times they raise they hackles and refuse to help with the thing theyve already passively refused to help with so youre no worse off the squeaky wheel gets the oil as they say
TheSilphRoad,removed,if niantic could have the same communication skills
TheSilphRoad,removed,obviously all the bots are run by niantic so they can make more money by controlling the black market of sellingtrading pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope you dont have french fries you need to ketchup
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope not buying it software development practices might be better than most in the mobile gaming world but are still terrible in comparison to the gaming world as a whole each update has broken or caused issues with existing features do they even test their software vibrations bug last release server connections issues this release game cannot remember sound settings when you log outlog into the game pokemon failing to disappear when if the screen if off when the spawn timer expires etc these are basic bugs that any quality testing would surely have sorted before release im not even going to touch the ongoing sightings fiasco
TheSilphRoad,removed,all the cheater prevention is why this game so slow and laggy now extra hashingencryption trying to prevent reverse engineering its the same cause for massive battery drain and why your phone gets so hot lots of extra processing my phone now lasts less than an hour from full charge when playing pogo personally i say who cares if other people want to cheat it effects me very little but my phone being laggy and draining so fast does effect me
TheSilphRoad,removed,welcome to last week weve been expecting you
TheSilphRoad,removed,when you hatched the cleffa were you just like oh thats a weird clefairy
TheSilphRoad,removed,kennedy wasnt shot my grandpa never mentioned it
TheSilphRoad,removed,the obese one is called snorlax and the husky one is called dragonite
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was going to back up this comment but suddenly its no longer working for me on my moto x pure
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy shit really
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank god for this psa i was going crazy over this o pls send your shitposts to rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,mind blowing
TheSilphRoad,removed,no duh
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait really mind blown
TheSilphRoad,removed,did you also know that evolving magby gets you a magmar
TheSilphRoad,removed,you wont believe how hackers are making millions of stardust with this one simple trick rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly which essentially means we will be sending out another email in a couple weeks dont worry more shit is going to happen than just santachu
TheSilphRoad,removed,aha i think they really shouldnt ban people for this because it is just to solve the problem of the long animation time not to do something that is kind of illegal
TheSilphRoad,removed,ifonly
TheSilphRoad,removed,its obvious or should be that niantic labs does not test their releases on anything but a very limited set of hardware before they put it out in the wild what i find strange is the lack of coverage of this issue in the gaming community you would expect a fuck up of this order would get someones attention for a story especially considering these blogssites are desperate for views
TheSilphRoad,removed,people like you are the worst part about this sub the game works completely different for me than anyone else cause im so special theres no possible way im mistaken
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was able to get not because i wanted but because i hit the add to cart button once and it didnt do anything so i hit it again and it worked when i went to checkout i had in the cart so i said fuck it and paid for
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,ye and it isnt that good and seems pointless
TheSilphRoad,removed,lel
TheSilphRoad,removed,rough count
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am still playing this game and i love it yhen what the fhck is the problem let those that cant handle actual business properties of distribution to a whole country rage quit and never be heard of again this isnt a period in time where copanies like niantic scrape by and thus need to cater to ever human possible le them cager to their actual clients not random asshats hat dont give anything positive to the community or the company
TheSilphRoad,removed,stat moves in battle burn paralyzed etc dat reading comprehension doe
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep the baby pokémon are as useless as real babies dreading my eggs more than usual
TheSilphRoad,removed,really lame promotion tbh
TheSilphRoad,removed,money grab trying to get us buy incubators
TheSilphRoad,removed,the optimist in me says tyrogue but the pessimist screams shitty late relatetofansvideo
TheSilphRoad,removed,the silphroad is confirmed apple fanboy
TheSilphRoad,removed,you could make the first and the last together if you take the hie ivs a for example its lot shorter d
TheSilphRoad,removed,please search
TheSilphRoad,removed,this slow randomized rollout is asinine i dont get it never seen any developer do it this way
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope get a legit phone thats not breaking the law by ignoring the term of service from your phones manufacturer
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont believe so i believe the definition of a nest is an area that spawns several of the same species over a sustained period of time since it is particularly one specific point that spawns it i think it would be categorized as a habitat i could very well be wrong and if i am sorry about that
TheSilphRoad,removed,this means right omg im so happy lol i know its just a game but holy fucking cow im excited to have gotten this beast httpimgurcomkozzaay httpimgurcomgcfzmfw httpimgurcomcdyldqz
TheSilphRoad,removed,bye dont come back anytime when gen comes okay
TheSilphRoad,removed,google
TheSilphRoad,removed,its for every joelton which indeed makes it very unlikely
TheSilphRoad,removed,completely stupid how can we provide areas with pokemongomaps then
TheSilphRoad,removed,got the muk from a egg still havent ever seen or got a grimer
TheSilphRoad,removed,how do you find out million spawns in an area im a noob on that front just curious because id also like to find out what spawns around my city thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,how do you make this study any program i´d like to do this in my city too
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know that video actually and i might do this but my spoofing account only has one lure left gotta spend it wisely
TheSilphRoad,removed,where do you find this info for your specific location
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not too impressed by it honestly im glad they havent rolled it out to everyone yet as that gives me hope that they are considering a different solution for the tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,raichu jenner
TheSilphRoad,removed,jesus guys seriously how long is it going to take them to roll this update out im tired of waiting
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi im john hanke i made lots of money without communicating with my games player base im going to chill with soulja boy now drops mic exits stage
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,any tutorial on how to get this data for myself
TheSilphRoad,removed,btw poster is seriously dedicated to catching pokemon i sometime wonder if trainers in gyms arent botters or spoofers but electric rabbits set up by niantic obviously odds are much better to hatch lapras but wtf knows
TheSilphRoad,removed,the re process will probably depend on how many devs actually care about this game anymore app statistic sites peg pogo as having lost of its userbase since launch
TheSilphRoad,removed,it was spoiled for of the subreddit including myself sorry you lost seconds of realizationexcitement in your life youll have to find a way to get over that its like not even close to a big deal and you probably wouldnt have discovered it on your own had you not read about it here i really dont feel bad like at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree
TheSilphRoad,removed,everybody downvote op just to troll him
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is so dumb niantic come on
TheSilphRoad,removed,a post so stupid that he made it twice lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,can you use more bolding and exclamation marks i didnt quite get your message
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah kid everyone just got it today no matter the location i know for a fact location means nothing as to whether you get it or not at any time dont try to argue with me its pointless im right
TheSilphRoad,removed,the host better ask about the eta on a worldwide tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,the people want answers but it will probably be the same ol stuff
TheSilphRoad,removed,quit shitposting
TheSilphRoad,removed,shouldnt have launched it before finishing it
TheSilphRoad,removed,or instead of expanding it take out tracking and the ios battery saver then put it the latter back without fixing it
TheSilphRoad,removed,enjoy your pidgeys
TheSilphRoad,removed,imo he should have been asked about the tracker and the awful balancebattle system
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like the game but it kinda makes me said nitendo isnt involved would be a better game imo but that would make it less profitable for niantic so i understand why
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes necessary detail to add i feel like it is niantic decision only wheter it does or not since phone uses gps any way and sends coordinates to server it is up to them how to interprete these coordinates just watched ceos talk he focuses on walkingfitness when talking about wearables would be really strange if their store brand device will work against it not tracking distance may be all that sites mean that pogo itself does not track distance no shit sherlock may be my wishful thinking
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats a lot of negative stuff to me theyre not planning pvp anytime soon theyre not planning any major events soon theyre not considering adding to the pokedex soon sowhat are they doing in the nearfuture anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry the interview was all softballs with none of the import questions either asked or answered i love the heck out of this game i also am growing more and more unhappy with the company im aware this is massive and takes a lot of work however they do not communicate even in an interview they still manage to not say much of anything i dont like it not one bit
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly just because of that im down voting op lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would love for pvp to be implemented that would bring so much more excitement than gym battles
TheSilphRoad,removed,so the thing i am most excited for is just a probably i am less excited now
TheSilphRoad,removed,weve launched the first gen of pokemon of it was always the intent to introduce more over time people talk like were getting gen in the foreseeable future but based on everything theyve been saying it doesnt seem remotely imminent
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok so signatured apk files are used as promotion
TheSilphRoad,removed,this for sure forget ivysaur and grimer this is some awful shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i also found a squirtle earlier today i wonder if this is even really a bug
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard i guess i am done playing pokémon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not sure why you were downvoted the dude thought that pokemon a game played and easily beaten by children was too complicated for the public at large i cant say i disagree with what youve said
TheSilphRoad,removed,so pokepatch is not compatible with poke go
TheSilphRoad,removed,not sure why the root block was not mentioned even once at least from the transcript in the op i would have loved to hear their justification for locking out legit paying customers of their game because of a common practice on android
TheSilphRoad,removed,hearing him talk about pogoplus and say its meant for using while walking running and biking angered me so much since you cant hatch eggs or get buddy candies while doing of those things
TheSilphRoad,removed,nice now lets everyone post about nests in their cities
TheSilphRoad,removed,take your terribly unfunny meme and go back in your hole
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon go made a cultural impact unfortunately niantic has done everything they can to drive off their user base honestly the game was much more fun with the aid of scanners the new pokestop tracker crap is not that much different than a party app except it is completely garbage and shows only things most of which are flooded with commons essentially both point directly to a pokemon that you desire but the party apps actually worked well i miss the days of travelling all over town scoopin up rares or scanning my neighborhood while at home and then hopping on my bike when something cool pops upwhen niantic started with the bans i stopped with the scanningthe most fun i had was when the bans started going out right before i quit using map scanners i was manually moving around a little scanner buddy rather than have it automated it really felt like using my pokemon buddy to help hunt now with tracking completely dead in favor of pokestop scanners i will only ever have memories of when pokemon go was actually fun to go out and play back when hunting was an activity before niantic lost track of what a video game is
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes i always wondered about that particular hypocrisy from this sub when most of the nests reported are discovered by trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,no no that is a new added feature
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know i cant really be offended by it like so many of you are here im in an area with a few nests but most are a drive away im not going to suit up in the middle of winter and go drive to every single one of them every two weeks in the hopes that a nest will turn into one of the two or three nesting species that i still wantneed i just want somebody else to do it for me if they use an app to do it what do i care the difference is invisible to me and i benefit all the same i get that its less pure but whatever ive been playing this game since july and im not spending one of my precious free evenings driving an hour round trip to find that a nest is oddish again it feels really petulant and naive of me to say well im not going to drive out there but by god i want a human not a robot to go look in that park for me because that makes me feel a bit more selfrighteous
TheSilphRoad,removed,aaaaaaand nothing new
TheSilphRoad,removed,having hundreds to thousands of bots catching mon across the world isnt helping this person cheat wow til reported for spam and supporting an admitted cheater
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpslmgtfycomqpokemongoivexplanation
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you asking a question about people asking questions being stupid did you try google first
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive only ever spent money from google opinion rewards but i would never spend actual money due to all the bugs in the game as a general principle i dont give monetary support to halfbaked qalacking software
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think they started off as a company that were just idiotic and rude to its users and now theyve really started to listen and the perception of them is really changing theyve definitely done a lot of positive things in the last months compared to the first months of pg
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah as if people who know me dont think i already play this game enough now let me just go into a phone store take a photo of myself in said store tag it with a bunch of promotional hashtags and post it to my personal social media account nahim good
TheSilphRoad,removed,this will probably never happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow you mean we can do all the things we can do everywhere else at sprint stores thats incredible
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just shot clue goo all over to
TheSilphRoad,removed,sad that her thighs arent asobvious
TheSilphRoad,removed,definitely some pc bs that probably caused the change
TheSilphRoad,removed,boring update boring hidden stuff i had faith niantic would release the rest of gen to do a christmas even with delibird the christmas pokemon but i guess niantic wants us to stop playing the game lol we don´t care about cosmetics or hats in a pikachu we want real new content ffs niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,meh
TheSilphRoad,removed,disappointing just disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,new gloves and socks sounds like that horrible christmas gift you get from year old grandma good to see these huge changes coming before tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor booty fixes minor tush fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is freaking huge no not really the first one was huge
TheSilphRoad,removed,gtfo we dont need your measly help
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems pretty nice although still a big disappointment no gen no legendaries no nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,itll probably end up being a disappointing skin and nothing more where the egg icons are replaced with presents during christmas but functionally identical to before
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game isnt even competitive what are you so upset for they might catch em all before you then what the spirit of the game is catching pokemon and the radar niantic developed is broken so people fixed it themselves its a native feature that doesnt work api hack coding something around an api is not a hack
TheSilphRoad,removed,how the fuck i use the iv calculator i dont understand this one
TheSilphRoad,removed,the battling in general is pretty lame
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon with higher stats will have higher cp combat points the number above their head in the game important to note is to not forget the last and most impacting stat the pokemons level that is displayed on the arc over it this is the only stat you can affect by power up and it has much more influence than all ivs of the time the reason one pokemon you caught has higher cp than another of the same species is because it has higher level however since you can affect this stat the level you will want to max it out if its an important pokemon so once you max it out you can consider that stat equal on all your pokemon and what makes this pokemon better than another of the same species will be its ivs and its attacks
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres literally no fucking game mechanics here you throw a pokeball at a random spawn and then you might dodge and attack on a gym whenever it doesnt fucking crash on you yes weeks was more than long enough for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,this would explain why my egg hatched into snorlax who happens to be a baddass moterfuckerand i havent even touched that candies he came with d
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry but wtf i feel like the true burden for this moral dilemma lies largely on niantic for sending so much information over the wire in an easily mineable format are you out of your god damn mind lets flip some words around there i feel like the true burden for this moral dilemma lies largely with the woman who was walking down the street at night in a dress that allowed her to be easily raped i feel like the true burden for this moral dilemma lies with the homeowner who left his front door unlocked and easy to rob i feel like the true burden for his moral dilemma lies with the kid who was walking down the street in a bad neighborhood and was easy to shoot with the stray bullet during that driveby do you realize how ridiculous it sounds to say that the company is at fault for you deciding to break the law
TheSilphRoad,removed,so far for me whatever pokevision says is there is its been very accurate in both location and timing however i also occasionally get a few extras that were not on pokevision
TheSilphRoad,removed,is lousy with tauros nbsp pokéstops approx approx walking the loop starting in the parking lot coming down the trail on the other end through the neighborhood and returning to the parking lot nbsp notes on what this fairly simple hike is like
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just made a simple site where you can log in and it will display all your pokemon with the exact ivs the site can be found httpwwwpokemongonexuscom use with caution since it uses the niantic api which has not been given permission
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know what that is why cringe
TheSilphRoad,removed,try to imagine a lvl gym full of blissey that is train by using bubble strat its a hell of a pain in the ass destroying that thing we already tried before a lvl gym full of chansey and no one bothered hitting it for a week and after that it was taken down by a bunch of stupid cheaters lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i hate to break it to you but only programs and all but are failing of the really low standards set by the government not to mention those are still failing with program failing all versus say having programs of which are failing none and only failing more than one category failing or even worse the heavily scrutinized and both with significantly better performance than full sail
TheSilphRoad,removed,her is the publicly available email of the person who proposed this sheldonwassermanmilwaukeecountywigov unless they are writing legislation of making use of easily accessible online contact information as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,please dont let this somehow be related to trump
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont want to be a grammar nazi but this is to much please read your own post before posting
TheSilphRoad,removed,long live spoofers
TheSilphRoad,removed,weooweooweooweooweoo did you just assume somebodies gender im pc ill throw down
TheSilphRoad,removed,icons for both of glooms types show apkplz soonanswerback
TheSilphRoad,removed,feelseuropeman
TheSilphRoad,removed,not exciting in the least rural players still get nothing and i dont know anyone that would be convinced to switch cell coverage to sprint due to pokestopgym addition
TheSilphRoad,removed,im in arizona so ive had the tracker for awhile before the new tracker i had caught snorlax in the wild not common but every few weeks id get lucky and find one after the new tracker i have not caught a single rare pokemon in the wild screw the tracker unless pinsir counts i also saw a ninetails on the tracker once that i didnt bother with because it was on the other side of private property at a pokestop far away
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol only m i forgot i did m in the one week xp event
TheSilphRoad,removed,the click bait will spread from reddit to those dodgy add filled sites and youtubers new pokemon its just an update they will give
TheSilphRoad,removed,can you pm me the code and number unless its for sprint employees only id like to listen in
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont read us is getting pokestops and gyms read heavily urbanized us cities already overloaded with pokestops and gyms are getting more in order to further stick it to rural players who are potentially hours from the new sponsored locations
TheSilphRoad,removed,see my other comment thanks for the clarification im at work so i can not check links
TheSilphRoad,removed,in the burbs with quite a few spawn points i typically see distant stops with rats and pidgeys i get no good feedback on whats spawning close to me at all i live in snorlax country i have i have caught since the change nothing remotely interesting is ever on the tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,can i ask how you where able to write that without uthesilphroad catching you for being a troll i would love to know i cant type in a bad word a child could say without being caught for perpetuating a negative environment reported btw
TheSilphRoad,removed,i get porygon but dewgong was one of the last three shit do you live in the mojave where theres no water my last two before porygon were chansey and snorlax
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn not as exciting as i thought itd be lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow not gender inclusive niantic my buddy dratini does not identify as a male or female
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
TheSilphRoad,removed,its most likely holiday costumes for pokemon models during the holiday season one of those cute little cosmetic things that games do with such occasions missing out wouldnt affect you
TheSilphRoad,removed,gonna snipe that fucker so many times
TheSilphRoad,removed,you missed out the part where its been named penis
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was told child porn pokémon go is xxx and a felony in the us
TheSilphRoad,removed,but isnt that just specifically for the apple developer enterprise program i thought that the apps via enterprise are designed specifically for organizationsenterprises and they wouldnt really be publicly available for download i could be wrong though havent had much experience with enterprise compared to testflight seems like it would be doable through enterprise but like you said it also sounds like a technical loophole that apple might frown upon
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont forget about the gems in pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,why npcs youre the first person ive seen mention that in a request for an update
TheSilphRoad,removed,for harambe
TheSilphRoad,removed,for real having iv with right moveset is like a first edition charizard in mint condition vs a bent up one yea same functionality
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think creating a secondary account for this thing alone would be feasible
TheSilphRoad,removed,after one test sigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,create new accounts
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can gang up on a gym to take it or train it really fast on your own you can level a bunch of accounts over and over again in order to get free lures to use you can catch doubles triples etc of any rare pokemon you find eventually being able to trade them to your main account or simply give you an advantage in the trading economy its standard fare for an mmo to not allow multiple accounts per person i dont think its as big of an offence as spoofing so they should let you keep one account but ban your others
TheSilphRoad,removed,why did you make them almost all the same color
TheSilphRoad,removed,back when pokevision was working there was one near my work from out of no where a colleague started talking to me delaying my lunch break by so when i got on my break and checked pokevision there was a chansey with only left it was easily a walk im still sad to this day thats the closest ive been to getting one was squashed by a colleague
TheSilphRoad,removed,i didnt think about that before but now i realised i saw lapras on the mappokevisionlike and it was friday i am sure like weeks ago last friday lapras spawned on a lured spot near fountainran after first razzultra though so if its correlate with other reports it is true does anyone know any lore behind that
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am sure the number one is the right one jynx is quite common here and i get a lot of them from eggs it is very anoying when i still had no scyther and pokevision worked i scanned a lot of areas far away but accessible to me and found a scyther nest next day i drove there and catched a couple and got egg too i was happy and drove home next day the egg hatches and gives me a frigging scyther there is no way that was just rng i had never seen scyther and then boom i hatch one just after visiting a scyther nest
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can download the pokenet app it has the largest collection of nests in mobile app format over across the country that being said adding more every day ios google play
TheSilphRoad,removed,warning i strongly suspect this was the reason that banned one of my accounts strongly suggest using httpspokeassistantcommainivcalculator or something that doesnt directly interface with the account
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,reported cheating doesnt have benefits folks
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres what you should do that you might find more rewarding find a gym with your team and take a look at the first opponent you want to be able to defeattrain against him with one of your mons with a lower cp if you can do that the gym gets prestige for that battle you also score some xp click the run away button and do it again keep doing that until you raise the prestige of the gym to the next level and make a spot in the gym for yourself put your highest cp mon in the gym hopefully you become the gym boss bit if not just try not to be below the lowest its much easier to hold a gym thats already established than to start from scratch start with trying to get two mons in two different gyms at the same time click to cash in and enjoy your gold coins and stardust the next day try to increase it to gyms last night when i cashed in i had gyms my best haul yet max is dont take it too seriously its just one aspect of the game and is an interesting wrinkle in what is otherwise a game with lots of grinding and chance
TheSilphRoad,removed,so meta
TheSilphRoad,removed,what no way
TheSilphRoad,removed,we have an organized group of instinct players recently someone set up a bot to monitor all of our normal gyms and attack them when we prestige them i would have thought just spoofers but no spoofer could do this every time we go to prestige in the last days tho the gym we are training gets attacked within seconds of us starting to train they sit at lvl instinct and never go up there is no way to beat that no amount of organizing can do anything against that we all report it but no help from niantic of our main gyms are unusable by anyone now this is game ruining we could pick other gyms but they can do the same thing elsewhere andor on a larger scale so dont give me that crap its up to you to deal with it no niantic needs to fix this it shouldnt be on us to work around malicious cheaters
TheSilphRoad,removed,judging by the daily posts with this exact title posting a thread about it on the tsr subreddit will probably solve the problem
TheSilphRoad,removed,it would be nice if they invested some of that revenue into finishing the base game and a new ceo
TheSilphRoad,removed,in retrospect i believe the halloween event was more user friendly because niantic were desperate to reverse that downward trend now that they know what their baseline revenue will be events can be squarely aimed at profit
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think they should at least give away free incubator on a day streak im at the point again to not invest in incubators because it is such a slow grind and im always having eggs in the pipeline during the event i was willing to spend coins and money on the incubators to get many of them rolling i think they would make more money if they give out free incubators daily or at least for the day streak
TheSilphRoad,removed,dead game s
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats really surprising because honestly i feel the halloween event was the best followed by thanksgiving and then the recent one honestly the baby pokemon dont interest me so they added absolutely no value to the game singleuse incubators is nice but in my opinion double candy and double xp were miles and miles ahead in terms of usefulness i was honestly just thoroughly unimpressed with everything that happened from december until now i already had multiples of the starters i dont give a rip about pikachus or raichus with hats ive hatched over eggs without any free incubators and i couldnt possibly care less about the baby pokemon they have always been useless even in the original games i spent less time on the game and less resources than ever this past month i guess its a good thing for niantic that everyone else totally loved all that stuff and im in the minority i was seriously worried about the game after what i considered abysmal and lackluster christmasnew years events
TheSilphRoad,removed,lg here and have very little issues with gym lag or errors
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not going to argue the semantics of a feature vs a bug weve called bugs features befite and spent months calling features bugs step tracking bug i will say fir a fact that the first time i hit i was impressed it felt smooth and cool then i tried throwing and fuck after it happening a few times i quickly learned to close out and restart to get rid of that shit throwing curves is awful it takes full revolutions of the ball to get the sparkles started as opposed to less than one revolution just a sweeping motion spins are harder to spin pokemon harder to click it changes all the motions of the game for all i know if i had fps all the time id relearn how to spin stop or tap mons just as effective but theres no way that throwing curves would ever be the same swoops is alot of motion by comparison to hell with that
TheSilphRoad,removed,what you are describing has nothing to do with the graph accompanying this article good try though
TheSilphRoad,removed,they wont do any work none at all they invent a pattern in their head by ignoring the nature of rng and then immediately post about what theyve found wrong wrong any post without days of accurate and verifiable data collection is just garbage and should be getting downvoted if you see a pattern there is absolutely not excuse to post about it before doing several days of data collection to verify disprove or quantify your theory yes absolutely but the reason for that is that they do sy research my point is please tell them that they did sy research and dont suggest it already has been researched by falsely claiming its rng because we dont know that
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this isnt the first time ive seen this so i need an explanation how the hell is muk considered a giod defender let alone top tier hes a poison pokemon and the ubiquity of zen headbutt confusion and other psychic moves even on nonpsychic pokemon seem like he would be weak to sooo many pokemon snorlax exeggcutor slowbro and alakazam should all completely shit all over muk and thats not even the full list where am i going wrong here
TheSilphRoad,removed,just ask for an eta s
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i really thought the whole thing was pointless without this option
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow this is autistic
TheSilphRoad,removed,relaxo is leaking
TheSilphRoad,removed,it depends on where you live
TheSilphRoad,removed,wtf just call it what it is this is pokemongomap from github with probably spawnsearch extension i use the same with workers for covering my whole city and my townfacebook group loves me
TheSilphRoad,removed,duh
TheSilphRoad,removed,just seems that valor has the most people who do sketchy cheaty things in my experience
TheSilphRoad,removed,these mechanics are incredibly bad im glad i stopped playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i want more stuff thats easier to get post at its finest jesus christmas
TheSilphRoad,removed,what appwebsite is this
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres how it works you park in front of a level gym for attackingtraining it up til you open a slot then go to select a pokemon to place as a defender at this point the game crashes and you have to reboot once youre back in you go back into the gym menu and notice that someone else has been sitting on their couch watching you from across the street and as soon as you prestiged the gym they immediately stole the and final spot you worked so hard to achieve thats how gyms work until niantic does something about the rampant sniping problem
TheSilphRoad,removed,what pogo map is this
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi my dad is niantic and he said no it will just be a fluster cuck of laggy tapping and pointless switching
TheSilphRoad,removed,also for those players at uwaterloo i have my phone on me while i play i can take a picture of your plate and i have police on speed dial i will call it in every single time the campus police jurisdiction is fairly certain pogo will cause more than one death due to general stupidity based on current trends
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe a check box that simple asks how many donald trump signs do you see out in the yards
TheSilphRoad,removed,i bet all profanity is censored yay for big brother grow up silph road
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude just check the faq or something there was a crash at r pokemongo dont shitpost here stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,get out
TheSilphRoad,removed,and what will happen with the people in europe that are already playing and lvl thats the real question how can you fuck up this bad at least writte something on your twitter acc niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,at least you have something apparently asia south america and african dont even fucking exist
TheSilphRoad,removed,shut up all u crybabies are gonna download it the second its announced
TheSilphRoad,removed,im going to beat all the kids
TheSilphRoad,removed,we remove threads about specific areas friend as they tend to snowball into tons of folks asking about their hometowns d
TheSilphRoad,removed,its like that for me too i live in florida where it officially launched and unless i use an incense i dont see shit pokestop within miles and a gym at miles
TheSilphRoad,removed,big fucking deal
TheSilphRoad,removed,hell yeah i really wish i could play and enjoy columbus area right now but for whatever reason im the only one of my friends who cant even fucking log on right now such bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,amen
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant wait to have it in hand dont you mean cant wait for it to drop be ridiculously buggy then work later
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is
TheSilphRoad,removed,filthy casual watch some baseball
TheSilphRoad,removed,the server overload is not a myth ive seen it waterworld
TheSilphRoad,removed,supplemental isnt meaningful with the distance to candies and candies to evolution each pokemons evolution line can be thought of as total distance magikarp is km dratini is km charmander is km caterpie is km etc
TheSilphRoad,removed,fury cutter only has an attack damage of and i feel like it often feels like it does so little damage bug bite seems to pack a much bigger punch it would be interesting to run the numbers and compare the net damage to the defender that two similar cp bugs one with fury cutter and another with bug bite can deal out i think the low base damage force of for fury cutter really makes it subject to rounding down to no bug pokemon has megahorn so ive never even considered it in the analysis but i agree that its too slow to use and puts the attacker at too much risk for getting their ass kicked i know how to dodge and how to time attacks especially with both confusion and zen headbutt having such long animations and ease of dodging xscissor is hard to use in my opinion the animation time of seconds with having to hold down to deploy it i just havent timed it well enough against a confusion exeggutor that i can reliably attack with it between dodging fast attacks taking a full power stab damage just once in a fight is not worth the risk for me when im trying to max prestige against an exeggutor most of the time like i mentioned earlier you cant just do the math because the and its not just counting up the damages and adding them together this is the formula for dealing damage damage floor this means the attack power for fury cutter and for bug buzz is halved multiplied your attackers level scaled attack score divided by the defenders defense score and adding the stag and super effectiveness multipliers each this value is then rounded down to an integer value and is added to it in theory this should benefit low damage high rate attacks but i think damage is just too low and it very often barely registers a sliver of damage per turn bug buzz might deal as much damage per attack than fury cutter if say fury cutter deal gross damage that gets rounded down to and bug buzz deals a gross of rounded down to also since you have to use xscissor more times to get the same total damage you suffer from damage scaling and potential misfires ie holding down too soon before the previous animation is done and not actually deploying or letting go too soon and not actually deploying the attack
TheSilphRoad,removed,these people be like would be so much better if i just opened the app and got ten gyarados as a bonus 🙄
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe
TheSilphRoad,removed,my data are perfect hatches perfect catches hope that helps with your data
TheSilphRoad,removed,slap yourself in the face
TheSilphRoad,removed,aim your phone towards the gym and shake it up and down it will be detected as walking and your character should move just a little until the gps decides that its far enough
TheSilphRoad,removed,tldr i now agree with you but i have some questions about how this may be exploited wow that was a roller coaster ride initially i was locked in my opinion that the transparent trust system is just far too damaging to casuals who shouldnt be forced to treat trading with the same scrutiny you reserve for significant financial investments yes it will mean that occasionally you will lose a pokemon some friend got from a shady trader and traded to you but if thats the price to pay for a relatively cheatsafe system im willing to pay it but those words which ive heard before in other forms somehow got me to envision a snorlax going poof and realizing itd be fine itd be great that it was actually worth something in the first place but then i switched into devils advocate mode so when they ban the cheater they delete everything that cheater ever owned here is how i still buy a nearperfect whateveryoumon from a chinese botter on the cheap i go to ebay and buy the cheap rare pokemon onto an alternate account this account never cheats he is intended to look like a dimwit i use this account to trade for a legitimate nearperfect whateveryoumon from an honest player in the town over as well as a couple other trades and some actual play i know how to act normal for a few days i now have a legitimate nearperfect whateveryoumon on my dummy account i trade it to my main who is also lost in a sea of actingnormalness how does niantic deal with this it is not hard to figure out everyone gets to do it a couple times you only need a couple elite pokemon no need to be greedy they delete everything that cheater ever owned the cheater ebay bot seller never touched this whateveryoumon do they delete every pokemon involved in every trade with any pokemon that was deleted is that possible with the trade path or would it require more than just the trade path to be logged this could be it im just wondering how much that multiplies the collateral damage the pokecoin fee would keep it within some amount of reason or actually if that was the result maybe it would prevent the market from ever getting to a point of needing to do huge damage to honest players who simply trusted a guy at the park
TheSilphRoad,removed,your post is pretty good specially because ive been using something similar to hatch eggs using gps instability too since the beginning that the gps while idle tends to walk around alone when gps is difficult to detect so i just parcially cover the fone in aluminum foil and put it in the bathroom worse reception in the house over night plugged to the charger you can get every night with this technique using the same principle you could get the gyms next street
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh look at mr fancypants who has more than one stop to choose from must be nice living in the big city with all those spawn points s nottotally
TheSilphRoad,removed,shut up and take my upvote
TheSilphRoad,removed,listen this guy
TheSilphRoad,removed,without they tracker this is how you look
TheSilphRoad,removed,my experimentation on it and its why i threw up my hands in the air and went on hiatus with the game indefinitely is that the speed sensor is messing it up as soon as the game thinks youre driving ie moving too fast it will take things away from you then when youre still the pop back up its maddeningly ridiculous im not saying things dont decay as youre saying im saying they disappear and reappear if you have gps drift anything its terribly broken
TheSilphRoad,removed,any real reason why not players have been decreasing a limited increase in pokemon spawns could draw in people and generate some money for them
TheSilphRoad,removed,yay ill be able to catch more weedles and pidgeys on halloween i wasnt excited for the this year but nowwow
TheSilphRoad,removed,if everyone got the moveset they wanted gyms would be boring extremely predictable gyms are boring and predictable mind meltingly so also the game is completely unbalanced they basically skewed every pokemon and attack with a rng and punished the high speed ones most are completely useless not by intent but indifference the only balance work they have ever done is a slight change to move dmg because some abilities like water gun had like the dps of most moves
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you hate the game so much delete the app and quit posting on this sub negativity isnt welcome here
TheSilphRoad,removed,wouldnt say the servers are stable i still get disconnected at least times a day
TheSilphRoad,removed,then why bother commenting an awful game
TheSilphRoad,removed,not likely they are not going to make any effort to recover the lost player base as is evident by the choices they have made the past few months
TheSilphRoad,removed,so would a tracker at any point since launch
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have a bit of a weird sensation in my elbow but im putting on a brave face and pushing through it
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game itself has never been better than it is now if youve never found it enjoyable i dont know why you would still be here
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is how we find ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,id like to see how that line collapsed until today
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think they should give us a working tracker and stop trying to kill every solution that the community got
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic be like lol they srsly think we release
TheSilphRoad,removed,excellent idea but i dont think niantic is that creative
TheSilphRoad,removed,yea which makes zero sense first thing that came to my mind too
TheSilphRoad,removed,this makes them total idiots not sorry
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont have a windows phone but if this really works that is so awesome to many apps dont see any love outside of androidios and its nice to see other platforms get the same experience we do
TheSilphRoad,removed,the poor ingame tracker didnt have anything to do with the subject presented here the subject was how fast niantic got the servers to a stable point with the expected traffic which i think they handled well if the topic was on the ingame tracking system your post wouldve made more sense but to voice displeasement over the ingame tracking in every discussion unrelated to the tracker is not adding to those discussion and just annoying to read we all want a better tracking system but for circlejerking over it you gotta be in a different sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,well it reduced their traffing by at least when all that people quit so yep they completly sorted it
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats what happens when you make a graph to display information while at the same time trying to best to hide other more sensible information it doesnt make any sense
TheSilphRoad,removed,someone shouldve told them to stop sorting it by now
TheSilphRoad,removed,they should have known better its a freaking free play game with a gamefreak and nintendo ip on cellphones in which everyone has there are non name brand crap games that arent free to play that are above niantics estimate its like what were they thinking
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah and hows it going with the wii fit also
TheSilphRoad,removed,more rares that you cant find more pidgey spawns fixed bugs and caused worse ones in the process better gym battles unless you actually do a lot of gym battles ftfy
TheSilphRoad,removed,no x value no y value months late info for something we all already knew or at least suspected cool
TheSilphRoad,removed,ever heard of a company to be that stupid to release how big their exact margin is
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one will be playing if they dont drastically change the meta or combat by gen they havent even mentioned a timeline for legendary pokemon yet it will a year minimum for gen combat is simply nor fun for most people no way will any real amount of people keep playing when their dex is full
TheSilphRoad,removed,sooo why do they hardly communicate
TheSilphRoad,removed,even if they pop for you you can always take that shellder tongue and put it on the cloyster
TheSilphRoad,removed,this
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes i adjusted my clock min ahead of gfs and now we spawn at same time if not mine a little sooner xp
TheSilphRoad,removed,they have the money to develop content but so far they have not shown the capability to do so i mean the game has fewer features than at launch but many more bugs i hope they can improve the app but so far it has been step forward back
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like how they used encounter and not find because find would imply i was tracking them down or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,so pokemon is not in a state in which we can be proud of it they are making that much money but cant even spare money for a community manager currently the game is in a state which gives me no reason to spend any money for it
TheSilphRoad,removed,ever heard of google cloud if traffic is greater then you can expand your infrastructure automatically but then admitting that would leave you without your precious excuse
TheSilphRoad,removed,predator would be more pleased by running his lickitung up and down an xl diglet
TheSilphRoad,removed,and despite this they cheap out on qa or opening offices in another city to hire more people to make the product better
TheSilphRoad,removed,til half of pogo community is disabled i didnt expect anything else tbh
TheSilphRoad,removed,for that matter bring the three step tracker backlol i dont think servers will crash anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,well now it cannot happen since niantic doesnt do anything the user base wants
TheSilphRoad,removed,new api has already been red scanners like fast pokemap will be back up within a few days
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have that awkward moment a lot
TheSilphRoad,removed,except pad never ruined their game
TheSilphRoad,removed,nailed it pr gimmick confirmed i am fairly certain they get access to those pictures taken with the app and all they need is a for a few people out there to snap some great ones so they shift it into some good press not that theres anything wrong with that but theres something unethical about rarely ever talking to your player base and then indirectly soliciting them for advertising material
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah so when do the rest of us get this wonderful new accurate nearby tracker hasnt the bay area been enjoying their shiny new beta tracker functionality for like two and a half months now sure would be nice for niantic to roll it out to the rest of us because i think most of us here are getting pretty infuriated with our highly unreliable tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,but the game is dying guys
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a great scam that was
TheSilphRoad,removed,have you tried foreplay
TheSilphRoad,removed,it definitely isnt fpm expected to be up within hours
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally i can start playing again s
TheSilphRoad,removed,he has a very weird online persona arrogant rude i will admit that at least he gets stuff done i guess ¯ツ¯
TheSilphRoad,removed,love that guy
TheSilphRoad,removed,he has quite the unique personality and is quite arrogant he is providing a desired service to a lot of people that want it thoughi wont say for free since he receives donations and ad money but he isnt charging for the service
TheSilphRoad,removed,to be fair were horrible at adhering to those rules its an exercise in futility if you ask me if you want a community as finedtuned as the created of this subreddit seem to they shouldnt make it public it should be invitationonly people come here to talk about the game in pretty much any fashion whether the creators intended for that or not thats how it is and no amount of moderating will magically change that
TheSilphRoad,removed,enough about trackers already this isnt supposed to be remedial urban orienteering spend minutes learning how to triangulate its not hard
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like him he isnt my temperament as i try not to insult people even when they deserve it but what hes doing is great and i have respect for him
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh no looks like that thoroughly exciting gym game will take a hit oh wait gyms are still a stagnant joke the best part of this game for most people is running around catching pokemon and without trackers you cant do that very well this will improve the game for most people
TheSilphRoad,removed,he said he doesnt make money off of fpm cant confirm or deny anything without proof though
TheSilphRoad,removed,she
TheSilphRoad,removed,easy there with the hyperbole its not hundreds of thousands of spoofing bots or even close my large suburban city of people was able to be covered with about bots to keep the timers above minutes people got really efficient with using the minimal number of bots to complete their scans server loads are no longer an issue for pogo until niantic provides some sort of in game tracker youre not going to get much agreement from the larger pogo community with your position
TheSilphRoad,removed,sounds like incentive to get a useful tracker in the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,at least heshe gives what we ask for ive donated more to fpm then i spent with pgo when i talk to remaining survivers all of them are waiting for fpm get back online and there is a consensus that without trackersscanners they will quit soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,according to him he made nothing actually he says everything is going into the servers
TheSilphRoad,removed,you might have missed it i just did my edit but its hard to triangulate this joke of a system when you cant even trust what it says is near you is actually near you and by the time you get far enough way for it to fall off the tracker a couple times to know when it is or isnt you probably already lost it to despawn you shouldnt need advanced skills in triangulating positions to find a creature in mobile designed for people of all ages
TheSilphRoad,removed,most of those who he attacks are complete dumbasses who tweet him specifically to piss him off
TheSilphRoad,removed,woo nest mapping time soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,months without content for weeks without bots worth
TheSilphRoad,removed,having a game with new content is nicer than watching an endless battle between an arrogant developing company and an arrogant software engineer
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly i would rather deal with the bots than keep playing without a tracker fighting gyms just isnt much fun to me anyway and being able to spot a specific uncommonrare pokemon i actually need and joggingbiking kilometers to reach it is a lot more fun than just wandering around aimlessly and never finding anything but the same nine commons that make up of the spawns in my town
TheSilphRoad,removed,reading that article for seconds i feel that a lot is sweeping the nation these days
TheSilphRoad,removed,my experience has been that the triangulation method is nice in theory but in practice it has not been very effective once ive worked out whether ive walked within or whether its just spawned figured out where it is and then walked the or so from the edge of the bubble to the spawn point its pretty easy for it to have despawned
TheSilphRoad,removed,the funny part is that the higher battery drain is caused by the lot of useless calculations in the code whats purpuse is just to slow down reverse egineering having maps again
TheSilphRoad,removed,no tracker when finding rare pokemon can lead to depression
TheSilphRoad,removed,so no update news
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hold gyms that gets me stardust every day as long as i hold them of my gyms will never go down and pokecoins thats quite a bit of progression
TheSilphRoad,removed,i believe the powercore and powercore are httpwwwpowerbankguidecomankerpowercorevsastrothedifference that the astros for what thats worth as i said ive got a powercore and it can keep up and ahead of with pokemongo running continuously anecdotal evidence is anecdotal p
TheSilphRoad,removed,fucking casuals i swear to god reeeeeeeeee
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol my luck is so bad with these mobile games got a bulbasaur with a km egg fk me
TheSilphRoad,removed,pls explains what the fuck is going on here
TheSilphRoad,removed,next patch they are introducing hardcore parkour for those people who dont think there isnt enough skill in this game basically niantic is teaming up with the developers from mirrors edge to create an amazing experience
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game is not fun anymore without the ability to actually track and chase pokémon its an entirely different type of game now which is more like playing a slot machine where you walk instead of pull of the lever i was continuing to play in hopes that it would be fixed but i guess this game is dead to me now so sad
TheSilphRoad,removed,the step thing is a big part of the gameplay and the fact they havent fixed it just tells me its probably not as easy as a lot of people think well it was working before most people suspect they turned it off to help with server loads so yeah thats pretty shitty because it means theyre spending time playing around with avatars instead of fixing pieces that are the core functionality of the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,to get people to talk to eachother or team up to find that dragonite sounds good in theory that is if there wasnt a timer on pokemon with a minute window it just isnt possible because in reality that window is smaller so youre not going to get social in that amount of time the game is too quick for that if the pokemon windows were a half hour or more ok that i could see but minutes nope not happening
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not a permanent removal but if a feature is constantly going to cause problems then remove it until it can be fixed so that the many users that arent aware of the problems associated with it wont encounter them
TheSilphRoad,removed,well wander aimlessly for minutes and then the other minutes are like an idiot because we know the spawn time on pokemon caps around minutes
TheSilphRoad,removed,this aggression will not stand man
TheSilphRoad,removed,personally i think niantic is doing their best i like the part where the ceo claimed that tracking websites were bad without acknowledging that the actual tracking system in their game happens to be completely busted
TheSilphRoad,removed,the hillary clinton policy also lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,could you explain hoe did my eevee evolve into a vaporeon but became after i strengthened it then
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you cant fix it delete it yes because broken features are confusing and annoying
TheSilphRoad,removed,mvp wasnt minimum enough
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly id expect people in rural areas to be used to being far away from anything interesting
TheSilphRoad,removed,you might want to do research before you open your mouth you can use a calculator and you just put in your cp hp and stardust cost count and then you have your ivs and can compare to any and all others of that species
TheSilphRoad,removed,imagine the poodle corp kids fix it that would be awkward wouldnt it lol well if they do hack the game on monday then good i didnt want to play anyways
TheSilphRoad,removed,do ivs change when a pokemon evolves
TheSilphRoad,removed,no i didnt
TheSilphRoad,removed,so removing all tracking is somehow fixing tracking k
TheSilphRoad,removed,why would anyone want to do that you simple retard how could that possibly sound fun to you
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol found the guy that never played the original games
TheSilphRoad,removed,except that it did work after release the first week the game was out you could find pokemon based off the number of footprints displayed
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant wait to try it i always threw curved balls intentionally
TheSilphRoad,removed,mate with the sheer number of botters in here no one needs your data
TheSilphRoad,removed,its clear a lot of people have never played an mmo before i mean seriously what kinda performance do they expect from this generation of shitty smartphones with poor battery life whiners will always be the majority always
TheSilphRoad,removed,yo im not a bot back off my account name on pokeadvisor is i logged in and was for valor prestige but i had no idea id be ranked this high im guessing this was seen as an unreasonable prestige number but its not i just gymfought against a bunch of weedles with abra because the abra would the weedles you cant do this anymore if you and like people stack a gym this way with samecp pokemon you gain like prestige per fight you can could continually do this in spite of the abras low hp due to the factor i was definitely parked at a gym sitting in a car listening to dragonforce and shitty justin bieber remixes for all of the prestige acquisition it might have looked weird but i was definitely doing all the button presses
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not the worst idea to cover up the ui of a buggy feature until it can be fixed
TheSilphRoad,removed,leaves have never ever meant anything to me i have yet to see a single spawn after walking over them one way then back the other way then the other way then the other way then dang its gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,when i actually run in to a good enough spawn i just yell and let people locate me by their very good ear radar
TheSilphRoad,removed,hats off to niantic theyve had such a rough weeks oh yeah they have it so bad making million a day i feel so sorry for niantic s
TheSilphRoad,removed,we are confident that safety concerns are a primary concern of niantics leadership in this change that is total bullshit not being able to track pokemon has nothing to do with safety its because it reduces the stress on the servers
TheSilphRoad,removed,well the problem is they have a track record of removing things from a game promise that a solution would come only for years to go by without having the feature reinstated and no eta on a fix example ingress portal submissions so and i mean this politely get off your high horse
TheSilphRoad,removed,your app obviously isnt welcome take the hint buddy
TheSilphRoad,removed,let me translate niantic and nintendos wishes we know our game is broken we dont care we enjoy your suffering now give us lots of money
TheSilphRoad,removed,people are only hurting themselves because it takes some fun out of the game it surely feels less fun now
TheSilphRoad,removed,free service with add revenues
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow thats a lot of fake ptsd hate it when people dilute the meaning of words to feel special
TheSilphRoad,removed,right but at the same time the current version of the game is unplayable these services allowed us to still enjoy the game im not sure if i even want to bother trying to hunt down pokemon at this point if i cant even rely on the provided tracker defeats the whole purpose of the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,people are only hurting themselves because it takes some fun out of the game you that you do but you dont dont tell me how to have fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,hahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahhahhahahahahahahahah
TheSilphRoad,removed,welp started playing days ago and was only level guess theres no point to this game anymore just walking around hoping to find that dratini that is always steps away is kinda stupid cant even breed pokemon feelsbadman time to grab my with omegaruby and start working on vgc format
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokevision going is really going to be the nail in the coffin for this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,we dont all live in central park or in the middle of tokyo this game makes no sense without a decent way to find pokemon for of the people niantic will find this out the hard way
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant have anything getting in the way of that nsagovernment spying tool
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats me done dont fix the footstep bug and close down the only tracking site all i have to do now is aimlessly walk through my rural town with pidgeys and weedles it was fun while it lasted
TheSilphRoad,removed,if tracking actually worked id be okay with this but it doesnt at all a main part of the game is broken and its bullshit trying to track down pokemon blindly pokevision helped solve this
TheSilphRoad,removed,but what piss me off that they dont ban gps spoofers cheaters first but block this
TheSilphRoad,removed,is it really that big a deal i went across the road to get a nearby growlithe still havent found one ended up spending half an hour walking around never got him did meet a bunch of people burned some potions getting some gym xp walked about the game is literally about walking around mission accomplished i got some exercise and still had fun ill find another growlithe one day
TheSilphRoad,removed,john hanke is an idiot
TheSilphRoad,removed,in lieu of the in game tracker we were able to use party services like pokevision now we still have no tracker but also dont have any other way to find pokemon it is just walk and hope i run into something now
TheSilphRoad,removed,aaaaaaand they ruined everything seriously im not going to wonder through my city with no hint about the position of the pokemon under ° heat just to find a rattata that makes me waste and then escape no thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,when using pokevision i could maybe find an eevee or something similar in rarity km from my house i would actually walk there just to get it now i wont find shit so i guess thats the game for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,someone has not bothered to search do we need this reported every few hoursseriously just stop
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah man faulkner park albert lake and the tan is where its at
TheSilphRoad,removed,do not dispute it you arent going to win a gray area against google just sideload it we dont allow apps that interfere with disrupt damage or access in an unauthorized manner the users device other devices or computers servers networks application programming interfaces apis or services including but not limited to other apps on the device any google service or an authorized carriers network you are accessing niantics services in an unauthorized manner period end of discussion however what you should be doing is letting the game die stop giving people reasons to play a game you arent getting any money for this niantic is niantic has given the middle finger to the developers and the trainers by letting the bug persist for weeks let the hole fill with a community and then throwing dirt on the community september is rolling around kids will be back to school adults will be back to football the fall season of games will be released warcraft battefield cod etc give them what they want a dead game
TheSilphRoad,removed,open the game oh there is an arcanine near walk for minutes the arcanine is still in the radar restart the app arcanine has dissapear from the radar there are only pidgey and paras rage shut down the app go home and open another game the radar is completely broken it doesnt despawn pokemons when they are out of range this makes that pokemons in your face won´t appear and pokemons km away will fill it the user experience on trying to catch something is completely frustating and worthless
TheSilphRoad,removed,you dont need steps below the pokemon to tell you that theyre on the top left of the list youre right but being on the top left of the list means nothing right now because it doesnt actually represent which pokemon is closest or furthest away its just one of nine pokemon that are within a m radius of you thats not how it was intended to be played youre right the game was intended to have a working tracking system but it doesnt so the community came together and created working alternatives we cant enjoy the game the way it was meant to be played because the game itself is broken whether or not tracking sites are fun is subjective i would still have fun hunting with friends but i can understand if others feel it cheapens the game but asking the community to enjoy it the way it was meant to be played when it literally cannot be played the way it was originally designed to be played is a bit moot
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wont play without pokenotify thats it
TheSilphRoad,removed,you mean the random persons providing the only functional bandaid for the flaws created by the highschool level development and deployment of the game i still dont understand how a major ip property is released in such a poor and undeveloped state the number of minor bugs in the app is still staggering they still dont even have good exception handling for the errors trying to log into their crappy back end this is its well understood how to design apps and backends for scalability even more confusing since they had a trial run through ingress its rude to say but id be wary of any technical resume that lists pokemon go or niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here on windows
TheSilphRoad,removed,server errors one is bullshit how do you think pokevision worked it posed as an user playing the game pokevision asked the servers hey i am standing here could you send me all the pokemons in the area server responded with pokemon names and coordinates for these pokemons the app itself had to calculate the amount of steps by doing a simple calculation it has nothing to do with the servers it was turned off because they didnt want it to exist not because of the server issues
TheSilphRoad,removed,a very handicapped version of a real pokémon game yes
TheSilphRoad,removed,people should just gps spoof like all the top twitch streamers since thats what niantic wants anyway there is literally no point playing this game anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,masturbate
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a fucking joke one of the few ways this game was still playable was being able to locate and hunt down pokemon niantic is spending its efforts shutting down this core feature instead of fixing their shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you have one gripe about rpokemongo its that it is too negative today yeah sure all the previous days kids getting upvoted to for saying stupid stuff like im glad the game isnt filled with ads or its so nice that to be able to launch the game without restarting the game my phone fucking times
TheSilphRoad,removed,myeah fixing the nearby functionality by just removing it altogether and then asking sites like pokévision sites that are doing their job to shut down ill keep my hat on sorry
TheSilphRoad,removed,its either i stop playing or they fix the foot prints and start being interested in the people playing their game and giving their hard earned money for these expensive ass poke balls and also the incubators its interesting i just bought incubators and put them on eggs and ended up not walking around i check hours later and both incubators are missing and so are my coins still im extremely unhappy with niantic and they have zero class
TheSilphRoad,removed,this game is giving me all the above ptsd espeically
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,am where are the codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,its guys
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop masturbating
TheSilphRoad,removed,find out next time on dragon ball z
TheSilphRoad,removed,but nah guys lets hate on niantic for removing a feature that doesnt even work
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol retard the api is something you have to code the connector for you dont code the api itself
TheSilphRoad,removed,does it matter the game is dying and rampart with bots it takes hours of botting to get a lvl account depending on where you farm dragonites galore now
TheSilphRoad,removed,is not working says invalid access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,no are you joking
TheSilphRoad,removed,they were making million dollars a day the game had more active users than twitter within one day of release the niantic team are currently getting blown one by one by miranda kerr whilst they do cocaine off of each other the glib rip xdddddddddd from reddit autists in here is really quite jarring they won virgins this game was more of an overwhelming success than anyone could have imagined im sure you and your mates star review from akron colorado because they wont spawn larpas outside the front door of your population town wont phase them you dont complain about having to go into the city to watch a concert or see a sports team they are not going to spawn the best pokemon where no body lives its not perfect but doing spawns by mobile phone usage makes sense surely you see that vent if you wish but please take your arrogance and we win if we stop playing attitude elsewhere this game had more users than every single other mobile game ever combine they win
TheSilphRoad,removed,the technology just isnt there yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre all guilty itll be interesting to see if they recover because the playerbase right now is in niantics eyes a bunch of spoiled cheaters whove had their cheats taken away the entire launch community was spoiled by the original concept of footsteps to hunt a nearby pokemon then when that broke the new meta became using online webapps with maps to find the pokemon which spoiled them even more by being able to pinpoint and go right to a pokemon with perfectly zoomable coordinates hunting was no longer a matter yes in a way this is probably cheating whether you want to call it that or not it was a significantly more efficient way to acquire rare pokemon than was originally available at launch with decreasing footsteps from to to to none near the damage was done though and its obvious now that niantics leadership decided that they would cut their losses and accept that spoiled launch group will leave their game and hopefully they can get their game back to some sort of mode they originally conceived of hunting rather than being a game that you sit at home waiting for some spawn worth going outside for to pop up in your web map on chrome but right now without the footstep tracking the game is just a walking slot machine where you can definitely find gyms but any pokemon you find are pure stumbleupon chance outside of the slightly increased odds of finding a geodude near rocks or in parks a ghost in a graveyard at night a magikarp by a lake whatever
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpwhoisdomaintoolscompokemongocom httpwhoisdomaintoolscompokemonpromocom the official one has contact data the fake promo one is anonymized and vastly different in details
TheSilphRoad,removed,you cant even argue with what i just said if tracking is dead third party tracking is dead and theres no way of knowing youre even going the right way to get to the one you care about then why would most players bother
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre clearly a moron as it was a joke to start with the more you know worm
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah confirmed hasnt hit puberty alright im done here one last thing read this article and read the comments yes everyone of those people disagree with you and agree with me now go argue with all of them gl lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i doubt niantic will even ban cheaters at this point
TheSilphRoad,removed,if thats the case thats more people gone you eitheir play following the rules or you play a different game
TheSilphRoad,removed,if thats the case thats more people gone you either play following the rules or you play a different game
TheSilphRoad,removed,so what web app isnt run by a bunch of fucking cowards
TheSilphRoad,removed,without power leveling youll build a team of low level pokemon that youll inevitably trade away for higher cp versions youll find at higher levels or youll sink a large amount of stardust to maintain your teams level or you can grind for candy god all of these options are shit why am i even playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,ps cricket and baseball are two entirely different games a pokemon game vs a pokemon game are not two entirely different games you have got to be kidding me
TheSilphRoad,removed,photos for evidence
TheSilphRoad,removed,shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemon go would be a total shit show if it was a zerosum game people killing each other to get the monster first thats insane its great that people help each other and can work in teams
TheSilphRoad,removed,wit two months get in line with a bag of and buy the bracelet from nintendo when its released
TheSilphRoad,removed,i answered some guy earlier ill just paste the reply and edit it a bit to suit your post better besides the lack of communication being the main issuebecause people are just angry at the complete disregard and disrespect niantic has towards the fan base without whom it would have a dead game and a bankrupt company its a twoway street but other than that its not just changing something its about the removal of half the games core to explain in as short as i can when the step feature worked it was a game of tracking catching pokemon when it failed and pokevision came to be it became a game of chasing catching pokemon as you ran across town before that countdown hits but now theres neither of those and its a game of just just stumbling onto pokemon and throwing a ball at them still a somewhat slightly fun concept but now its just half a game on top of that many people even before the game released already complained that the game is too shallow and lacks a proper engaging battle system like the real pokemon games and now having them remove half the games core and making it even more shallow naturally results in a lot of disgruntled players as for your last sentence thats exactly the problem we are looking from their point of view and all of us can see from their point of view that they dont give a shit about us because any of us from year old kids to year old chief executives when looking from their point of view realize that the only way we wouldnt communicate with the community at all is if we simply didnt give a crap about these fans
TheSilphRoad,removed,fuck niantic i mean not enough that ill stop playing of course but still fuck em
TheSilphRoad,removed,haunter
TheSilphRoad,removed,is this legendary event for real or a scam
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats not niantic though thats some other dude
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats some nobody hireling from the crummy pr company they hired
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill do one with you actually i usually get pidgey rattata clefairy spearow and eevee around my house ill pop an incense and see what happens also this sub has always thrived on getting real data im glad to help as well will post updates
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol they are retarded they can comment on this issue but not anything else
TheSilphRoad,removed,they kinda do
TheSilphRoad,removed,this needed its own topic its about as attention seeking as those toxic posters in the other sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,no theyre shutting down trackers cause they dont want other people fixing the problems with their game that they cant
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe stop viewing these sub reddits as different factions because the majority of both communities are the same people
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is a shitty sub reddit for this
TheSilphRoad,removed,get over yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,because niantic didnt put a single thought into the spawns they cut and pasted from ingress
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a bad design of the system not exactly a bug and i dont think it was intended per se maybe this can be reported to niantic so the progress can remain after evolution
TheSilphRoad,removed,they cant honestly expect to launch in china while blocking rooted phones all the chinese phones would be blocked from playing how stupid is this guy
TheSilphRoad,removed,pvp for sure wouldve kept more casuals in it
TheSilphRoad,removed,well the winner of a would get no credit for distance in the game because they were too fast maybe he means the average con attendee would be the real winner here because they wouldnt exceed the hanke speed limit
TheSilphRoad,removed,good question and the most imortant one niantic is pretty slow with major updates the buddy system used existing code and it took a while to be implemented
TheSilphRoad,removed,says the playerbase is still massive and engagement is going strong there are plenty of people playing the game trust me chuckle but theyre trying their hardest to kill that player base starting with the last update
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game still feels like its in beta lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,one step forward and two steps back with every update
TheSilphRoad,removed,wew lad
TheSilphRoad,removed,spawns just changed on the sept httppokemongohubnetpokemongospawnpointschangedtoday and they change about every days httppokemongohubnethugechangespokemongonestsspawns wonder if theyd change it sooner for the update or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,im excited for these events he speaks of but if it takes months or years to be able to get a moltres or mewtwo i dont think there will be many players left who are willing to wait that long
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop hogging all the dildosi mean dittos
TheSilphRoad,removed,there was a chance to convert some of those people into players or at least casuals
TheSilphRoad,removed,this was my stopping point as well think the grind on top of the lack of features is what slowed me down im still waiting for them to make the game how they imagine since you know they barely scratched the surface but its taking forever for little features to come out
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have a samsung mini with which should b ok for the game but i get the you shall not pass message that my os or device or software is not compatible my friend has the same phone with the same android version and she can play i tried reinstalling the game from google play i tried restarting my phonebut i guess i would have to hard reset my phone and install pogo first to see if it works and if it works install my old apps one by one to see which one is not compatible with pogo right but i wont do that because its a big hassle flip you niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres an even better tracker in the making
TheSilphRoad,removed,for some reason after a few questions i felt like i was watching an unfunny episode of silicon valley he said so many buzz words and typical ceo things the whole weve leveled off but were growing because ceos always have to say that jeeze
TheSilphRoad,removed,in other news throw pokeballs at pokemon to catch them
TheSilphRoad,removed,im level literally everything except stuff escapes pokeballs and runs away after escapes need to use great balls on virtually everything seems like i wouldnt catch a dump with this thing
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only have having issues is you cuck
TheSilphRoad,removed,when will see pvp hanke has a old son who wants to battle his friends mentions buddy system will probably make its way onto the roadmap but i dont have a date for you its something that will probably make its way onto our roadmap this is an awfully casual answer for the requested feature by a large margin probably make its way onto our roadmap
TheSilphRoad,removed,apparently yes and i guess itll work and more people will buy the for it
TheSilphRoad,removed,no greatultra balls is pretty lame imo unless its a rarestrong pokemon i use pokeballs before greatsultras so i have only pokeballs while i have great and ultra balls
TheSilphRoad,removed,so up to now go is ios exclusive not available for android devices
TheSilphRoad,removed,jesus so they literally could count everyones distance with phone locked right now but they wont till we buy go plus go to hell niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,for just you can buy a bunch of incubators and hatch all your eggs at once so you dont need to check
TheSilphRoad,removed,only using pokeballs sounds idiotic also ill keep an eye out on go catch rates if its a average of bad and good throws then using pokeballs with this kind of chance would be too much to lose
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here huawei phone im upvoting every single thread like this hoping it will get some attention from niantic its one thing to slowly roll out an update or to have some bugs or to have a far from finished game but this pisses me off beyond measure
TheSilphRoad,removed,good you ruined the game i dont know how anybody is level already
TheSilphRoad,removed,this doesnt have a gps unit in it right so they could totally be doing the proper gps tacking with low battery usage already
TheSilphRoad,removed,just buy mine because of this
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that was a whole lot of nothing cheers for the writeup
TheSilphRoad,removed,how do they manage to make these interviewsappearances without dropping anything new man i would be disappointed if i went there
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is kinda frustrating to me so this means they could theoretically let us track distance with our phone locked but they just simply dont unless you buy the device i m still not going to buy it as i find the go plus kinda ugly and i wouldnt wear it but if it would look like a ordinary android watch i would probably get it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i actually did root my phone because fire os is ugly this is the first time there have been any problems whatsoever with it i feel like im being punished for fricking changing operating systems
TheSilphRoad,removed,did you read the post jeeze
TheSilphRoad,removed,so the app can use a bluetooth pedometer to track distance with the app running in the background and the phone locked but it cant use the built in pedometer in virtually ever phone with the phone unlocked and the app running this really needs to change
TheSilphRoad,removed,youve not posted what phone youre even using my guess its a chinese clone using an android os im sure there is a thread on here about this
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup i think he just sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,is essence what your doing is playing tap your watch simulator not pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,screw this company and their broken game
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are a joke i am not even rooted and never had been and i cant play the game shame on you
TheSilphRoad,removed,well this seems like a useless waste of money waste pokeballs and minutes on a zubat while a snorlax derps next to you unable to be caught by regular balls
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah this is niantic so nothing of this will happen forget
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is very aggravating that niantic insists on treating all of their players like cheaters i had to jump through a series of hoops to get my phone prepped to run the game not only that but ive found in this version of the game that if you loose gps for any reason the game automatically assumes your cheating if youre attempting a catch that will break out and dodge if youre just idle waiting on spawns you will not get any spawns even though your phone has triangulated your position being on the ground floor of my apartment building im now unable to play while inside i must be outside to get a good gps lock receive spawns that wont dash on the first ball i throw even at the library with a popular gym there is a nice overhang that you can hang out under while battling the gym well on sunday there was heavy cloud cover and that combined with the overhang meant a flaky gps lock if you were trying to battle under there you would be frequently kicked out of battle with error and then no gps found this never happened before this update
TheSilphRoad,removed,at which point theyll do the same thing they did with all the tracking apps have them removed from the respective app stores
TheSilphRoad,removed,all you guys in this thread make niantic hear you post to their social media and leave a star rating on google play lets just hope they recognize they made a mistake
TheSilphRoad,removed,guess you need a account then
TheSilphRoad,removed,it doesnt andnshouldnt make sense because background processes like bluetooth communication is old hat just look at the inordinant amount of wearables that are in constant communication with our phones fitbit jawbone garmin oura iwatch s watch etc etc if anyone thought for a moment that niantic wasnt capable of running their distance tracking and other operations as background then they are foolish we can and should hold niantic to the standard of the available technology
TheSilphRoad,removed,can i have it not catch things for me i honestly just expect it to waste pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,removed,hanke uses struggle its not very effective
TheSilphRoad,removed,they would make less money that way
TheSilphRoad,removed,we intentionally crippled our app to inconvenienced to buy our device for only to fix it i can see why this wasnt marketed as a main feature
TheSilphRoad,removed,psa when i search for this topic this is the only post that comes up at all psa theres no mention on this on the front page that i can find psa i didnt know this read this sub often and found the info useful also psa you can inform people of rules without sounding like a total jack ass also also psa also psa psa thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,doesnt matter where you hatch them theyre already decided
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah this restriction is completely ridiculous im glad i heard about it when i did because i was planning on buying coins that day
TheSilphRoad,removed,they really expect us to go to some meet up to catch a legendary pokemon mfs got work to attend they should just put them into the god damn game already
TheSilphRoad,removed,reported
TheSilphRoad,removed,what the shat
TheSilphRoad,removed,not limited to snorlax dont put anything strong into the or last if levelrd slot
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn right minimum viable product
TheSilphRoad,removed,walking distance and notifications of when a pokemon is near when the phone is locked absolutely its incredibly awful design that the game needs to be running in the foreground eating our batteries to do something that countless pedometer apps accomplish just fine while the screen is locked
TheSilphRoad,removed,well if youre in middle school yes
TheSilphRoad,removed,well thank god something was moderately well coded
TheSilphRoad,removed,for tldr look at base stats and ivs together is what this post is saying this is old info though
TheSilphRoad,removed,did you just assume its gender maybe it doesnt want to evolve
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats normal its part of the experience
TheSilphRoad,removed,we dont fix bugs there just added features niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,god why is everyone so hostile to this huh cant people be nice for once please
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool name bro
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we report this as a bug a few hundred times this is the worst change yet i thought they didnt want people walking and staring at the phone this change basically forces you to
TheSilphRoad,removed,sheeple cringe
TheSilphRoad,removed,i quit
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is awful i just get more frustrated each time its not a spawn
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean the nearbysighting fix they made isnt the greatest more like a bandaid fix but it was fast they cant develop a tabs system immediately honestly the only thing i care about are stop submissions but that seems to be at least a few months off
TheSilphRoad,removed,i already disabled music and sound effects i guess vibrations is next
TheSilphRoad,removed,good lord im glad i havent had any of this happen since i updated hope this doesnt take as long as most bugs to get fixed
TheSilphRoad,removed,comment
TheSilphRoad,removed,who asked you ask sponsors you see niantic needs more money they make money from sponsored pokestops so they need you to visit poskestops as much as possible hence the annoying af vibrations whenever something spawns near a starbucks pokestop a mile away how else would they make money not by making an engaging bugfree game thats for sure
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is truly remarkable that they continue to add these subtle enhancements that harm gameplay
TheSilphRoad,removed,its absolutely ridiculous of the time nothing interesting shows up in the nearby list im sure everyone here periodically checks the tracker when were in the game so these constant notifications are unnecessary and obtrusive terrible idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,does sound rediculous
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah to be honest i would also be pissed in this situation where are you playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh good that means theyll fix it quickly just like the volume control issue oh wait
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is an extremely obvious bug to spot times easier to reproduce than the weedle capturestuck bug from a while ago one does wonder if they actually hired any tester and if they test their stuff at all before deploying a revision
TheSilphRoad,removed,were excited that theyve acknowledged a bug i actually wish this sort of post wasnt newsworthy sadly it is boy are expectations of them are low
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for the update
TheSilphRoad,removed,and why would they do that this is the average give us free stuff thread
TheSilphRoad,removed,shitposts that way rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just used the bathroom
TheSilphRoad,removed,this sub is not a complaint department for niantic shitposts go back to rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,i never said it was just me and yeah im sure its perfectly reasonable to expect a large amount of players to spend hundreds traveling to multiple continents in order to complete a mediocre free mobile game
TheSilphRoad,removed,but they still refuse to acknowledge some things like the audio glitch
TheSilphRoad,removed,step in the right direction i hope they allow us to either toggle between both or just shut one off entirely sightings isnt perfect but nearby is an utter failure in both concept and execution
TheSilphRoad,removed,this would truly be the best gift of all

TheSilphRoad,removed,always i am used to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsimgurcomgalleryielbx
TheSilphRoad,removed,when i hit last weekend it seemed to update instantly is that supposed to be a humble brag we dont care
TheSilphRoad,removed,shes too low leve
TheSilphRoad,removed,if the client continues to get updates while in the background is there any possibility for another app to peek into the clients memory and see the update so it can generate an alert when there is something wonderful in the neighborhood
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,quick someone the servers so we can find out for sure
TheSilphRoad,removed,john hanke just really doesnt like harry potter movies
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you normally come on reddit to complain about your blind wife
TheSilphRoad,removed,happens to me too annoying
TheSilphRoad,removed,so yeah niantic reduced pokeball chance and increased potion chance sucks i guess it is another reason why i always run out of pokeballs these days
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes thats why its in quotes dumbass
TheSilphRoad,removed,duh guys his mom wasnt shiny so yea
TheSilphRoad,removed,andrew t gilbert house which is listed on the national register of historic places properties and sites listed in the register as well as those located in and contributing to the period of significance of national register historic districts became eligible for the federal tax benefits i dont quite see the logic in stopping the public from gathering in places designed for the public to gather especially ones funded by tax payers dollarsdonations its what its meant for and we pay for it this particular example may not be the best case but library sate buildings public parks ect just hire more staffsecuritylandscapers maintenance crew its your job and this we dont want to deal whit it because they are playing a game is bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,never go full retard
TheSilphRoad,removed,is it shitpost season already
TheSilphRoad,removed,if people wanna remove their ability to be pokestops thats up to them i hope theres a system for which a business is actually the one asking for its removal but thatll happen in time and businesses can always ask to be put back in if they get removed if a cemetery wants to not have random people walking in thats up to them as players the best we can do is not cause problems see trash grab it if a worker comes in one day and sees dozens of times over the trash hes used to seeing hes gonna ask wtf then when he learns its the pokeymans hes gonna ask more questions then if he learns he can stop it from happening hes gonna loitering is just existing where someone subjectively doesnt want you to if you create a situation where they dont mind if youre there its just existing thousands of businesses have embraced pokemon from malls to shops to bars to even museums and cemeteries theyre not all gonna think alike but actually helping the situation is gonna you know help the situation
TheSilphRoad,removed,you dont have to subreddit hashtage to ask a question
TheSilphRoad,removed,still so many spoofers and bots so no money niantic make it right
TheSilphRoad,removed,it got me back into it and it was so much fun i would go longboard our veterans parklibrary area and could hit pokestops in depending on how many pokemon i catch even then there where some hills and i would only register about of my distance it sucked i wasnt hatching eggs as fast but longboarding the hills and hitting all the stops made up for it in fun now it looks like im completely sol and probably wont register anything this is a real blow to my drive to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,which means riding a bike is now too fast to hatch eggs thats fucking stupid niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,not when you account for cp
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is hardly relevant to pokemon go at all the only real advantage it gives in this scenario is an increased receptivity to using the scientific method something that is also found in every nerdy yo who thinks science is wicked cool bro
TheSilphRoad,removed,first of all that doesnt answer my question or provide me a source for either ideas second of all wasnt it silph road itself that crowd sourced the data disproving that idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,im incredibly low on potions to the point where i cant train anymore i got like pokeballs greatballs revives but so few potions my phone lags if your phone doesnt have flawless fps training is a nightmare of time i end up in a situation where trained pokemon kills mine with less than hit away from his own death
TheSilphRoad,removed,no it isnt bottom third implies there is a top and middle third which would make it be cut horizontally on top of which if you google bottom third of mobile screen youll be linked to hundreds of pages all over sites such as tomshardware talking about the bottom third horizontally of the screen it seems just because i had trouble understanding all the people who did understand have grouped together to become high and mighty with the downvotes and big headed explanations
TheSilphRoad,removed,unfortunately the problem with this strategy is that it ultimately relies on potions now that the game releases more pokeballs per pokestop i have absolutely no potions i cant train a gym for shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,its just common sense to not burn poke balls on a red raticate or golbat i am starting to get way more selective now rather than just catch everything its a time thing too i could catch a couple of pidgeys in the time i waste on a pinsir or whatever and pidgeys are my lucky egg evo xp megafood also in general feels like shit is starting to get hella repetitive
TheSilphRoad,removed,the hulk ball happens to me consistently pain in the ass
TheSilphRoad,removed,fox news and many other outlets have shit reputations but they continue to pump out bullshit cause it makes money money reputation
TheSilphRoad,removed,whwhoa thats the biggest devaluation of candy idea ive ever seen your posts best quality is its disregard for opposing view points its failure to recognise the decline in dental health oh high level pokemon due to candy consumption is great too its definitely got some good stats definitely thats what i think see ya
TheSilphRoad,removed,can someone please tell me how to makes those heatmaps a link or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats what she said
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,right i cant do that because of my location and lack of a car but in any case spending dollars for one more gym is financially a bad trade off
TheSilphRoad,removed,putting all that time into go is nothing to brag about though

TheSilphRoad,removed,make yourself a cheat account and purge them a friend of mine is still cheating has multiple rare max cp pokémon is level and doesnt get banned my whole town is infested with level arenas most of the trainers are cheating and im annoyed by it i will not invest any money into the game anymore because the multiplayer part of the game makes bo sense for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah its not the walking around outside part that makes it sad its the amount of time taken to get to at how much experience it takes jesus
TheSilphRoad,removed,so how many pokestops do these countries have p
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can beat a cp poliwrath with bubble ice punch with my cp electabuzz with low kick thunder its a brutal fight but its awesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,walking in a loop for hours a day yeah he is a loser
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you on drugs
TheSilphRoad,removed,ipod mini is for girls
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can has root no pokemon is kill
TheSilphRoad,removed,ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,kids might get killed by drones as a mistake for programmed bomb vest i dunno
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally the people in tajikistan who own a smartphone can play pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally borat can catch them all
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool tits now back to tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,go away
TheSilphRoad,removed,god damn mongorians
TheSilphRoad,removed,too bad the game is virtually dead at this point
TheSilphRoad,removed,but people in the previously rolled out countries who have root continue to get the middle finger even if they bought stuff ingame
TheSilphRoad,removed,do they even play bro
TheSilphRoad,removed,trainers be like
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah im sure its real safe to walk around with your phone out in those countries
TheSilphRoad,removed,the old nest atlas is absolutely horrible people see a certain pokemon one time and then report it as a nest like idiots
TheSilphRoad,removed,and verweggistan
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemonno
TheSilphRoad,removed,it seems that a walk would make good to you
TheSilphRoad,removed,unless youre swimming in dust and are sure you wont need any of it later powering up past is a huge waste of ressources
TheSilphRoad,removed,tldr op is a moron
TheSilphRoad,removed,see my comment mark the area using any of the websites or apps that mark circles
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre an idiot yes you can outpace an attacker i do it all the time its exactly how niantic intended the gym system to work does your pokemon train the gym up enough to place a pokemon httpimgurcompcawupd
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol get over yourself ive caught plenty by your def of fair and square the problem is once you have maps and ppl have used them to catch rares you cant take it away because the bar needed to compete has been heavily raised you need to not be able to find a few dragonites on the nearby and youll change your mind pogos tracking system is utter aids and its infuriating when you cant find something that is incredibly rare when it finally comes on nearby
TheSilphRoad,removed,there a million ideas about the game floating about i think there are main complaints that niantic needs to address tracking priority number if they arent going to be able to return tracking for liability reasons they need to tell the community that i have never heard this rumor confirmed pokemon diversity regardless of what your favorite pokemon was in the gameboy games odds are you cant use it in gyms in pokemon go either base gym rank on level or normalize cp so that all pokemon can have a chance at top spot in the gym end game is nonexistant as soon as you complete your dex the urge the quit is overwhelming the grind levels up so exponentially that goals like leveling or powering up your approved pokemon are too distant to be motivating finding and holding gyms is the most unfun gameplay i have experienced yet in pokemon go i managed to avoid a lot of driving and sitting still so far in the game with gyms youre forced into driving around a lot and sitting in parking lots
TheSilphRoad,removed,no anyone with seconds of time can do this its just that niantic is incompetent or unwilling to add features to their game they literally do not care
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive participated in these discussions multiple times suggested many ideas myself and seen the same thing suggested later again and again and all we get from niantic is stuff that barely anyone cares about the buddy feature was the only thing that was barely useful appraisal it has absolutely no useful purpose other than to the ocd types looking for that perfect iv pokemon making training easier why its easy enough already badges that increase catch rate by wow thats huge they know what they need to do fix bugs working tracker fix rural problem fix gym sniping etc its been repeated here literally hundred times but they just dont seem to care at all there is no hope for this game and when i say game sadly i use that word ironically
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcowpastvrepokemongomaphlen
TheSilphRoad,removed,not in my city cp dragonites are very common in gyms in my city my city had a poke tweet so did the surrounding cities here is how poke tweet worked some hacker ran tens of thousands of bots to scans the entire city for rare pokemons the scan results were automatically fed into his twitter account we subscribed to his twitter account everytime his bots found a dragonite snorlax lapras or anything rare or special we immediately got an instant tweet notification the notification included the the pokemon name its iv moveset a despawncountdown time and location if we were interested we could tap on the little map in the tweet it opened up google map and took us right to the spawn location we rushed to chase the pokemon before it expired the poke tweet in my city had been up and running for over a month but it has been down since october after a month of using the tweet i now have over a hundred snorlaxes and about sixty dragonites about a dozen of them are over cp unfortunately so do everyone who has been using the tweet
TheSilphRoad,removed,you mean dildo
TheSilphRoad,removed,for example this one
TheSilphRoad,removed,easy on the language killer
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah but still dial it down a notch haha i put sailors to shame at home but you never know whos reading this
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive hatched a few dratini and walked my ass off during halloween to get my lone dragonite lvl
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think its a grey area running bots is definitely against tos but youre not doing that you just joined a slack channel that gives you information so im going to talk about you using that information being cheating or not if a large group of people got themselves organized to go around the whole city and update the slack channel whenever they found something interesting they wouldnt be cheating theyre playing the game by the rules and theyre sharing information with other trainers which is the officially encouraged way to find rare pokemon the final result would be the same from your point of view if other trainers in your area told you where to find a snorlax would you be cheating to go get it so is getting information from others cheating if they cheated to find it i dont know nbsp now as to the spirit of the game i think its a personal decision some real world hunters like to keep things basic and enjoy the thrill of the hunt while others use high tech gear and advanced weapons to make it easier some in the first group might say that the latter are not real hunters and thats not what hunting is about i think thats what trackers are if you were a real life pokemon hunter you could chose to keep it basic and walk around hoping to run into something or set up advanced surveillance systems to alert you of pokemon locations and just go straight for them its up to you if you feel the latter is cheating ignoring tos for this part of the argument
TheSilphRoad,removed,you should see what we have here in sydney then sydneypogomapcom
TheSilphRoad,removed,this
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,my experience of the points load times yes it is taking forever i start the app and leave the phone in my pocket now to open a couple minutes later game freezes not happening so far gps drift still stopping gym fighting and for my luck it was on the last fight og a gym hp drop after dodge now its worse for me much worse i dodge the hp bar goes down goes up and then down again a lot pokestop sync now i am seeing pokestop glitching colors after spinning pokemon gender didnt see a single pikachuraichu after new year network changes ha now im getting network error spinning pokestops go brazil never saw the damn thing music app as an android player my problem regarding that is that if i spin stops while listening music at high volume i go deaf for a second so its worse in almost every aspect pretty much a regular niantic update
TheSilphRoad,removed,tutuapp went down for a little bit thats why number of spoofers disappeared for a little while too i assume pogo app got affected too by the forced update i just checked though and tutuapp is back up so expect the spoofers to return anytime now
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is really annoying its hard to see how the problem of having to wait a few seconds for almost blue to become full blue is more important than having a general sense of when a pokestop is ready for respinning
TheSilphRoad,removed,if and its a big if they did it because people complained then ill be pissed there are so many things that need fixingchanging that should take priority over the stupid color of pokestops so i doubt they did it because of pressure from their player base its not niantics mo to do that
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont trust anyone on the internet its way to easy to fake things nothing personal
TheSilphRoad,removed,i once bought a lucky egg and it didnt appear in my items i fired off an email explaining the mistake and surely enough niantic did fuck all about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,loading time is worse also it freezes when loaded hate this update but hope for something good in a few days
TheSilphRoad,removed,this shitpost is perfect for rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here in dc so very upset
TheSilphRoad,removed,im having trouble logging in by that i mean i havent been successful since i was seemingly booted off server my app had been open for a while and about minutes ago i wasnt loading anything i was attempting to attack a gym so i clicked on it and nothing loaded up so i restarted and upon reboot i wasnt able to get back in still cant get in bummer because i set aside some time this morning just to hit some gyms oh well just pokémon go things shrugs
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate it when my gps drifts to santa monica pier while im at work here in canada just so annoying too many dragonites everywhere gosh
TheSilphRoad,removed,lets be honest though niantic doesnt seem to truly care about spoofers anymore they are everywhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree so many people here myself included call out for better antispoofing control but it is crazy that because of their poor communication and occasional reports of the innocently banned we live in an augmented reality with so much fear and suspicion i trust big brother so long as he only punishes the cheaters
TheSilphRoad,removed,jesus christ everyone got so excited and hyped like instantly as if would come after server update
TheSilphRoad,removed,taste of their own medicine us loyal players have been experiencing issues since release
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy shit woo
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,seeing that most issues in the past have been minor text fixes they are probably just doing another one
TheSilphRoad,removed,poodlecorp
TheSilphRoad,removed,reading the comments on twitter are pure autism dead game then why are you on a pogo twitter release x yup they sure are listening to your request you special snowflake who still plays you must always ride the hype train and assume that for something to be popular it must have almost everyone everywhere playing
TheSilphRoad,removed,we may not know what database niantic uses but we might as well assume it is osm since that is the database we have access to for more upvotes just put niatic uses osm we can make spawnpoints
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok
TheSilphRoad,removed,okay
TheSilphRoad,removed,no shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,spoofer here not banned yet mwuahahahahahahhahah
TheSilphRoad,removed,no tldr downvote for you sir
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank your countrys idiotic populist parties for that
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,wrong
TheSilphRoad,removed,woah thats hella dope
TheSilphRoad,removed,get a life guy
TheSilphRoad,removed,if english isnt your first language sure ill let some things slide but if it is make an effort you idiot
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally this guy came up with new idea and he know what to do when u r ban or facing errors like our servers are humbled by your incredible response failed to get data from the server in pokemon go and etc check him and cheer him coz he save me
TheSilphRoad,removed,we must have very different definition of either the word balance or fine in that case p
TheSilphRoad,removed,do people really care about curses in this century my gosh
TheSilphRoad,removed,only problem is wild pidgeys have shit tier ivs ive caught well over checking ivs all the way and the highest ive found in the wild is hatched an from an egg but it ended up with aerial ace tho
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats some fucking rngeezus right there
TheSilphRoad,removed,this might be hit or miss mainly because there are so many ferries going in and out daily from that area with people on their cell phones since back in the day and also you might be too close to the bay bridge where there is quite a bit of cell traffic and spawns if you drive over it upside whether you use incense to get the rare spawn bonuses or not you are in a huuuge dratini natural spawn point so its not the worst place in the world to use it at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is so lame dude access codes that apparently never freaking work to get on your website that i want to visit super cool guys hope you get hacked
TheSilphRoad,removed,hm so that sucks my dragonite is only on the duel list shouldent have powered it up
TheSilphRoad,removed,only candies he says
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokevisionhk
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have submitted a tickets to niantic since the july still no reply about various things coins not in my accountno reply my account unlinked from my google mail replied twice twice automated response and lastly same issue as you im actually done with this game horrible customer service ive spend £ on this and refunded it all absolutely disappointed
TheSilphRoad,removed,one called pokemapper i believe
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol well until they last at least do you remember the good ol pokevisioncom days have you tried switching com to hk happy hunting
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup classic niantic ignore a problem then pretend it doesnt exist
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they did this to throw off dynamic mapscanners that wouldnt be too smart in my opinion wed just go back to beehive scanning using times the accounts were using now more server load again
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wish they did indeed send you wrong information for being a cheater imo just go out and be surprised ever thought about enjoying the game jeez endofsalt
TheSilphRoad,removed,wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong youre wrong youre wrong youre wrong youre right actually i just hope someone gets this reference
TheSilphRoad,removed,that was the last straw for me i was ecstatic to have a dratini nest within a min bike ride of my house losing that killed most of my enthusiasm for the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,brb relinking and rewriting out the literal of linksthreads to this information just for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,can i get banned hopefully play your game let them play theirs
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i was getting tired of using manual over and over i messed up was ties to my login to scan my pokemon pokeadvisor or whatever site i never got a banned email just a error when i log in i submitted a support ticket
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would at least evolve it if you get a hydro pump vaporeon it might be worth it plug it into the pokeassistant calculator to see how much stardust and candy it would cost to max out i would consider powering up a fire blast flareon too
TheSilphRoad,removed,because this app is threadbare as a game the only thing it has going for it is the emergent social experiences people are having as others stated niantics aggressive and misguided changes to the game have slowed the mid level casual interest daily users but not digging in to the game people have collected all the pokemon they can expect to without going to extreme measures there is now nothing to do with the pokemon they collected step collect pokemon step step a lot of people got past step
TheSilphRoad,removed,its nowhere near the core game in the core game you found pokemon alot more frequently and there were certain areas where you were practically guaranteed to run into that pokemon you wanted
TheSilphRoad,removed,lack of communication from niantic combined with poor features and constant crashing school starting winter months coming soon there will be even fewer players most games do have a drop from release kind fo liek a new movie however for pokemon it is really dire because there are people asking for their money back from apple store and google store
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont care that its your op you arrogant moron im having conversation with somebody else now accept that i dont want to talk to you you say your not arrogant but this proves otherwise dont want me to reply dont post on my thread
TheSilphRoad,removed,haha mines is at and my last have been aerodactyl and pinsir so shitty let me know if you get anything good this around
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not going to give niantic the benefit of the doubt right now the only thing theyve done right so far was the encrypted portion of the api they took down the mapsbots without harming regular users the various delays and banning behavior at best is annoying at worst its keeping real people from playing a gps system that excludes even moderately capable runners from hatching eggs is cruel is the tracker situation still incredibly frustrating hell yes it is the new tracker is only useful for places that have a significant number of stops and it isnt even available to all users they have not been a user friendly company thus far and i dont think their continued silence on matters important to the player base is helping bots will always work ive seen it in tons of games they build a better wall to protect their game and the bot makers make a bigger ladder or a tunneling machine botters have an uncanny ability to be extraordinarily resourceful they always find a way we shouldnt put regular people at risk of getting banned or having the game broken because of the inevitable programming arms race
TheSilphRoad,removed,a vileplume disappeared from my sightings while i was tracking it down i panicked and start running around and it popped out my pogom says it still has about seconds left thats why i persisted in running around this happened not long before i saw this post so i can confirm this is true
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats not new guys been around since the beginning
TheSilphRoad,removed,in other words it weakens of pokémon spawned going off the numbers i was just looking at in my pokédex and referenced in that other post
TheSilphRoad,removed,you miss the last line dipshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,new
TheSilphRoad,removed,but honestly i have seen a lot of people who refuse to admit that they were cheating despite incontrovertible evidence they certainly dont want to admit to their friends that they got busted fair and square because its very embarrassing to tell your friends that you werent an awesome player but just a dirty cheat all along this i see it too often my little brother tries this shit irl years and he still doesnt get it that everyone sees through his bs
TheSilphRoad,removed,new oh boy take a seat
TheSilphRoad,removed,i turned automatic time off and on again and the clock went back minutes so that might have actually been it technology hates me i swear ill try a new incense and share results
TheSilphRoad,removed,hah new where have you been
TheSilphRoad,removed,keeping an eye out for the code xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,code not working
TheSilphRoad,removed,invalid access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,not working
TheSilphRoad,removed,says invalid code
TheSilphRoad,removed,invalid code
TheSilphRoad,removed,not working
TheSilphRoad,removed,isnt working
TheSilphRoad,removed,invalid code
TheSilphRoad,removed,getting invalid access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,how is the code already invalid
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep invalid access code over here
TheSilphRoad,removed,code no workie
TheSilphRoad,removed,invalid acess code
TheSilphRoad,removed,invalid code
TheSilphRoad,removed,just says verify access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,invalid code
TheSilphRoad,removed,the site is saying the code is invalid what gives
TheSilphRoad,removed,invalid code
TheSilphRoad,removed,now working tnx
TheSilphRoad,removed,you guys need to have allowed reddit access within the last hour
TheSilphRoad,removed,yo what is this bs im actually on to use a code and its invalid they got used in like seconds
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh uh add a space after the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,working now
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks like the code is invalid
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think hype about humans redditlol
TheSilphRoad,removed,is this good to ban an is this good post
TheSilphRoad,removed,try httppokemonassistantcom
TheSilphRoad,removed,classic niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is why i stopped plauing i was proud of the territory i managed to create with others on my team weve held gyms for so long and when it goes down a few levels myself or someone else would pump it back up hasnt been the same since
TheSilphRoad,removed,its sad how much of a joke this game has become its almost as bad as no mans sky
TheSilphRoad,removed,no and you guys dont need to make posts everytime you go on a bad luck streak
TheSilphRoad,removed,already answered here but for me it was lapras caught in hours one day had or lapras flee on me a dragonite also spawned yesterday afternoon but i didnt go after him lapras was the priority and i already have dragonites at and spare candies i didnt need a probably low iv low level dragonite but i still gave a quick thought about having a chance to fight my first wild dragonite all mines were evolved from dratini
TheSilphRoad,removed,over hours i wished i used a scanner
TheSilphRoad,removed,same thing here there is a spawn point across the street from my house that reliably produced a couple of pokemon per hour so i used to keep the app open to see if anything good spawned there so id walk over to catch it now all i see is pokestops half a mile away they completely got rid of sightings if there is even one pokestop within a mile of you wtf niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,es they only care about security but each version has more bugs and uses more ram horror pogo connection stil not fixed on my hone connects of
TheSilphRoad,removed,it would literally take seconds to verify this the answer is no
TheSilphRoad,removed,comment
TheSilphRoad,removed,quit while youre behind
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you played when the original tracking was working youd understand why remove it when they can fix it
TheSilphRoad,removed,but apparently the reason why hasnt been said before huh
TheSilphRoad,removed,instinct sux
TheSilphRoad,removed,for how much let it go if it was only a few bucks and you are still spending hours on their game
TheSilphRoad,removed,psa clicking the pokeball icon in your list of apps will open the pokémon go game s
TheSilphRoad,removed,which scanner
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems like were done here
TheSilphRoad,removed,לא מופיע אצלי
TheSilphRoad,removed,like no one ever was to catch them is my real test
TheSilphRoad,removed,okie dokie if you say so misleading title imo
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait til dragonites start spawing in the gaza strip looks like another excuse for some settlers to warm up their bulldozers and firearms
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude dont make excuses in an attempt to make yourself feel better you either want to level fast or you dont or youre just bad at it its fine but quit talking like people who grind dont have responsibilities or jobs or garbage like that we just know how to manage our time to get what we want
TheSilphRoad,removed,get an actual hobby
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah yeah a kid shouldve thought about the fact you had big dreams of becoming a pokemon master before conceiving crotchspawn thats what you get man s i work anywhere from hours a week too though i think a kid is realistically the only real barrier here to making time to grind if i know i cant squeeze my hrs a day in during the day i just get up early and do it super early morning after gyms i think unless someones working literally every minute theyre awake they can get to in a pretty efficient time frame if they want to
TheSilphRoad,removed,someones a real douche canoe
TheSilphRoad,removed,oruse pokemesh and have notifications set if one of them spawn ive got snorlax again yesterday lapras the day before
TheSilphRoad,removed,so it looks like another scam from niantic dont buy it people
TheSilphRoad,removed,i live in a town of people i try to keep a mon in a gym thats about a minute walk down a nature trail it usually stays about a day once it lasted days i recently scanned wwwpokemogomapinfo for similar gyms near me on trails out of the way places im going on a hike in a bit to try out some i found in the middle of my town gyms usually turn over in a couple hours but sometimes last until the next day
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean they cant even make tracking happen i wouldnt doubt if ditto was too difficult
TheSilphRoad,removed,i honestly wish u nothing but painful death
TheSilphRoad,removed,gg
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemongomap
TheSilphRoad,removed,palestinians join mystic israelis join valor a whole new way to fight
TheSilphRoad,removed,uh yeah its am here i walk around the historical section of town where theres stops i also hit the nearby lake with stops and gyms i average coins a day when i can manage to get out i also reported gps spoofers because i was walking around saw a gym i owned being fought walked over saw nobody there waited until it went down and reported the user who took it then took my gym back
TheSilphRoad,removed,pogotoolkitcom is more handy
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is one of the reasons why good phones cost that much better performance and heat management cost a lot so cheaper phones skip on this parts
TheSilphRoad,removed,just keep patting yourself on the back and telling everyone how much greater they and by extension you for being here are fan the rivalry that doesnt exist outside of this sub feel better about yourself for being better and letting the quire know it good job on being so much better more humble too i think
TheSilphRoad,removed,commence circlejerk
TheSilphRoad,removed,hasnt it already been confirmed that nicegreatexcellent bonuses are only for xp i believe the catch rate changes as the circle gets smaller meaning that you dont actually have to land a ball within the smaller circle
TheSilphRoad,removed,my heart says that i need to pick my bulbastarter for this role it seems the only fitting answer picked him involuntarily in the beginning of the game but ive grown incredibly fond of him maybe i just let him tag along till he is a maxed venusaur it seems like such an epic struggle when i am level in two years he will be kicking everyones ass
TheSilphRoad,removed,the google spreadsheet found here showed my vapo as another vapo made from eevee in the range wut then pokeassistantcom confirmed what spreadsheet showed this calculator showed the as and the latter as so which one is correct
TheSilphRoad,removed,i signed into the site through reddit why the hell do i need an access code on top of signing in how do i get one
TheSilphRoad,removed,your list is a failure it is trying to force me to click on type never seen in my area but i have literally seen everything on the list you also failed to put east coast you dont count virginia north carolina florida and such as the south or the north east you also for got to put the south west regions
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats the problem with so many of these circulating some of them are bound to be incorrect i wish people werent flooding the sub with iv posts as it is i just use poke assistant since thats what niantic gave to beta testers
TheSilphRoad,removed,once the step counter is reactivated i hope this fades away i love hunting for pokemon i thoroughly enjoyed it when the game first landed however i dont like seeing a desirable pokemon at the top of my nearby and not finding them for as i walk in every which direction like a moron wasting my time and causing much frustration as a result of the current state of the tracker if the step system worked id see this as absolutely unacceptable and extremely counterintuitive to the purpose and great qualities of this game my personal moral rule until the tracker is fixed use it and refresh only once if i have a pokemon on the top on my nearby that id like to find why flop over when ive been looking for a pokemon for so long but otherwise cant even find as a result of the games current state
TheSilphRoad,removed,sick down votes
TheSilphRoad,removed,flair up new here and looking forward to being a part
TheSilphRoad,removed,id love it if the next most common list was in alphabetical order
TheSilphRoad,removed,same thing happened to me oh well ill just assume we had the best ones and some tryhard had to report us so they could get the edge id like to think thats how it went down
TheSilphRoad,removed,welcome to the new silph road now with nore rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,okay and gyms get prestige when something is added to it the gym probably was maxed out and had things added to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is the name of this gym scanner
TheSilphRoad,removed,no but they do beta test with the intention of having the game played on cell phones using cell phones
TheSilphRoad,removed,i spend euros on it that i earned with google rewards to support niantic but since the lack of anticheating measures i decided i wont spend another euro cent on it in contrary to ingress nia isnt doing anything with reports of local spoofers and all those sad people that have double accounts to kick teammates out of level gyms while especially the last is really easy to see and automate for nia
TheSilphRoad,removed,because there are other games for that this is not a sit on your ass turned based game and the gym battles are ok easy fast battles so you dont sit for hours in one spot
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey whats a gym tracker app
TheSilphRoad,removed,youve put the same post up twice but with different wording in mins udronpes please remove
TheSilphRoad,removed,what do you mean i linked the basis as well as commented how it closely aligns with the information i know first hand and information i got from my people i know personally who also have many submissions waiting to be reviewed i probably have nearly waiting and thats not an uncommon number to be around
TheSilphRoad,removed,or you could move on with your life so tired of seeing these damn crybaby posts no matter what in life people will always cheat get over it
TheSilphRoad,removed,then you should have point all of this out in your original post ill wait and see if im wrong i will apologise until then jury is out for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,just move your finger farther
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed im only level with a single dragonite and only a couple of vaporeons and one snorlax and stardust as i have not caughthatched a top attackerdefender with decent moveset and iv so far yet it really does not make a difference to me whether i take down a level gym with vaporeons and rhydons or dragonites and snorlaxes to get my coins a day the latter takes a little longer but this is not much of a valid reason to avoid high cp gyms i live in a highturnover area uni campus which means that if a gym is level or below it is likely to change teams within minutes i sometimes manage to hold and very rarely gyms at the same time but even a level gym rarely lasts for more than a day with individuals training it up in the early mornings or late evenings and passing students just putting their pokemons in while my environment is far from being average i see similar situations in city centres around me if you are lucky and live in a city with vast suburbs such as berlin the above strategy can work for densely populated urban areas i doubt it is of much help
TheSilphRoad,removed,how many goddamn times are you planning on posting this
TheSilphRoad,removed,learn what psa means and when to use it
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually these fucking birds are doing some good damage as with wing attack and hurricane
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont be silly that would mean the all is tailored for everyone and that would somehow be worse than it only being tailored for those it is now progress is bad and everything is perfect the way it is you entitled child s
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have an unlimited bus train and subway card i guess ill be going downtown more often
TheSilphRoad,removed,you didnt check the moves of each arbok people are posting the most ridiculous things trying to find ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the worst implementation of this concept ever
TheSilphRoad,removed,or you can buy coins and phone apple saying it glitched i got refunded and have poke coins too spend
TheSilphRoad,removed,waiting for todays code
TheSilphRoad,removed,where are the codes posted it is edt right now dont see anything on the site
TheSilphRoad,removed,codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,when do the codes come out today
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy shit central park is now a electabuzz fest
TheSilphRoad,removed,why hasnt the codes dropped yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not seeing the new code for today did they put it out
TheSilphRoad,removed,have you actually inspected the protobufs that the game provides latlong is stored with each encounter which is sent only for pokémon that are in the catchable range for some reason while all the nearby encounters the ones in the list return a broken metre distance value
TheSilphRoad,removed,but youre more likely to have pidgeys near your max cp without using any stardust since youre going to find many many more of them
TheSilphRoad,removed,i for the life of me cannot get the requirements to run off of the easy setupstartbat tried just running the requirements themselves and it errors out as well there are two that fail each time tried running as admin still no change ran a repair on my python installation no change i have two older versions of the pokemap running smoothly on my machine i was using to help my nephew and his friends but wanted to give this one a try any help would be appreciated cusersmedesktoppokemongomapdeveloppip install r requirementstxt requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in cpy from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in cpyth from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in c from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in c from r requirementstxt line collecting from r requirementstxt line using cached requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in cpytho from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in cpy from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in cp from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in cpy from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in c from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in c from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in c from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in c from r requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in from r requirementstxt line collecting from r requirementstxt line using cached requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in c from r requirementstxt line collecting from r requirementstxt line using cached collecting from r requirementstxt line using cached requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade setuptools in cpytho from requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade future in libsitepackages from requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade in from requirementstxt line requirement already satisfied use upgrade to upgrade six in sitepackages from requirementstxt line collecting pyproj from requirementstxt line using cached complete output from command python setuppy egginfo using bundled traceback most recent call last file string line in module file line in module objects cccompile file line in compile selfinitialize file line in initialize vcenv queryvcvarsallversion platspec file line in msvc return environmentinfoarch verreturnenv file line in ret urnenv the system cannot find the file specified command python setuppy egginfo failed with error code in cusersmeapp cusersmedesktoppokemongomapdeveloppause press any key to continue
TheSilphRoad,removed,today is july edt ive seen no new codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,where is cambridge common
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not even really trying to be superior but as the person below me said its not complicated math if somebody had a gun to your head you could probably figure this out on your own i believe in you
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have done this on purpose on occations both times i knew i was exp left to level up so i rerolled the pokemon by evolving some pidgeys first time was lvl i rerolled a golem i found to a second time was at level and was just a low eevee that i rerolled to a both times it was ofcourse just luck that made them roll higher could just as well have been lower the point is you get a reroll the small things
TheSilphRoad,removed,well theres the species specific one but that isnt really relevant in any scenario but directly deriving cp from base stats or vice versa
TheSilphRoad,removed,i doubt they can ban all of them yes they can ban the most egregious cases such as people teleporting all around the place miles at a time or people teleporting between cities every few hours san francisco to ny in hours uhh no itll be as simple as calculate speed of player between points if it ever exceeds a certain amount repeatedly then ban you have to be careful though what about people that fly for work for example a few years back i did this a few times wake up in home city city a drive to airport and fly to transport hub in city b take second flight to city c pick up rental car drive to conference center do some setup of technical equipment drive back to airport take flight back to transport hub city b take another flight back home city a in one day i was at three different cities in two of them i was driving all over the place to get things done if i did that today i could easily just have my phone open most of the time catching pokemon and hitting pokestops all over the country in day
TheSilphRoad,removed,my ios version
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you want to team up i just made an ios version
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont have a home pc this game kicks ass so much for me because it works for my poor ass no computer no tv no internet i have a phone and i can use my work pc for some stuff
TheSilphRoad,removed,not really i hunt dratini there and ive done just fine for myself on foot
TheSilphRoad,removed,where did i ever say anything about pokeballs catching pokemon simply becomes a pain in the ass once youre level when me and my level friend walk around together she gets every pidgey and zubat on the first try while im stuck there getting great or excellent throws and theyre still breaking out thats why it helps to have free xp later on you can quickly push through levels that would otherwise be far more time consuming
TheSilphRoad,removed,access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,wtf is it
TheSilphRoad,removed,because youre a failure
TheSilphRoad,removed,oops
TheSilphRoad,removed,oops the silph road has encountered an issue feel free to reach out on discord or via reddit pm to udronpes well be back soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,i keep getting an oops screen after authenticating my reddit account
TheSilphRoad,removed,didnt get in before the reddit hug of death feelsbad
TheSilphRoad,removed,encountering issues probably due to amount of traffic
TheSilphRoad,removed,tried to access with the code but only got an oops the silph road has encountered an issue
TheSilphRoad,removed,as of pm est httpsthesilphroadcomresearch is down error
TheSilphRoad,removed,jeez this is like trying to buy a bag of crap during a wootoff
TheSilphRoad,removed,i got an opps the silph road has encountered an issue what do i do
TheSilphRoad,removed,funny thing i got to the site without needing to type the code even got to submit a nest location lets hope im still in when the code is all gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool i got past the the code stage stuck on screen with user and age done wont work if i leave and come back in an hour will i still be good or will the code have timed out
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi guys the code is not working oops the silph road has encountered an issue feel free to reach out on discord or via reddit pm to udronpes well be back soon that appears when i enter the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,so it let me make an account but never asked for a code
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi guys the code is not working oops the silph road has encountered an issue feel free to reach out on discord or via reddit pm to udronpes well be back soon that appears when i enter the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,website died
TheSilphRoad,removed,doesnt work man it says oops has encountered an issue pls contact udronpes help
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems to have been taken down does anyone have an apk mirror
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was thinking something along those lines as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,are the access codes all distributed im getting invalid access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,weedle code not working for anyone else
TheSilphRoad,removed,so if it says invalid code does that mean you have reached your limit today
TheSilphRoad,removed,how is this different than pokenotify
TheSilphRoad,removed,well for your information i was simply quoting udronpes but maybe his logic is poor as well what does he know its his sub s
TheSilphRoad,removed,trainer tips is just rehashing similar topics to what he already talked about i stopped watching him
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you have ios go radar works great at the pier i went last night and caught a handful of dratininairnite
TheSilphRoad,removed,i made a new account for a new challenge trying to level up without spinning pokestops or spending money using only the level reward balls hatching and karpinggymming
TheSilphRoad,removed,i guess that this is the end now you because you cant use pogo in a car anymore good job niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel your pain niantic are harming the community and the user base it has already acquired with this randomisation horse st
TheSilphRoad,removed,that would require niantic to actually care about its user base which it clearly does not
TheSilphRoad,removed,youd think theyd add more then take away im seriously pissed right now rip front yard spawn you were a great way to distract myself through my depression and get through each hour hello seasonal depression
TheSilphRoad,removed,at this point it seems they are trying to cut down on servers needed to run the game and decreasing everything spawns revives from pokestops players
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was looking at go radar and it seems like a grow lithe nest changed into a drowzee nest
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been watching for an hour from home and my spawn is gone too i know the plural of anecdotes isnt data but it really seems like there are a lot more reports of lost spawns than gained ones and of course its now next to impossible to quantify it without scanners im getting beyond frustrated with this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just lost spawn points i want to quit this game so badly now its becoming almost impossible to defend it after the not being able to hatch while joggingbiking scanner drama ad mph speed limit on transport now
TheSilphRoad,removed,im rural as well but two updates ago they finally put two spawns on my road i was so happy not to have to go miles to find a spawn now theyre gone i dont even have any feelings left
TheSilphRoad,removed,i had and sometimes a lucky second one what the hell they were pidgeys but ill take anything cmon niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah nests used to get me out of the house that and actually having a shot at finding something rare now i just stay at home and dont even open the app just catch weedles and pidgeys with the plus only even grinding has lost its shine now im level ive got about two lucky eggs worth of pokemon to evolve which will take me well past level and i havent had the motivation to do it in over a week im also pretty much out of pokeballs and cant get motivated to go collect more the plus being ineffective at this task for me doesnt help i dont want to be done with the game but their vision of what it should be is obviously so different to the game ive been playing and loving so far
TheSilphRoad,removed,they keep on changing stuff about mon location but they wont implement a working tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe they removed the spawnpoints which have been accidently added due to activity of hacker scan maps without them working right now they probably were able to get more reliable seeds for the spawnpoint distribution
TheSilphRoad,removed,spawn times have changed so have spawn types have pikachu and tangela spawning out of nowhere on the same exact spot where a spawn point was never seen points home have disappeared but new ones appeared joy not
TheSilphRoad,removed,im gonna entitle this change the first great mass extinction i currently have a single weedle on the nearby screen
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is niantics tactic they want people to travel and that means they want rural players to travel to the cities or quit
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you feel like they just wanted to force rurals to have to pay to play im starting to
TheSilphRoad,removed,so they dont want us to have scanners or work as a community what a terrible game creator
TheSilphRoad,removed,daaang random spawns everywhere and of course one of my best spawn points streak spawns between on one road didnt spawn when i was going home at the exact hour there were gastlys sometimes rhyhorns meowths venonats rarest spawns in my town so far my home spawns seem normal but at this rate i will be happy if my town will keep any spawn points till winter seriously wtf niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,more like to stop players wasting time with this unfinished beta whatever im pissed xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,came here to confirm what i have seen all morning the spawn i could reach from the desk of my office is gone i also cant no longer play while using public transportation the game is really trying to kick me out
TheSilphRoad,removed,to add to the unhappiness tally i used to be able to see two spawn points from my house with one of them basically inaccessible being down the cliff and then last month when things shifted i was able to see three and while not as convenient as my friends who could catch all kinds of things without leaving their house still seemed awesome now i am down to zero ive been patient with other inexplicable changes to the game but come on niantic i can only hope this is just an unfortunate hiccup and things will improve again soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know how to feel about this trend i mean in the real pokemon world pokemon wouldnt spend at the exact same spot over and over clearly niantic is aiming for more of a realistic real world type of game and less of typical game experience nick trainertips was talking about this recently what i took from his commentary on it kind of echos my feelings that its very ambitious of niantic and also makes things more intetesting but interesting doesnt always equal fun games are supposed to be fun its an absolute requirement if they arent then people wont play them i think this kind of falls into the category of interesting but not so much fun more like real life and less like a game but less reliable for those of us that are dedicated im really trying to embrace the stay positive message of this sub its a big part of what makes tsr my go to place for pogo but again just as nick was saying niantic can make the game they game they want they clearly have a vision and obviously intend on seeing that vision through or you can make the game that the community wants to play people are going to play one im in it for the long haul but i do really wish things felt different it just feels like things are steering further away from the game that myself and many others want to play maybe at a certain point thus will change or maybe their vision will finally start to come together and that will coincide with the game we all want to play the past few months tell me thats a pipe dream i sure hope im wrong i only spent hour at the local nest today it started as nest spawn points at launch at the last migration it dropped to and damn it today i only got granted that was only hour maybe something else spawned from the second nest spawn point i can say with certainty that this can happen but its rare but my guess is that now my local near dropped to a single spawn point thats not a nest thats a semi reliable spawn point it was always slow but reliable spawn per hour is a joke the only other nest has seemingly vanished it started as spawn points then then it vanished altogether i live in a town of over people around gyms in and around town maybe total gyms are on the county within minutes drive from town thats a pretty good amount and although the pokestop distribution isnt the best theres only one restock loop worth using stops in a loop you can drive in mins or walk in this is downtown and spawns are ample just not good stuff a few other spots that are semi productive to restock but nothing spawns in those areas at all aside from this so called nest lol i mean really do we need to shuffle spawn points like this so often how about move the spawn points that are utilized very rarely say of the pokemon spawned at a point get caught then move it and beyond that just add more everyone wants more spawn points at work at home in town in parks in nests i dunno i guess im just rambling i shouldnt complain i have more spawns at my house and in my hood than most people do atleast for now but whos to say they just havent tolled out the change to my area and half of them vanish today sigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,lures work o different mechanics than incense they have a prepared list for each pokestop that changes based on the number of players near it incense would depend if there where spawn points within about distance i know this from experimenting in godhula minnesota no native spawns for miles incense gives randoms the one and only pokestop gives the common pokémon only that was with me being the only player there
TheSilphRoad,removed,fucking thank you really frustrating to see every post in this sub and have to do the significance yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is with all the research publications basically saying our scientific studies conclude that water is in fact wet
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only thing i can think of is making a account on a different team and if i get sniped on the level up ill just knock it back down and do it all over again well thats definitely a bad idea and against the rules also thats not even the smart way to do it it would be wiser to pick the same team and then train it up with your alternate account and snipe the gym from yourself with your main account that way you can have the gym selected and ready to put in a pokemon on one device the very instant you defeat the last necessary pokemon on the other device granted this is not recommended as it is against their official rules
TheSilphRoad,removed,o k
TheSilphRoad,removed,they really just want people to aimlessly walk about and stumble on pokemon im starting to think that there is a big gulf between how they want the game played and how the majority of players want it to be
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think the lengths people go on this board to over analyze the mundane and pointless aspects of a very playskool level game are astounding this isnt starcraft
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know if this helps but i havent seen any rares in weeks ive pretty much stopped playing because its weedlespidgey world out there its just getting depressing to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,rares have dried up too any joy i had left in this game is gone
TheSilphRoad,removed,sucks to be you
TheSilphRoad,removed,my biggest irk about this game right now is that it discourages exploration i can walk around my hometown and catch everything since i know all the spawn times and locations without a decent tracker i dont want to wander around a new town and not find anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,next thing were gonna be investigating if they are not planning a and enslaving all smartphone users give those guys a break
TheSilphRoad,removed,a vast majority of my eevees evolve into vaporeons i have several with near perfect ivs and are over im team valor and almost level if that matters
TheSilphRoad,removed,the point of a game is to engage the players in a way that allows them to enjoy themselves not to constantly butt into their experience and tell them how they are allowed to enjoy themselves
TheSilphRoad,removed,come on i am not in favor of people making mean comments to you but lets not complain about chronic diseases to elicit sympathy on a freaking pokémon sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a disappointment lost the only two spawn points i can use during the week
TheSilphRoad,removed,they are still not going to comment on the speed lock what a shit company
TheSilphRoad,removed,dicks out for house spawns
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe youve noticed there is a major difference in dodgeability between solar beam and seed bomb if not no problem one day you will also have that much experience in gym fights
TheSilphRoad,removed,im just raping refresh button on niantic page d im just curious if buddy will be only candy maker or something more
TheSilphRoad,removed,this has been my exact same experience with catch attempts from incense spawns at high speeds
TheSilphRoad,removed,the glory of jailbreaking has graced me once again
TheSilphRoad,removed,that moment when you realize you need to move to canada and it isnt entirely due to trump
TheSilphRoad,removed,just throw on airplane mode on ios
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly people keep making a big deal about it but its not even a problem and people never discuss the downsides where it would have a cascade effect of unintended consequences throughout the game to change it wait its niantic theyll probably radically change it and laugh at us
TheSilphRoad,removed,hit level stop giving a fuck and levelled up my mons
TheSilphRoad,removed,and thank you for not turning rthesilphroad into rpokemongo with contentless posts oh wait
TheSilphRoad,removed,level hatched ive found certain pokemon to be stupidly common in eggs for a period of time for a week or so it was ekans i was just immediately tossing them to the glue factory right now its ponyta its never got to that point with porygon but its pretty common i have of them and tons of candy that im saving for porygon never seen one in the wild though
TheSilphRoad,removed,excuse me did you just assume omastars gender
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is why i prefer rthesilphroad over rpokemongo everything useful is posted here first before being reposted over at rpokemongo the community over there is also horrible comment or post something that a casual cant comprehend and you get downvoted into oblivion
TheSilphRoad,removed,ingame sexual network how many stories in a year or two will we see of people getting together because they chased the same snorlax in central park
TheSilphRoad,removed,all the resources for the game here are very interesting however the main reason i come to silphroad the nests and sightings are kinda useless there are lots in my city but none of them work other services like pokeradar were much better but now they are broken aswell anyone got an idea for an alternative
TheSilphRoad,removed,meanwhile rpokemongo still hates niantic for removing tracking and making a game with any depth to retain the millions of people who were playing on launch i think theyve been doing a fantastic job as a small team for the months that game has been out
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup the grinding aspect and the fact that multiplayer is almost nonexistant make this game fade out quite fast if it werent for the nerdish picking apart of every aspect of the game id quit very quickly
TheSilphRoad,removed,she probably can get pregnant just by being touched after you gave yourself a what are the odds about in times in times in so that would be one in
TheSilphRoad,removed,defending pokemon have a twosecond delay before each attack essentially adding to all of their attack times this makes attacks that already have long striketimes proportionally more favorable so the dps of dragon claw on defense is the dps of dragon pulse on defense is
TheSilphRoad,removed,dear reddit im confused i named my pokémon han and attacked a gym i couldnt tell from the angle who shot first
TheSilphRoad,removed,i poked ur mom last night
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah pretending the game is complex sure makes it feel like a real game to me too
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate those shitty jynxs and elctabuzzes
TheSilphRoad,removed,im at days and going downnnnnn
TheSilphRoad,removed,so fairly new and not a piece of shit that youd almost expect to not work
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow i guess youve never heard the phrase friendly competition huh if your objective is to remove all fun and ruin the game for the other two teams then i hope everyone reports you too
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know what you talk about op it happened to me and my group and it was a damn chore to train against that gym even worse ive seen once from team blue where a group would train one of the guys would immediately add his monster in the gym and leave with a bye you can train the gym further on if you want to it was even worse than staying hidden and sniping it was a frontal fuck you to everbody else
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel the iv checking in game will be vague unfortunate and unreasonable much like my existence
TheSilphRoad,removed,how about evaluation of our pokemons movesets you know because movesets are actually important unlike ivs in this game or even better a way of rerolling movesets
TheSilphRoad,removed,im thinking they just were autocorrected from bug to bot xd damn you macos
TheSilphRoad,removed,it seems to be pretty crap
TheSilphRoad,removed,all this is going to do is make more people aware of ivs leading to more people using apps to check their ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for the info not in any hurry now to get the new update
TheSilphRoad,removed,they wasted their time on that crap that is so stupid im tilted
TheSilphRoad,removed,guys if you really want your pokemon appraised by its iv and movesets upload screenshots of your pokemon to httpratemypokemoncom it will give you attacker and defender rating a perfect dragonite have an attacker rating and a perfect snorlax have a defender rating of see examples of perfect pokemons ratings
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh thank god we have iv checks instead that will make catching pokemon sooooo much better
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre right those vague ivs are really going to take away any need for my party non tos breaking calculator
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is what we waited for and what theyve been putting two weeks of work into what a waste seriously still no update to the difficulty in actually catching something still no update to the hatching speed and inaccuracy still no update to tracking still no update to gyms or battling
TheSilphRoad,removed,play this game less and less daily with their commitment to lack of building and creating a quailty pokemon product i will keep on risking my account checking ivs the painless way this update shows this game will never cater to competitive pokemon players maybe nintendo doesnt want a real mobile pokemon experience either way i know not to spend another cent on the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,welp i had a dream that niantic would fix their game before the hype train left the station you saw million daily active users leave in the last days hold on to your buts for the next niantic more like tiatinic men and women for yourselves
TheSilphRoad,removed,that sounds very disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,so niantic is botting now wtf
TheSilphRoad,removed,they just need to put the grass animation back in to mark the location of the pokemon in the sightings list and bam no need for any party mappers
TheSilphRoad,removed,more downvoted comments on this thread than upvoted talk about toxic
TheSilphRoad,removed,the appraisal thing is just silly i guess it appeals to the less extreme players who arent aiming for nearperfect ivs and religiously checking the iv rater but why is it so dang hard to just give us atk and def with numbers you can keep the cp just tell me the actual numbers for attack and defense—it seems so trivial
TheSilphRoad,removed,im guessing it will be just as effective and impactful as those minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,the cancerc in this thread is worse than in pokemongo wtf is happening to thesilphroad
TheSilphRoad,removed,i didnt have much expectations so i am not really disappointed just a bit sad i was right and they didnt do anything major
TheSilphRoad,removed,what isnt trivial is how much slower this process is compared to just scanning across numbers on pgnexus or some similar sie
TheSilphRoad,removed,getting cryptic phrases to give vuage indications iv is still pretty painful cant they just give us the stats i also see minor bot fixes in the list there
TheSilphRoad,removed,so now we cant track anything at all yay for randomness s
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep it looks like all trackers are now gone nothing works at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont know why they just tell u exactly what they are on the info screen as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,working for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,i havent had the update yet but go radar is still working and i assume poke assistant will still work these are the two tools oil use most people at central park use go radar works well there will these stop working i though go radar connected players via their phones and sightings can someone explain cheers
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemongomaps still working
TheSilphRoad,removed,just show the ivs i dont want the trainer to explain it like im an idiot just show me the numbers its ridiculous mass transferring and being able to skip the cinematic sequence of evolutions pvp whats the point of having an arsenal of awesome pokemon if we cant battle them not battling some gym defending ai actual pvp
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokealert is still working
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,until they figure out a way around it againthis isnt the last we seen of trackers maybe be down for a few days but someone will crack the api again
TheSilphRoad,removed,attack defence stamina is overwhelming thought it was a pretty basic measurement lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,top tier blanche tier spark tier candela tier thats what i think see ya
TheSilphRoad,removed,this was done and beaten in runescape years ago and could easily be done here httpwwwkaitniekscomsleepwalkerhistory you get captchas solved if you have points you earn points by solving captchas for other people the program takes a picture of the captcha and sends it to people it sends the reply to the game if you solve it you earn point since theres so many people using it you easily gain points and since the game doesnt really bug you with many captchas points could easily run a bot for a day mappers could present users the captcha if the userbase is big enough botters will have to solve a few every now and then when at the pc to build up points or you could send push notifications to a phone and solve it directly there im more worried about
TheSilphRoad,removed,impossible doesnt mean what you think it means
TheSilphRoad,removed,did you update your pokemon go app yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,whoever maintains this site literally took the exact words from my comments in the update threads that explain what each sentence from the appraisal means and threw them onto this site guess some of us are leaders and some of us are followers
TheSilphRoad,removed,vac does it pretty well
TheSilphRoad,removed,fast pokemap still works for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,this kind of bugs meniantic sees the interest the community has with iv values listens and implements a feature that is nowhere near as useful as the hundreds of iv calculators made by other players i wish the information you got was detailed in its current form its just a step up from not knowing the iv at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,when your spawn points are apart sightings do jack all
TheSilphRoad,removed,it will be about or so not sure what the other poster did but at level with those ivs its definitely close to
TheSilphRoad,removed,i find this feature to be rather useless i need the actual numbers niantic means nothing is it is a or only two of those rating i am willing to keep by the way not enough information and that which is given is more oblique nonsense arrgh super frustrating
TheSilphRoad,removed,not good enough i need to know if its son
TheSilphRoad,removed,as posted in every sub ever 👍🏻
TheSilphRoad,removed,fastpokemap still seems to be up though
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly no i did not i went through meticulous trial and error with known pokemon of my own to determine the ranges best i could the factor of time consumption was the reason i only listed the ranges i thought people would care most about regardless the reply was more of a fun stab and im wholeheartedly down with the community sharing information
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant go back to randomly wandering around i dont have time to dedicate an entire day to wandering around blindly and calling it hunting
TheSilphRoad,removed,where credit where credit is due man
TheSilphRoad,removed,nbspnbspnbspnbspif theyre going this far why cant this just give us the numbers even if they bury it under settings and make it something you have to actually turn on so more casual players arent intimidated and dont have to ever see it the clearly know we want this why do they have to play this stupid you think you want it but you dont why dont we give you this instead game that never works
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is kinda a dick move dont you think i just happened to be browsing and saw todays time was minutes away so i read the threads and check the auth screen and read the twitter and still nothing kinda lame i wonder if the msg shortly is going to say all of todays codes are gone come back wed
TheSilphRoad,removed,watch out everyone we have one of those guys over here
TheSilphRoad,removed,come on its minutes now
TheSilphRoad,removed,they must have meant est
TheSilphRoad,removed,i guess we can confirm the code release isnt an automated system
TheSilphRoad,removed,lets clarify something your complaint is solely that they used the phrasing at least one stat with a bonus iv value of thats it however the way youve phrased things as if you are the leader and gamepress is the follower suggesting that gamepress is taking each sentence and throwing it onto the site like you did all of this yourself and gamepress just ripped it and posted it for personal glory like really what happened is you did all the work which is just false thats what im taking issue with you getting voted to the top here discrediting the work of the person who put this together all night staying up late after he just helped deal with the bubblestrat aftermath super late the night before all for essentially nothing now because of your post some people think gamepress is just a bunch of thieving copycats and no doubt youve harmed the reputation of a site that is doing more to update this community with accurate reliable selfresearched information than any other
TheSilphRoad,removed,where is the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,can be doesnt equal can be costeffectively done across all mobile platforms especially in an alreadybroken system like this cluster
TheSilphRoad,removed,can the mods at least give us an update as to what is happening
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wonder if they forgot about the release time
TheSilphRoad,removed,guys if you made me leave late from work just so i cant get a code id be furious
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh comon
TheSilphRoad,removed,i came back at am edt and nothing seems to be happening
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wonder if they posted it to twitter
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been already minutes
TheSilphRoad,removed,fun is subjective
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love you guys thanks for not wasting my minutes
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres so many things chiming my thought from earlier niantic is making it harder and harder for people to operate on a large scale i can see the major providers die soon and then a bunch of smaller communities will figure out how to collaboratively fund small clicks for their own groups if we dont come up with a way to make the process decentralized and accessible for all it will very soon become cost prohibitive to run any all together interesting times to be a dev
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic couldnt handle the server load of calculating and steps for pokemon i highly doubt they can handle pattern checking for each individual user for data collected from phones
TheSilphRoad,removed,dat bias
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this is super vague and less than useful if you catch a lot of pokemon thanks for nothing niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i still have yet to have a tracker that works how many update are they just going to leave my area behind
TheSilphRoad,removed,no you just really want to change teams to the point of where youll argue its fair to everyone to push your personal needs
TheSilphRoad,removed,well im guessing casuals might out number hardcore iv stat and tracking calculating and move equating players but thats just my guess and like i said numbers may come but they may not its not worth complaining about if getting the numbers is pretty easy for hardcore players like yourself as casual players probably wont care about the difference between and
TheSilphRoad,removed,he probably was a cheater and kotaku is a garbage website on the level of gawker
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is an xposed module for rooted android devices that lets you know the exact catch rate of a pokemon as soon as the encounter starts only basic catch rate with each ball doesnt take into account your berry usage or throwing techniques might be useful for you to correlate your data with real packets from the server yes it breaks the tos but it is undetectable as it doesnt send back any modified packets
TheSilphRoad,removed,the original tracker itself doesnt cause instability the servers still sucked shit for a long time during the forced stage it was just one thing they could do to help ease the huge initial spike that most big online releases have theyve got it under control now we could have the feature back also can i get a source on this they said three steps lead to server instability
TheSilphRoad,removed,does your sisters clitoris taste like chocolate
TheSilphRoad,removed,id like some stats on how many other charity events have been ruined by random changes from niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,congrats on the catch
TheSilphRoad,removed,but they let you easily get rid of the other of pokemon leaving you with a whole lot less to check
TheSilphRoad,removed,please they have been making these games for twenty years iv calculators have been around for over a decade they werent suprised that people wanted to know look how many people here didnt know what an iv rating was until coming to this thread now those people and more are excited to get that new update and play some more
TheSilphRoad,removed,as much as we would all love that it doesnt coincide with how pokemon handles their own games they probably want to maintain the spirit of the mainline series
TheSilphRoad,removed,a heck of a lot less stupid noise than there is in rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,make type advantage actually useful with and damage multipliers let us spam heal a pokemon and not have to wait seconds between each potion used trying to heal tanks with potions is a pain in the ass right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was able to do it with a magnemite and a horsea trying to figure out how i can prove it still
TheSilphRoad,removed,same but i throw exclusively that way now used to use my index but got tired of having to hold the phone with hands to pitch never going back to index i love thumb pitching
TheSilphRoad,removed,why is everyone still joining this they havent updated it in over a month its practically useless now there are or so other programs out there that allow you to see nests plotted worldwide
TheSilphRoad,removed,i understand but it was pokeadvisor and that was weeks ago before it was taken down im just curious because i havent gotten an email about it or head of anyone else being banned for pokeadvisor i have from other iv things but not that one
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah this sub is everything i hoped rpokemongo would be i cant tell the difference between circlejerk and pokemongo subreddit sometimes
TheSilphRoad,removed,im seeing it on that other pokemon go subreddit too and it happened as the same time as new spawn points were added i believe this is legit and i hate it especially without trading in the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,different spawns for different people just changed now its probably an attack on people who use trackers except it hurts everyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,i lost both of mine this really sucks because i dont go out in walks anymore welp its been real
TheSilphRoad,removed,and even in areas with pokéstops but away from pokéstops so i have a reason to walk away from lures
TheSilphRoad,removed,im in the seattle area and really way a tracker but this is still utterly disappointing this seems like the worst possible version of a tracker and i was really hoping that they werent expanding the beta because they had other tracker ideas in the works
TheSilphRoad,removed,seattle and phoenixtempescottsdale arizona are the other tech hub cities on west coast
TheSilphRoad,removed,its pretty clear that if they expanded the same method to track the part continue to review community feedback is false because they didnt consider anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a rural player i wish they would roll it out to a few rural areas instead of arizona trhey could roll it out tonmthey dont care about rural platers anyhow
TheSilphRoad,removed,before the changes i had within reach of my house after the first change i had after the second change they removed and i had left now after this third change they removed the one that was left and i got seriously for gods sake now ill never catch pokémon unless my gps drifts and that is if they havent removed the other spawns nearby too yes im mad first they give you candy and then they take your candy away
TheSilphRoad,removed,doesnt seem to be the case im in rest of bay area and just got the new radar i dont have a lot of stops around me but i usually have full pokemon in sightings list most of the time now its only max possible and i have in nearby list checked google maps and the closest pokemon in the nearby is away thats a good minute walk since i have to follow the streets so it actually reduced the number of pokemon that are really around me to only of what was available before and gives me pokemon from pokestops that are a minute walk away sorry cant call this an improvement
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks like a popular scanning site is down too
TheSilphRoad,removed,months later and its still in limited areas not good enough it should have been out by now
TheSilphRoad,removed,ughjust showed up on the eastside in the seattlepuget sound area itll be great when youre in an area with a lot of stops but as expected its really really bad when youre well away from stops its now only showing me three spawns in my neighborhoodwith an eevee showing at the closest stop more than a mile away with a grade in between no niantic im not walking all that way to catch an eevee hopefully theyll continue to tweak it id like to revert to seeing more mons when there are no nearby stops and to specify what ones i never want to see in the new nearby
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think this is a poor substitute for proper tracking its too blunt walk here for this pokemon other pokemon that are in the area and arent using the system are still left to the current meh nearby list
TheSilphRoad,removed,what niantic is communicating its great but why did they take so long to increase the test area
TheSilphRoad,removed,well thats one way to shut down tracker bots for good p
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this is a thing now and not an accident in the coding then niantic will have finally killed the social aspect hunting pokemon in this game no linger will we be able to gather and say hey i just saw such and such pokemon over in that corner of the park
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic has all our best interests at heart
TheSilphRoad,removed,so if we say months for about cities we can look at having the feature in rural areas around well never
TheSilphRoad,removed,not when the nearest stop is a walk away and im not even rural i live in a city with barely any pokestops or gyms oh joy theres an abra at the school i couldnt even drive there fast enough to get it in minutes nbsp ive taken everything in stride with this game so far but this tracker is not what anyone needs besides people in super densely populated areas freaking joke
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems like niantic doesnt even care about anything except north americaless rare spawns in europe and asia and delays in update roll outsplaying the game here is definitely not as much fun as in the us
TheSilphRoad,removed,how bout the rest of the world
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe someone who understands the data mining of the party trackers better can clarify this but theres a party tracker go radar that works in sf even when the other trackers were shut down because it uses info from the ingame tracker so anyway im thinking maybe this will open up more places to working party trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game doesnt do anything people being stupid does just because something is there doesnt mean you have the right to go on private property
TheSilphRoad,removed,so at this rate the rest of the planet will have it in a year
TheSilphRoad,removed,place with zero pokestop get ready to quit the game lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,davis isnt turly apart of the bay area lol not even close but i guess niantic think it is lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry but this is just crap thus tracker is utter garbage the first tracker is better than this
TheSilphRoad,removed,exciting yes frustrating yes
TheSilphRoad,removed,but if they had left the tracker as it was before the update its not telling anyone to go anywhere anymore than the new tracker is and dont they have warnings telling players not to do that and cant they have people agree in the tos and such that if they break laws playing the game theyre still held accountable
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic are making a lot of changes they recently updated their api too
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry but i dont understand the excitement about this tracker for me now the fun in the game is to track down dragonites lapras and snorlaxs if i cant see all the pokemon in a radius around me reasonable reachable running distance during the remaining spawn time then its not even close to be as good as a party tracker obviously i dont want a pokemon list of all the pokemon in the said distance but i wish it was possible to filter everything i dont want to see so im sure not to miss any of these pokemon if one of them spawns near me
TheSilphRoad,removed,i absolutely hate gym battles its just tapping to a rhythm its awful
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this doesnt sound like a good thing my nearest pokéstops are well outside my sightings radius but the game is going to reduce what i can see in my immediate area so they can give me exact directions to a pokéstop instead do not like
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok how long before la what about smaller cities this is unfair gameplay all players should get equal treament we dont get a discount on lucky eggs of incubators depending on region if you are going to have a feature then do it fairly
TheSilphRoad,removed,so uh what they did is actually just add spawn points to pokestops make those show up when theres a spawn there and called it a day i have basically one stop in walking distance of me every other spawn point around me remains untrackable so this just means more power to stopchoked locations if i want to play the game i have to drive somewhere with stops and sit around stops rant
TheSilphRoad,removed,then again it would also be nice if we had the pokemon go experience we were all promised upon release
TheSilphRoad,removed,flip that thought on its head hope they add more pokestops roughly tripling or quadrupling the current number of pokestops especially in rural or underserved areas
TheSilphRoad,removed,the same tracker they have in san fransisco no thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not excited about this one bit there are possibly two stops in my area that could be in the nearby and they are more than minutes walking away so unless i get sightings and just nearby this will not be an improvement for me at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,they have to increase the spawn radius so that you can reach spawnpoints in gardenshouses from the outside and remove those golf cpurse nests that would solve most of the problems with luring people onto private property
TheSilphRoad,removed,im pretty sad that this is the version theyre moving ahead with i doubt any amount of community feedback will make them can this and work on something that doesnt require a blanket of pokéstops also something that doesnt just give you the exact position instead of making you play
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyre rolling it out parts of a state at a time that doesnt leave my notlocatedinus self feeling very optimistic
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is another crap being thrown at rural players now it is even less likely to see a lax on tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont like the new tracker not to mention that its going to be useful only in areas denselycovered by pokestops but im its obvious to me that the overall goal of this tracker is not helping us to track pokemon but rather get us near the pokestops and what stops niantic from making the sponsored pokestops more profitable spawning more rare pokemon nothing thats how you make your revenue
TheSilphRoad,removed,continue to review community feedback continue to review community feedback continue to review community feedback wow
TheSilphRoad,removed,so it was tested in one city for almost months now its expanded to few more cities without any visible change with this speed europe in early
TheSilphRoad,removed,from what im reading im not sure anybody with only a few pokestops nearby is going to be happy
TheSilphRoad,removed,its terrible my nearby list has never been representative of whats near me the spot could be right under my feet and up to away the nearby list has always sucked
TheSilphRoad,removed,unfortunately not the case this feature is near unusable for me in the suburbs i have very few pokestops near me and so the nearby feature gave me of them about miles away not km
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this is essentially the same as the tosbreaking scanners with the difference that it only works in areas with high pokestop density cant really see what the purpose in this design choice is
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes they are and we knew this months ago no offense
TheSilphRoad,removed,so many negative and unconstructive criticism lately i thought we were better than rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyone that has it please leave feedback on niantics site saying how bad it is
TheSilphRoad,removed,can people please stop calling this a tracker its not a tracker it doesnt tell you if you are getting nearer or further from a pokemon it doesnt indicate some kind of direction to a pokemon these are the things that trackers do all this does is tell you if pokemon are near to a pokestop how is that anything to do with tracking and why is niantic so hell bent on defying everything that made nintendo successful nintendos ethos was that games should start easy and gradually get harder pokemon go does the opposite making it easier to catch better pokeballs catch bonuses easier to gym battle better pokemon as your level rises nintendo believes in giving those lagging behind a boost to increase equality mario kart better drops in last place pokemon go sees players around pokestops in pokestop dense areas who have already had the advantage of being able to gain more items more pokemon more coinsstardust from gyms decides lets widen the gap even further and make it even easier for them to find certain pokemon if i were in nintendos shoes i would be seriously reviewing the partnership with niantic as they are proving to be an embarrassment
TheSilphRoad,removed,now another months until its available anywhere else
TheSilphRoad,removed,no thanks i will stick with the thirdparty ones doesnt work in non pokestoped area considering how niantic is deploying it will take years till the rest of os get this thing thay call as a tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,so essentially its f ucking useless then no point in having an update like this if it only works for certain people having a system like the steps worked absolutely everywhere it needs to be more like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is just niantic continuing their war against third party trackers if spawns are calculated on a user level theres no way to determine where pokemon will be
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is completely underwhelming only adds specific pokémon to specific stops doesnt do anything about hinting direction to other nearby pokémon that arent attached to a stop there was an excellent animated design mock from some guy which allowed you to select a pokemon in the nearby popup and showed a compass pointing in its general direction
TheSilphRoad,removed,after the loss of the original tracker the last thing i need as a suburban player is this garbage system in a city of unless i go downtown or the university there is like spawns per stop it just wont be functional for of the city
TheSilphRoad,removed,they can keep spawning mysterious this is a game of discovery if you work out the patterns then it loses some mystique yeah this holds no water for me pokemon has always been a game of discovery you learn what pokemon spawn where what time they spawn what special items they need to evolve it was never a game of mystery you were tasked by a scientist with investigating the world of pokemon and learning how it works learning those patterns niantic is constantly demolishing efforts to do exactly that by changing the way the world works every week or two they seem to be making it a waste of time to discover how the world works and how pokemon spawn a waste of time to bother trying to track and hunt pokemon instead they seem to want this to be a mysterious random pokemon lottery where you just run around aimlessly and hope you dumbly stumble upon the rare pokemon you need
TheSilphRoad,removed,this isnt a tracker and it will be a real shame if this is what they substitute it with
TheSilphRoad,removed,meh
TheSilphRoad,removed,on your greater point these twoweek periodic mass shifts in the game are really screwing with the hard core fan base trying to manifest the original pursuit of discovery as embedded in the original games indeed much of the research and continual advances we have been making feel worthless at this point maybe im also heavily biased by the loss of all three spawn points from my house which i treated as complementary to the overall target of frequenting parks and nests in search of rare pokémon no upgraded ingame tracker for me and really muddled nestspawn mechanics seriously considering dumping the app and focusing solely on my game boy emulator ive been playing since may which would be really disappointing because this game has really motivated me to walk more and get outdoors
TheSilphRoad,removed,not trying to be condesending or anything but has this game done anything to make it more playable for people not in an area surrounded by pokestops other than let you pay money for incense
TheSilphRoad,removed,they destroyed the one tracking system that was functional outside their test no tracker no money negative feedback until its fixed
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate the news system and i dont want it it adds nothing to the game and simply makes things way more pokestop oriented this is a huge step backward and the slap in the face for people that dont live downtown
TheSilphRoad,removed,what happened to the removed comments in this thread are valid opinions containing a dose of criticism will get removed by default now
TheSilphRoad,removed,what about the areas with no stops again a kick in the teeth for rural players
TheSilphRoad,removed,why do some of you even want this feature i am serious in my experience lax nite and other rares dont spawn at poke stops this update means that you only have instead of windows to have those rares shown on the sighting i used to be able to see a snolax on it if it is within and top now i can only see it if it is top that usually means it is really closeless likely
TheSilphRoad,removed,because those people will send different feedback than all of san francisco
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah now i will able to track a krabby that spawned away
TheSilphRoad,removed,worse niantics response to attempts to reduce this stress have been to rapidly attempt successfully to restore it as to niantic being unaware im pretty much guessing it would be easier to list what few things they are aware of being as they seem locked into their own course regardless of feedback if things like silphroad even have the slightest impact on their actions other than attempts to ruin it for the vision i would be surprised
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont like the new nearby just bring back the footstep tracker make the modifications needed then bring it back ffs
TheSilphRoad,removed,what do you mean rip is it down again
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,great at this pace the rest of the planet will get it by and it isnt even a real tracker screw rurals
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats bullshit if you actually think about it for a second rather than just saying is not a big number you can put together a trivial estimate of the significance assume poisson distributed numbers of over throws for the nonjumping sample youre looking at for the jumping sample youre looking at in other words if ops study worked like he says it does this naive estimate says youre looking at territory
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was just looking for that thread unsurprising the mods deleted it as it suggested this place was anything other than perfect read this comment while you can by the way
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow so it is either or nothing stupid design i would understand if it would take slots even though there is only spawn because of the need of the sightings title but to have a completely empty line is stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah its terrible having pokestop spawn even remotely near you effectively decreases your sightings by more than
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed they are a total disgrace to this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongo post
TheSilphRoad,removed,ios or android
TheSilphRoad,removed,look up pokealert pokemesh pokefarmer
TheSilphRoad,removed,uaaqaqaaqaaqqawaxiiilllllllluxpuuu😢🤤n😢😉🐱😀🎅🏻🎉🇾🇪🇪🇭🇻🇳🇺🇦🚡🇸🇿🇹🇴🇻🇨😤😞up😤🚑🤤😥🚐🚊🚘🚁🚊🚆🇾🇪🇿🇼🚝🚲🚁✈️😥🤤🤤🤤😠☹️😠😓😞😞🤡😪🤤😓😠😥☹️😢u☹️😓😓😞😓🤤wong o lol lyleuu okhhhjz youll by go phishh hobo
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe not so much a monster because his cp will sit him pretty low in every gym but he is a solid defender and a pain in the ass to take down
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think they gave up on botters and scanners too i see the same botters taking down gyms like clockwork same time same day of the week they do one part of town one day then another the next keep rotating never caught and scanners they are making a big comeback especially if you are an apple user
TheSilphRoad,removed,i caught one with ivs and it evolved into a fucking flareon every time i get one over this happens
TheSilphRoad,removed,this although with the current cp formula blissey would be a pain in the ass no matter what moveset
TheSilphRoad,removed,once the cat is out of the bag in terms of the formulas just using a spreadsheet to figure things out isnt against the tos though
TheSilphRoad,removed,i read somewhere that even talking about which pokemon spawns where and spreading data about the game is against the tos is it true
TheSilphRoad,removed,i appreciate what you accomplished thank you for that with that said the games fundamentalproblem is lack of encounters with pokemon bulbasaurs in my area are incredibly rare to a point im better off praying i get eggs which are incredibly rare and hatch them which are pidgies and caterpies they need to allow players to delete eggs they dont want and eliminate or decrease the trash that hatches from them its truly the only fix i can think of i do not want more eevees from eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey cool now not only is the step radar gone people who dont live in urban areas will have to work that much harder
TheSilphRoad,removed,last i heard using party forums to talk about aspects of the game was also against tos i dont know how true that is though and cant quote it i personally have no regard to any tos usually and accept any punishment i may accrue because of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,does this mean it will be impossible to get around theres no point playing the game without tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,its works i am at vaporeons i am very sorry you guys just are not smart enough maybe you should kill yourselves
TheSilphRoad,removed,i won a gym twice and in between winning and opening the gym up to slot my pokemon it was sniped both fucking times how about autohealing your pokemon for winning a gym and immmediately opening the menu to slot one in
TheSilphRoad,removed,a los of third trackers apps and bots dont really out any stress on the bandwidth also some developers even recreated a fully functional tracker just for the hell of it in a day and it didnt put any stress at all on the servers niantic is just too lazy and inefficient
TheSilphRoad,removed,not anymore smart poke is now dead which is a shame because i loved it
TheSilphRoad,removed,that was fast faster than any development of the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,not anymore im pretty sure all tracking apps are down at the moment as of earlier today
TheSilphRoad,removed,would smart poke work if i downgraded to the old version of pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,god you have charmanders fuck me id like some once trading is implemented i suspect youll have a lot of reason to be catching them but yeah theyre a tough case because they have the equal lowest catch rate of any unevolved pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,and by everyone on silph road you mean the guy who wrote the thread title and i
TheSilphRoad,removed,at work so i cant use my phone anyone try pokepro or pikapika
TheSilphRoad,removed,since this horrible update my current community of strong in las vegas has compiled and confirmed our newest list of nests in the local areas surrounding las vegas my question is how in the worldpun intended does niantic expect people to randomly walk around the world gathering pokémon without a proper map tracking system to narrow the search fields down to a reasonable area granted pokevision may have been a little too detailed and real time for the creators liking but as many users have provenover on pokevisions poll on twitter and the apps rating plummeting they hate the app now and will not even play the game without a viable option of narrowing our search to a reasonable area im not against making a profit yes even in a so called free to play game but pathetic greed causing you to change the gamemaking everything much harder to catch and taking away tracking which essentially forces people to pay to playreasonablyworthy play anyway should be illegal i already supported the game with my when it was fun to play because of the viable trackingof sites like pokevision but now i demand my money back for them screwing over us loyal and paying users boycottpokemongofornotracking proper tracking too not that patheticvery limited step no directional excuse for very limited tracking not to mention the interaction rangeour pulsing circle needs to be increased by double to help keep people off private properties and out of dangerous places
TheSilphRoad,removed,current rumor is traffic is now encrypted people are trying to reverseengineer the packets to preguess what keys to use on the fake traffic for trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,they really dont want me to play their game lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was trying to see if there was an update for pokemesh and couldnt find it in the play store so maybe google took it down in corroboration with ninatic
TheSilphRoad,removed,if anyone is interested in the following the situation updates are in a sticky over at rpokemondev currently all requests made to the pogo servers that dont originate from the client are returning blank responses it seems like it will be difficult to get around the new security measures at least as of right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i dont know how youre expecting me to find any pokemon without any tracking websites maybe ill run into a snorlax by pure luck if indeed a hash function is involved im not too optimistic
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongodev rpokemongobotting some botters are less careful about their ingame identity than others
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongodev rpokemongobotting some people are not careful about their ingame name
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongodev rpokemongobotting blatant cheaters everywhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,i seriously doubt its a hack i browse many of those sites and have seen nothing about creating pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,what does this mean for pokeadvisor not working for me at the moment but it does this periodically
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongodev rpokemongobotting some people are not careful about their ingame name
TheSilphRoad,removed,yet go radar by will cobb in app store does
TheSilphRoad,removed,the best thing for the future of pokemon go would be if the ceo had a sudden heart attack and died
TheSilphRoad,removed,real world trading black market use your brain why has anyone botted anything ever for money dumbass
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongodev rpokemongobotting some people are not careful about their ingame name
TheSilphRoad,removed,rpokemongodev rpokemongobotting some people are not careful about their ingame name reporting is our only defense
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont like people complaining in this subreddit so ill complain cant fault that logic
TheSilphRoad,removed,to clarify i wasnt referring to the whales money spenders but rather the top of progression time spenders in pokemon go and i dont think this game has as strong of a correlation between those groups as some other games if were catering to the top of spenders in a game with ample moneysinks then pleasing them can be completely economically justifiable and very sound business practice but i dont think the current structure of the pokemon go can currently support a focus on that through minor improvements in content there just isnt enough stuff to buy or enough incentive to buy them unless more is added to this game i absolutely agree with the business philosophy of catering to the top spenders in a game as they are the lifeblood of any game but things are however slightly different in the casual microtransaction world because especially as this game is still new and hot growing the userbase by doubledigit percentages through deployment in new regions will likely trump the revenue increases gained by improvements in user satisfaction especially if focused on people who simply spent a ton of time on the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is a trivial issue existent in everything to do with trading from school kids being bullied out of pokemon cards to african countries being bullied out of cocoa beans by western countries
TheSilphRoad,removed,omg now you have to click edit and fix it rage more kidlol and yes i will put as many as i want kma
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only way id ever get one or two pokemon maxed out is on a bot account
TheSilphRoad,removed,the people complaining just suck lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,faggot
TheSilphRoad,removed,no im pretty sure this is actually more a martin fury situation it looks like a niantic employee gave someone a pokemon they shouldnt have which that person was then using to take and control gyms with martin fury a blizzard employee gave a player a developer item which they then used to kill raid bosses assuming everyone involved is telling the truth its pretty much the same someone in niantic fucked up but leaving the pokemon out there is detrimental to the game removing the articuno is exactly what they should do
TheSilphRoad,removed,you have no right to tell me what rights i have
TheSilphRoad,removed,bad coding on pokego what a surprise
TheSilphRoad,removed,im a musician man
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyone went and gave the game stars when it first came out and every part of the game was horribly broken they probably are rating the game before it even installs ugh
TheSilphRoad,removed,dratini nests should come back at some point i hope you cant have people wondering around with dragonites but not give a chance for others to do the same ever again though now i think about it that sounds exactly like something niantic would do
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes its filled with heroin nests badumtssss
TheSilphRoad,removed,how about you jus delete the game why should the majority cater to the minority
TheSilphRoad,removed,subscribed flair selected edt code
TheSilphRoad,removed,code plz ¯ツ¯
TheSilphRoad,removed,where the codes at
TheSilphRoad,removed,report them just because they r beat ur ass funny
TheSilphRoad,removed,to be fair op my biggest complaint about the game is not operational bugs or even party tracker shutdowns although this did ruin how myself and my friend planned our weekend outings my biggest gripe is that it feels like pokemon have been changed by way of capture rate and how far away they are to intentionally be a waste of pokeballs in an effort to get people to buy more from the shop i had a pidgeot spawn on my when i set up a lure yesterday but it was litearlly impossible to catch no matter how hard or fast i threw the pokeball it fell just short of connecting this also happens more commonly with golbats and even when the pokemon is close enough to catch i find myself using on average pokeballs per pidgey its absolutley ridiculious the game balance was nearly perfect on release you rarely see that happen in games these changes are dirty cash grab tactics and niantic did not need to resort to using them there was no reason for this and it ruined the game literally thousands of people
TheSilphRoad,removed,but booty makes it easier to handle
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats with the circle jerking on this sub this isnt rpokemongo you do realize that you whining about the people who were whining is just as bad right
TheSilphRoad,removed,the very center of san pedro sula like literally the center i am not shitting you
TheSilphRoad,removed,idk if im stupid but where is the scan button
TheSilphRoad,removed,this appears to only work in nyc im downtown in a major city that is not nyc and nothing appears on my map
TheSilphRoad,removed,it doesnt seem to work though when i scroll away from the start point of the map pokemon are not displayed
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing appears on my country
TheSilphRoad,removed,in nyc and can confirm works for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,this only works in nyc
TheSilphRoad,removed,it works in central london aswell
TheSilphRoad,removed,training meaning powering up our pokemon were against other trainers it is what it is if they implement pvp and low level players want to challenge those with low level pokemon then thatll be their game but ashe it stands we use our most powerful on the gyms to hold the gyms why should a new player be able to take out the snorlax ive spent levels powering up with their low cp pokemon ive been out walking my ass off for that dust and candy theyll get there and itll take time ive invested more so yeah i feel my powerful pokemon are a testament to my time invested into the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,so there was an awesome puzzles and dragon one that someone built with a camera and an articulated pointer that would calculate and perform the optimal shuffling of things that was a hack project that id give props to image recognition pattern solving and physical manipulation all in one
TheSilphRoad,removed,they are going to remove catching pokemons
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah the bug was greed design change for increased micro transactions and the announcement comes out after a few days of massive outcry and negative reviews bombing them worldwide glad they are reverting it though
TheSilphRoad,removed,with the new code string they threw in to verify the original app all everything party has temporarily stoped till a work around is found fret not tho because although niantic have good programmers i feel like we as a community are better we will prevail or they will get pogo right one of the two
TheSilphRoad,removed,live in the middle of nowhere going to try now and see what happens
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have one gym near me right now but the assholes who own live right down the block everytime i start battling it they drive to the gym and just train on it staggered so i dont get a chance to fight it its bullshit but everytime they dont show up i take the gym its totally doable solo but these guys are c u next tuesdays and i just needed to vent about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,were at max capacity until we make this server upgrade happen friend apologies for the delay watch the sub and well post more information as soon as we can
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah no yesterday i got the ball freeze glitch on two separate pidgeys that were under cp i force closed the app and upon reopening it each time i had no pidgey and was short all the pokeballs i had used in the encounter i was level or so so a level pidgey escaping even once would be pretty unheard of certainly not twice in an hour
TheSilphRoad,removed,instinctorextinct
TheSilphRoad,removed,or they can play the fucking game
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah like donald trump
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just hatched mine im at and i levelled it up to the thing came with thirty candies how high is yours at the moment
TheSilphRoad,removed,i got a shitty onyx
TheSilphRoad,removed,im level i have never joined a team and have never bought anything rural player
TheSilphRoad,removed,especially the top of it
TheSilphRoad,removed,prove it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel like these posts should be considered spam at this point they are here i feel every single day
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,um screw their greedyass shop what they should do and should have been doing the entire time is giving us a reasonable rewards system after level leveling up means nothing as far as rewards go one noninfinite incubator every or levels one lucky egg at the same intervals why at level which borderline requires substantially more items seeing as by that point there are ten different options that can drop from pokestops are the drop rates the same as someone at level in terms of number of items that are given obviously at later levels we need way more stuff hi spare a few more ultraballs please so i dont understand why at level increases we arent legitimately rewarded ie a pokestop spin will drop minimum six items instead of three why as we level up and clearly require more bag space and pokémon storage only available via coins are we not rewarded even slightly there at level it takes way more space than the given to play efficiently and by then collections of pokémon have accumulated which need space as well niantic even if its every five levels give us a reason to look forward to reaching them increase our storage by even give us room to stock up on supplies since we are gives a much wider range of them in later levels and need so many more especially with everyone now wasting hardearned balls on pidgeys and rattataa hoping theyre dittos you despicably smart evildoers well so that was quite a rant must have struck a nerve interesting
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes rpokemongo is for posting clipping pics of slowbros humping oddishes and other such shtposts
TheSilphRoad,removed,city trainer stops all over the place evanston wyoming would like a word with you largest city in wyoming
TheSilphRoad,removed,theres plenty on youtube lazyass never even attempt to search before asking expecting people to spoon feed
TheSilphRoad,removed,such sloppy work from niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel like they did this so they can say this is their biweekly update they waited to say anything about this change so it could count as a biweekly update
TheSilphRoad,removed,think you should talk about diminishing returns on cp when leveling above lvl dont do it unless you really really really need to
TheSilphRoad,removed,this
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah the day tsr became
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would actually stop playing the game out of principles if they do this
TheSilphRoad,removed,screw starbucks and mcdoanlds of all the small companys they could help they side with them btw gen is not coming cant wait to read niantics twitter after it does not come out this year
TheSilphRoad,removed,played ingress from the week of beta on just get used to it every time the add some new security measure the spoofers find a way around and it ends up only biting the normal players in the ass there is really no way to completely keep it from happening
TheSilphRoad,removed,you mean ill be able to pay to play this game where do i sign
TheSilphRoad,removed,it was supposed to come out on august
TheSilphRoad,removed,you have a dratini nest son of a bitch
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems like you find excuses if you ask me when you claim there is a difference than give me a reason cheating is cheating doesnt matter if you use a wallhack or an aimbot to name the two of the most common cheats both are bad for the game as long as there are people who play with the tools the developers deliver its not fair to give yourself an advantage and say something broken and i just fixed it for me thats still an advantage you get over other players which would be considered cheating dont get me wrong i have no problem with you or someone else using these programstools but dont justify it as clearly ok and blame people who use a gps manipulator just an example to let you understand where i am coming from if you are in really rural areas you find one pokemon every miles or even more like i already said when i watch streamers in big cities they can literally sit or go wherever they want and they find a new pokemon every meters or one pops up right after they caught the last one obviously that sucks for people in local areas because of the huge disadvantage you have i made probably twice the miles of summitbig streamer made but for every pokemon i caught he caught in the same time thats cool for him and i dont have a problem with that but defenitly sucks for people like me espcially when i have to drive a mile for a single pokestop sure you could say i can drive in a city but i dont have the time to do that every day and probably not even every week to be honest the only reason i didnt use gps manipulation is that you have to root your phone for it if there was an easier way i would probably do it so if i walk now km in real life with my phone in hand and later let my gps tool let me walk km in new york you think that is ok of course not because even if i walked the km i have a huge advantage over people in my local area so in my opinion the easiest way to avoid a lot of gps manipulations would be make decent spawn locations all over the world and not just in big cities or change the xp system so that you can catch more rare pokemon in rural areas which gives a lot more xpmight be otherbetter ways also in my opinion they shouldnt spend resources in an anti cheat team when you can fix the main issue by fixes the game of course there will still be some people who will cheat anyway but it would be way less i stopped playing the game for now and all my friends dropped it already after a few days because they dont want to deal with a pokemon in the only arena near our place after the game was released for days when you are like level after miles there is no point and no fun in playing the game anymore because you have to invest way more time compared to others which feels unfair maybe i am to biased and dont see something here but thats just how i feel i dont claim to be correct in every aspect but i hope you get from where i am coming
TheSilphRoad,removed,god damn it
TheSilphRoad,removed,do we think the new code will show up where the old one is crossed out
TheSilphRoad,removed,where the new code must have
TheSilphRoad,removed,edt im ready for codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,me taps foot
TheSilphRoad,removed,where are they
TheSilphRoad,removed,is it not where is the code ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
TheSilphRoad,removed,its time right where is the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats todays code oo ive been waiting two days lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,okay im a little confused came here yesterday with the post saying codes would be posted what i understood as today at est come back to check and now it says those are taken and to come back tomorrow at edt because of the post dates im not sure when today is today and not yesterday and tomorrow is tomorrow and not today is there a way to see the actual date they mean too
TheSilphRoad,removed,waiting for the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,are the codes out yet its already edt pst where i am
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,code doesnt work
TheSilphRoad,removed,are the codes done allready i get invalid access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,the shellder code is invalid according to the website any chance im doing something wrong
TheSilphRoad,removed,getting invalid code error as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,code didnt work
TheSilphRoad,removed,growlithe is somewhere near hudson oh and the magmar nest is in euclid oh northeast oh has a few nests that i am aware ofi know of a ponyta nest in lakewood park lakewood oh and a scyther nest in rocky river reservation down at the marina rocky river oh
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is sketchy as shit haha trade now get delivered when niantic includes trading you mean give us your info now and get scammed until niantic adds training and then get scammed some more
TheSilphRoad,removed,using this tool you can get a rating for your pokémon httpsthesilphroadcomresearch but theres a little too much guess work specifically step positioning the cp arc you eyeball it so it matches your screen on your phone and then verify by checking the stardust and candies are the same people then narrow it down by powering up the pokémon narrowing the range of possible matches well there is a better way i created a template using gimp httpwwwgimporg photo editing program simply print the template cut out with a pair of scissors laminate if you like and hold the template up to your screen it can be a little tricky not to scroll your screen while you do this but you quickly get the hang of it i recently scanned through all pokémon that i had in my bag this still took a couple hours to determine their strength using the pokémon rater here on silphroad i didnt have to feed any candies to figure out their exact level simply used the template disclaimer if it is a level or level mon you may still have some ambiguity heres a picture of a couple templates i made a unique template is required for every trainer level what the bleep how do i insert multiple images into a reddit post oh well heres a link and here is a link to my pokémon now labeled with their percentile score from the rater and here is a link to the gimp image file that i used to create the templates with layers that you can turn on and off for trainer levels it is a xcf file i dont know if photoshop users can open it but gimp is free sot hats what i have i can upload it in photoshop format if their is demand also can add more trainer levels if their is demand sorry for the long urls apparently tiny ones are not allowed
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant wait for more please put this pokemon into the easytousecalculator for me posts that have been driving this subreddits growth
TheSilphRoad,removed,please read some more articles because you clearly dont know what you are talking about
TheSilphRoad,removed,we have the best road dont we
TheSilphRoad,removed,its almost like upvoting his comment would accomplish the same thing as your post
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats what she said
TheSilphRoad,removed,people literally still play this joke of a game lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh boy this game is turning to and in the worst way forcing people to buy pogo wow
TheSilphRoad,removed,boy we better downvote this guys so he knows how much we are laughing at him rthesilphroad
TheSilphRoad,removed,just fine is a bit generous considering the convoluted method people had to come up with i mean you might be used to it but compared to the old tracking method its pretty silly
TheSilphRoad,removed,the amount of incorrect in this is mind boggling nice wall of text but you lost me at the low index numberlow ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,for that one can simply use the upvote button
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think you should read what you wrote
TheSilphRoad,removed,geez i have never even seen a snorlax in the wild and your neighborhood is crawling with them what tracker are you using
TheSilphRoad,removed,why did you remove the step feature only to replace it with nothing in months follow up when he gives the bs make it better answer by make it better you mean the far worse feature that less than of users currently access to that does nothing for suburban or rural players do you even plan on giving that feature to all or have you abandoned that too do you have any plans whatsoever to improve the gameplay experience for suburban and rural players such as better spawns and more pokestopsgyms have you hired a community manager if not why have your current two had zero community interaction in months if so why has somebody with a masters degree in public relations as required on the job listing also had zero interaction in over a month do you plan on revising the stat formula to better incorporate speed and other stats from the original game since the current implementation is very flawed and leaves things quite unbalanced between types since you know nothing about pokemon can you take a recording of these questions back to the office and give it any of your employees who do can you let the employees from actually talk to the community etc etc
TheSilphRoad,removed,without some serious changes four years out they might hit that planned peak
TheSilphRoad,removed,its completely retarded everytime i launch the game i can no longer listen to music which sucks big time why the fsck does the app have to have exclusive access to audio its a simple fix as well
TheSilphRoad,removed,still no indications of them reconsidering their stance on rooted or jailbroken devices disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont think hacker means what he thinks it means
TheSilphRoad,removed,and also the useless ones
TheSilphRoad,removed,hanke the mankey make it viral hankeythemankey
TheSilphRoad,removed,he gives no time frame one when submissions will be opened back up could be years doesnt say that theyll prioritize rural area submissions first and the subject of almost nonexistant spawns in rural areas isnt even brought up that in addition to the supposed im from a small town and ive played in rural areas and its fine statements are him just trying to play it off like its not actually a problem again ಠಠ
TheSilphRoad,removed,speaking in broad terms is an excellent way to avoid being held accountable for anything you say politicians use it all the time
TheSilphRoad,removed,um i find it interesting that he didnt mention combat balancingdoes that mean he thinks its fixed with the buddy system or something lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,hackers on reddit you mean the people who fixed your broke game
TheSilphRoad,removed,reddit hanke personally mentioned the hackers on reddit and their anger for the first time personally i think thats pretty sad that the reddit go community is gonna be tainted by that in niantics eyes we have so much to offer besides rage and illicitly hammering their servers he is specifically referring to rpokemongodev i guarantee it
TheSilphRoad,removed,that whole sorting has always been the case is not the case for me usually dont put in info if its not confirmed
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont know why people would take offence its just a webpage we happen to post on
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think weve seen five types of people using the pogo apis in a manner that breaks the tos reverse engineering community some people just like to take things apart to see how they work particularly software engineers these people do what they do and almost certainly wont ever be stopped mappers scanners these people tend to believe the games tracking spawning systems are broken in their current state in order to fix the game they use scanners andor mappers to find pokemon personally i am willing to bet that the number of people in this category would drop dramatically if niantic did the following a communicate more clearly that they believe there are marked issues with nonurban areas and engage the community at large with regards to potential fixes an example of a team that does this properly is blizzard with starcraft right now it isnt clear what niantic actually thinks of the tracking system aside from having pulled threestep betatesting a pokestoptracker in sf and some general comments approximating dislike like jh b release a tracking system that is at least as good and efficient protractor warriors im looking at you when i say this as the original threestep system researchers these people sometimes use thirdparty apis to obtain statistically useful information about the game we wouldnt have several of the insights confirmation of spawn biomes possible pokedexiv correlations catchchance confirmations weve gleamed in past months without these people like the reverse engineering folks these people will never entirely stop using the pogo apis in ways that break the games tos with that said if niantic provided more details about the game thered be less of a need to perform research and thus less potential for api abuse botters spoofers unethical theres one constant in the gaming world if someone builds a halfdecent game someone else will figure out a way to cheat at it these people are a force of nature and can never be entirely stopped only limited spoofers ethical some people the sick or otherwise impaired could not play pokemon go without the ability to spoof ive seen a couple threads on various pogorelated subs about this and i always find it sad that theres no way for these people to enjoy the game other than to employ the same methods as cheaters so while we may not be able to glorify the re community i believe it would be reasonable for all of us to keep in mind that there are a wide range of reasons for people to use the pogo apis in ways that break the tos
TheSilphRoad,removed,the first because it is the only one that actually affects gameplay other than that as long as you arent playing offensive music why care what pissed me off is last week i saw some fat slob of a dad screaming at his preschooler son because his son tried to catch a pikachu on his own and it ran i mean ffs captain jackass hes a kid and its just a game i wanted to deck him in the face but i couldnt decide which chin to aim for oh also the entire crowd of oblivious fucktards that ran out in front of my cab to cover the feet between them and the kabutops spawn scared the poor driver half to death he had to stop and take a breather
TheSilphRoad,removed,it sounds like you had a soft ip ban during that time
TheSilphRoad,removed,some folks i met said they encountered some i havent but the one i use most was having an issue with the time left being a minute off also the folks werent aware of the different spawn types like the one that is up down up
TheSilphRoad,removed,a lot of tracker apps adding random false positives on purpose to make it seem better working reconsider the particular app or make a personal map with results you can rely on
TheSilphRoad,removed,who the hell wrote that that is not an adequate way to insert relevant explanatory information into a quote you either put them in brackets inside the quote or format the sentence in such a way thatwell it doesnt look like that for example on the possibility of holding events for pokémon go hanke said i think we probably will
TheSilphRoad,removed,what do you mean by he had better to stop playing that much do you mean he shouldnt be playing so much because he is years old
TheSilphRoad,removed,off because people are realizing pokemongo isnt that great with all the issues it has and how much theyve changed in it
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you are manually checking spawn points you may miss something but the island in my city is fully covered by scanners and we have twitter feed for that so anything spawned will be recorded its very weird not a single lapras spawned in days
TheSilphRoad,removed,we got a working local scanner with twitter notifications the day before the event there have lapras in a day and since then not a single one i already had that suspicion aswell
TheSilphRoad,removed,i honestly hate the training nerf when you can drop a level gym in mins solo yet it would take hours to train the same gyms are too far apart for me to be able to blitz multiple before im kicked out
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic is incompetent dont expect this
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is our endgame now
TheSilphRoad,removed,nice grammar
TheSilphRoad,removed,rthathappened
TheSilphRoad,removed,when you are not black and white to spoofing i hope this thread gets locked this reddit is not about discussion cheats
TheSilphRoad,removed,surely there are a number of factors at play the change in spawn mechanics the realization that nest maps quickly become obsolete and dwindling interest among all but hardcore players
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is definitely the case for me i used to do pretty frequent updates to the nest atlas but after the gym update ive honestly started to not see any point in the game with the pokedex being done ages ago whats left just catch a bunch of pokemon that will collect dust in your storage the only gameplay in the game was gyms and theyve completely made training redundant now and turned gyms into a coins onestop before somebody else can come along quickly take it down and claim their coins as well and move on how fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah how convenient you had a local nest
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel like this is too harsh of a reply for a simple suggestion hes not begging for anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup i did that i mapped my entire city after any migration using scanners and updated the atlas for everyone now thats gone i really dont know whats going to happen at the next migration people dont update the atlas and dont really share info
TheSilphRoad,removed,since the new update it really makes no difference if you defend a gym with a cp weedle or a laprassnorlax both will last the same amount of time which begs the question what os even the point of all my stronger pokemon makes more sense to just use useless pidgys and save a revive
TheSilphRoad,removed,downvotred not silphroad worthy
TheSilphRoad,removed,web scanners might be down but androidios scanning is still a thing
TheSilphRoad,removed,so funny now next month when you raise or levels you will be completelly bored trainers are leaving the game i´m playing around of the time i did before other high levels of my group left the game now pokgo is a alone game groups don´t deserve anything new gym system is a complete disaster it only deserves to casual players for a little time until they level up their accounts and left the game due to boring
TheSilphRoad,removed,its easier and takes less items for me to knock down an enemy level gym than prestige a friendly level gym to thats why the new gym system sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been less than a week and theyre already trying to get filthy rich off this game lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,you think people think things like this when hunting few will most wont
TheSilphRoad,removed,were changing up the whole webapp interface as we speak once that goes live itll be oauth only
TheSilphRoad,removed,hail hitler instead of dabbing
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol reminds me of the clitoris never heard of that pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,so many awesome people dab ehhhh
TheSilphRoad,removed,only the people not dabbing are awesomethe others should all be hung drawn and quartered
TheSilphRoad,removed,haha pointsi see people are butthurt about their beloved dab
TheSilphRoad,removed,you guys are wayyyyyy out of your league this si going to backfire on you
TheSilphRoad,removed,the birds have been released at official events just met with someone who showed me his that he caught at an event last week and as i said the master balls will be in a future update
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game isnt even fully released yet give them a little time to get their shit together
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibicycleperformance energy efficiency a human being traveling on a bicycle at – kmh – mph using only the power required to walk is the most energyefficient means of human transport generally available on firm flat ground a kg lb person requires about watts to walk at kmh mph that same person on a bicycle on the same ground with the same power output can travel at kmh mph using an ordinary bicycle so in these conditions the energy expenditure of cycling is onethird of walking typical speeds in utility cycling there is a large variation an elderly person on an upright roadster might do less than kmh mph while a fitter or younger person could easily do twice that on the same bicycle for cyclists in copenhagen the average cycling speed is kmh mph on a racing bicycle a reasonably fit rider can ride at kmh mph on flat ground for short periods sure you could go over the speed limit but youd have to be putting in some effort youre much more likely to be going under the speed limit than you are to be going over it unless youre actively trying to do it not saying that youre wrong but you are
TheSilphRoad,removed,max level when pokes hit
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes we get it you are lucky because of where you live and boo hoo to those who dont have access to this
TheSilphRoad,removed,lazy devs with no plan for their game
TheSilphRoad,removed,for the vast majority of players now the gym system is completely unusable anyway during the first month i routinely trained at gyms taking down big cp pokemon through attrition now its rare that i see a gym with even a single pokemon i could beat with my top six so for almost everyone playing especially those who didnt play more than an hour a day for the first month or who dont spend money in game the game is essentially only about collecting at this point
TheSilphRoad,removed,all hail atlas for his guidance
TheSilphRoad,removed,you guys need to add an option to unregisterdelete our accounts for those of us who the map doesnt help at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,and now the automod didnt like that i said a bad word garbage for children
TheSilphRoad,removed,i need to change my location i am in texas and the silph road has me registered in pennsylvania help please
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a douchebag op i found a great spot doesnt tell share the spot
TheSilphRoad,removed,is not this sounds stupid but anyway is is but the would hit for a little bit less i dont know the actual coefficients out of my head i would say if his eevee evolves into vaporeon it is still better than of all the other vaporeons i saw so far
TheSilphRoad,removed,fastpokemapse glhf
TheSilphRoad,removed,i should have or shouldnt have i didnt vote at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,screw you for not reading i uploaded this via the app and put in the first comment that this spot is in finland a bit far for you to travel
TheSilphRoad,removed,who invited this guy
TheSilphRoad,removed,soon you will be able to get to level by buying it from niantic s
TheSilphRoad,removed,using none atm why its useless with current gym battling system
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not even sure it works when i do submit so a lot of times i dont why isnt there a confirmation or case when you submit
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh look this guy just made an automated bot play the game for him but he clearly didnt know what he was doing lets forgive him so he can keep claiming coins well done niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing unsafe about it crowdsourced nonscraping i rely on it to plan routes when i travel to new areas its pretty terrific
TheSilphRoad,removed,trizzydizzy gave a correct answer but heres a more detail for why numbers may be a bit wrong the concept is the same after a defending pokemon finishes a quick attack they wait seconds before attaching again this makes it so water gun goes from damages every seconds to damage every seconds now water pulse takes seconds to use and does damage however because it is a charge attack vaporeon does not have to wait seconds before using another attack because doing a receiving damage causes your energy gauge to fill up a vaporeon will be able to use another water pulse after using just one more water gun or directly after using a water pulse it ends up that the increase in dps caused by alternating between water guns and water pulses is much greater than the dps of using water gun anywhere from times and then using a hydropump which also has a long animation time in addition to the increase of raw dps there is also the issue of how many times a vaporeon would be able to use hydropump overkill and dodging if a vaporeon dies during the hydropump animation or even when hydropump is halfway charged they missed out on a lot of dps if a vaporeon manages to use hydropump when your attacker is already about to die they then dont fully utilize the majority of their dps these both make the attack a lot weaker for defenders finally there is dodging hydropump has a strength of while water pulse has a strength of this meas that you would have to dodge water pulses to roughly match dodging a single hydropump not only would this be more difficult to do but making your opponent dodge times forces them to decrease their pokemons dps but remember this is only for defenders for any attacker charge moves that have very tiny energy bars are shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,let the you cant get to level by end of october and the like replies incoming
TheSilphRoad,removed,shirt walk or shit walk or are you a teekkari what about haalarit do they count sori sori kiitti vinkistä tulen vkonloppuna apajille
TheSilphRoad,removed,slowbro is a great defender especially if its confusionpsychic or ice beam it has pretty good defensive scores and very good stamina stab on the psychic moves that very few pokemon can resist people think that since slowbro is water type they can roll up with a grass pokemon but what they forget is that slowbro is waterpsychic type and gets stab for those quick attacks and most grass pokemon are grasspoison except tangela and exeggutor i think receive super effective damage on psychic attacks also exeggutor fast attacks zen headbutt and confusion are resisted by slowbro and even if you did roll up with a tangela slowbro could hit you with icebeam only real weakness is against electricsteel types with electric attacks that can resist psychic and deal super effective damage which afaik is just magneton even an equal cp jolteon might have trouble attacking without dodging golem is a poor defender right now because it has low hp and receives super effective damage from water and everyone has a strong vape with hydro pump nidoqueen suffers from poison and ground typing which means very common waterpsychic types like starmie and slowbro and golduck which has psychic attacks kick its ass vileplume and venosaur has lowish hp and are susceptible to fire which have high attacks stats in flareon and arcanine
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive never paid for a microtransaction in any game on any platform in the past years theyve really been a thing when go got popular in junejuly and i first started playing i thought id continue that trend i live in a suburb so not much shit around and it was boring then i discovered a park a mile from my crib with a big mile walking path and like pokestops on it since then ive spent roughly bucks on incubators and incense turned a game i was almost completely disinterested in into something that changed my daily routine if they add trading battling or revamp the gym system ill probably spend more
TheSilphRoad,removed,i decided to buy coins once i hit level heres my reasoning if i had bought another xbox game it would have cost me and i would have been sitting at home on my ass for the last month instead ive been walking daily lost over pounds in the first week visited tons of parks and other places i would not have otherwise experienced made new friends and spent more time with existing ones in a facetoface setting i spent and bought bag space and more pokemon storage because i had already gotten well over of value out of the game and those were the areas i really struggled with since then i havent spent a cent on the game and i use my hardwon gym coins to buy incubators and occasionally lucky eggs for massevolves i dont have to worry much about my bag overflowing or not having room for that snorlax i finally tracked down i get to just play and plan my purchases out according to what i will need in the end theres no right or wrong way to go about it if you have the money to waste spend on enough incenses to fill your pokedex from your couch then good on you and also can we be best friends if you want to earn every single pokecoin you get by collecting from gyms then do it as long as youre enjoying the game and not being a dick to other people then its all good
TheSilphRoad,removed,bloody right bugger that daft arsehole shag that automod right in the fanny
TheSilphRoad,removed,i went to check my razzberries and i had holy fuck i just stopped using them for some reason and thats taking up so much space haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,base on my experience body slam is annoying but still dodgeable and not ko your poke hyper beam second made me miss my attack ryhm more often and would take out half to all my heal bar if hit i say im more worry of hyper beam defender
TheSilphRoad,removed,congratulations you found a coincidence i saw an eevee at my house my house has eaves eaves eevee profit i caught a pidgey at a clothing store a shirt had a picture of a bird on it therefore that shirt summoned the pidgey buy all the shirts get all the pidgeys i caught a hitmonlee in the city if i draw lines using the streets i can spell hit therefore i found a place anywhere in the city that spelled p and found pidgey new mechanic confirmed
TheSilphRoad,removed,then the post would get way less noticed eventually even ignored because humans are just prone to prefer visual data over text especially when starting right with an image ive studied that shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,incubator seriously sucks so i cant hatch eggs wothout paying pokemongos boxes safes whatever
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are working out of game trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,then again the hint about an easter egg wasnt even necessary and likely didnt actually cause anyone to find anything pikachu moving to the shoulder was probably discovered by thousands of people independently you didnt need to know to be looking for anything were there any other instances in which tsr seemed to have insider tips
TheSilphRoad,removed,its fuckíng click bait
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for doing this very appreciated d i ran the formula in a spreadsheet with all pokemon and there were some interesting surprises for pokemon max cp tyranitar rock dark blissey normal donphan ground espeon psychic heracross bug fighting scizor bug steel ursaring normal feraligatr water ampharos electric typhlosion fire normal houndoom fire dark
TheSilphRoad,removed,you gotta give it a chance people always assume because its not the best possible out there its not good well shit its good man trust me
TheSilphRoad,removed,new tracker is useless for me i can no longer see anything around me but a stop that is away
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope this never goes live in my area horrible implementation
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow arent you cynical people all around the world both here and on facebook suddenly all saying at practically the same time that they caught ditto deal with it
TheSilphRoad,removed,boy are gonna be salty in a day
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey everybody look at this genius over here
TheSilphRoad,removed,im trying to understand why most people are excited if this is the new tracker without any further additions i think its the final straw for myself and everyone i know i dont even live in a rural area how is this fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,this nearby system completely destroyed any hope of tracking anything within walking distance why
TheSilphRoad,removed,why not just handing it over to everyone because if you go through life expecting people to give you shit you will never be the very best
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly and i only have pokestop nearby when no pokemon is theremy tracker is blank dumb
TheSilphRoad,removed,this tracker is terrible now instead of seeing a bunch of pokemon i can get by walking outside for a minute i see commons at the nearby pokestops total garbage
TheSilphRoad,removed,sightings still show up but you have to be closer than before
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks like niantic really wants us to use party trackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow that sucks surely they cannot do that
TheSilphRoad,removed,sadly yes
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill comment here since i somehow missed this when i made my own post it sucks that niantic didnt fix the memory leaks before forcing us to update loading gyms really chugs now and max memory usage for me jumped from to android also not looking forward to the changes when attacking gyms since i rely on dodges but maybe ill get used to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic losing another set of users rooted users budget phone users does niantic want to reduce their user base what is their logic do they have more than enough money
TheSilphRoad,removed,confirmed i think its fair in order to avoid two different kinds of gym battle however they could specify the change to the battling system in their minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep they are also cutting off a good portion of their no doubt higher level more technical players by doing this making the game easier to play for the casual whales
TheSilphRoad,removed,im so done i was looking forwards to this game since announcement i bought a brand new huawei to play it and now i cant do that i shouldnt have to learn how to root and flash roms just to play a game on a phone that came pre rooted i feel so betrayed honestly this game did so much good for me and now i feel like ive been stabbed in the back
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpimgurcomagzivu
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a rom developer this absolutely kills the game for me now me and users of my rom cant play the game legitimately instead of checking safetynet they couldve easily checked for xposed framework on launch ala snapchat instead it still would suck that way but at least people who use open source after market firmwares would still be able to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,aaand thats why this is pointless they add root detection and people will create root detection blockers it might be more work to have hidden root right now but as more apps block root users the easier it will become to bypass
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep this is the end for me played since but wont unroot because of a single game or go through the headache of installing a work around that may not work after the next update anyway thanks for the final nail in my coffin niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre the one who rooted your phone you knew this would happen deal with it and stop whining
TheSilphRoad,removed,just gonna quit until i get a new phone and probably end up quitting for good because thats at least a couple of months away unfortunately my lg does not have bootloader unlocked official or not thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,its like rather than implementing any of the awesome features that have popped up in this sub theyve spent all their time teaching cheaters a lesson i mean how many saves do you think the niantic developers lost to missingno the cycle of hate never ends
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont forget to update your reviews on google play to star and to voice your opinion power users are not cheaters even if niantic doesnt give a damn about rooted users lets make some noise and give the app a bad reputation
TheSilphRoad,removed,this update is garbage im running a top of the line phone and just looking at level gyms will crash it every so often does anyone there test this stuff
TheSilphRoad,removed,since they are developers themselves i think they know it even better than every one else i suspect that they pretend to make things more secure to get more money from partnerships or this is an elaborate fieldtest for safetynet with a lot of determined attackers
TheSilphRoad,removed,well mission failed then cuz some guy was spoofing and following me around this morning there was no cars at any of the gyms i was doing on my usual run so unless hes superman he was still spoofing
TheSilphRoad,removed,uneedhername could you please give us more information that may be related how many zubat did you catch maybe its related to the zubat family in general how many poison types flying types did you get any new medals anything at all that might help ublounsbery i know youre trying to tell everyone that this doesnt work is false etc we come to silph road to note new information make sense of it and try to understand the stuff we dont understand i understand that our first try has failed here but we dont care whether the first or second or try was a failure we want to know what actually caused the stardust increase if you have nothing positive to say then feel free to skip this post and even this subreddit but if not then at the very least tell us your opinion and what you think makes more sense etc
TheSilphRoad,removed,meanwhile my coworker still uses his bot without trouble
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont cheat next time by rooting your phone and you wont run into this problem ever again
TheSilphRoad,removed,nope i blame niantic for having taken these shitty measures thats the easy way and they are only damaging the legit playerbase they are just cutting out of the game rooted users botters are mildly affected by this
TheSilphRoad,removed,because you touch yourself at night
TheSilphRoad,removed,there are bots that are still working httpwwwownedcorecomforumspokemongopokemongohackscheats
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed honestly the game is pretty shitty if you think about it and it just isnt worth dealing with that crap i guess if niantic wants to make even more people stop playing then they are getting what they want
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont want to have to pay rent just to live in silicon valley but you know what i have to or else i have to move elsewhere suck it up whiner
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh huawei if there is one brand which is called most when people say they cant run pogo its them srsly dunno why google hates them so much the conspiracy theorists who like drawing links between v will probably httpwwwiknowtodaycomhuaweibannedunitedstates to embellish their theories
TheSilphRoad,removed,magisk is easy to do but i agree im not playing this game anymore if im not welcome there if they do it like this i dont even want to play it its typically nintendo they just lost a well paying player
TheSilphRoad,removed,keep in mind theres still no actual tracking system in the game for an overwhelming majority of players personally id rather have people use them to keep the game alive whatever that means with a metagame this shallow than have them stop playing altogether i doubt the people who use such apps would even open the game much at all if there was no way of knowing where to find pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,more time wasted coding on cutesy graphics than fixing bugs that stupid oversized avatar can go too yes its new
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they dont change it im mad i have nest in town around a lake first it was machop then growlithe now its fking poliwag a pokemon thats spawning around the lake anyway and now they decided to take their time with changing the nestsor even keep it that way who knows niantic pls
TheSilphRoad,removed,i see one local pikachu nest appear to have gone scyther but not the other two local nests
TheSilphRoad,removed,op gets it niantic doesnt read this sub the sub that they might read is rpokemongo and even then what are the chances that they read your idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,was going to order two pokemon go pluses and root my phone this week guess i wont be buying those peripherals after all
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is for of the original playerbase hey who cares what the data says though
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah its a disaster just like the rest of this game the incompetence is incredible feel free to disagree ill just keep watching the userbase drop by day
TheSilphRoad,removed,see groupthink httpswwwwikiwandcomengroupthink
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously niantic im a legitimate user of a rooted device ive played since the first day ive never hacked or spoofed yet im being bundled into the same category unbelievable
TheSilphRoad,removed,god answered wrong god said that use stock rom unrooted
TheSilphRoad,removed,better remove my above post before more hate begins i have never brought a phone i get one roughly every months on a plan and this has always been sufficient for my phone usage even though i break them from time to time also there are some cheap phones out there that would run pokemon go fine borrow a family members im offering solutions the fact is people that are cheating ruin the game for other players this is evident in every game they ruin the economy etc same thing that happens in real life people make the problem then people need to try and fix it the world isnt perfect but hate away
TheSilphRoad,removed,were talking about a group of developers who couldnt manage a smooth release of a game that they already made once before
TheSilphRoad,removed,if it helps to fight gps spoofers then im all for it
TheSilphRoad,removed,welp i will no longer be spending money on pogo if they are going to be banning people for arbitrary reasons like roots cya guys
TheSilphRoad,removed,god damnit screw this no custom roms can play it pretty much
TheSilphRoad,removed,rooters finding ways to break more rules surprising
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for proving again that you are a brainless dumbass the tracking system is garbage legitimate players will get nothing out of this the only thing this does is help botters and spoofers get more candy but keep living in your tiny little box of a mind
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre not wrong but i still cant blame people for trying to find a workaround a lot of them have a completely legitimate account on a jailbroken phone and itd be a shame to lose it over something so unrelated to the game itself
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can spoof without rooting
TheSilphRoad,removed,its niantic dont ask questions or you might get banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,this comment needs more upvotes
TheSilphRoad,removed,so this is a workaround for spoofers aswell
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait so they directly deny rooted devices that sounds pretty damned lame rooting a device is the only real way to customize it how you like not to mention getting rid of all the bloatware that comes with andriod os as well as ios though ive never done the jailbreak thing i know bloat when i see it suddenly lag the crap out of my game for no reason at all and out of nowhere this seems like an approach at getting rid of botters but i have had an interest in rooting my device simply to change the stupid system font in android to something that supports more of the unicode that i prefer for my naming schema to change the system font you must root the device to get names where they can tell you about moveset stats size etc so that when you are building your team you have an objective outlook on what your arsenal can support if they would just make the build your team screen much more informative i wouldnt have to use the name field to make building a team easier i have to say i disagree with this approach botters are bad but customization is not i have been looking into rooting my device for a while but havent pulled the trigger on it because i am lazy however even beyond an easier naming scheme made possible using unifont or some other font that supports the specific characters that i want to use lies the simple fact that the device is mine and i should be allowed to do what i want with it extraneous to playing the game disallowing rooted devices is like banning colors of paint because some jerk with a car painted that color did a hit and run
TheSilphRoad,removed,have they fixed the tracker if so you are right
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracker fixed no then they still suck in fact they suck even more for having people work on new features while current features are broken niantic made my daughter cry screw them
TheSilphRoad,removed,this does nothing to block cheaters
TheSilphRoad,removed,trust me its always about money
TheSilphRoad,removed,still not playing until i get tracking havent touched it in spite
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres a free titanium pro apk
TheSilphRoad,removed,extremely lame its like steam saying you cant play this game if you have the admin password to your computer
TheSilphRoad,removed,and im stuck on the last version because my phone is rooted i hate niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i downloaded the game from the appstore i bought flipping pokecoins i never spoofed never even checked iv thanks for stopping me from playing you dbags i will be contacting my bank and asking for a charge back
TheSilphRoad,removed,guess this was a rooted phone comment seriously how dumb is niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont believe it something titled psa thats actually a psa thats not like reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,downvote for upvote for using pedantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,a very well thought out argument there buddy
TheSilphRoad,removed,this feature literally doesnt make sense why would you walk for one candy no wonder people cheat this game the amount of effort is no where near the reward
TheSilphRoad,removed,how you use that script
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i guess im done with pokemon go then because im not losing admin rights to my own damn hardware
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes actually i would in km i would probably be able to see the pokemon i have as a buddy anyway and get candies for it yet another trash unuseful feature from the fellas down at niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,just as i thought i failed come on niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,what about the freaking tracking and the catch bug fix
TheSilphRoad,removed,jumping through hoops just to play pokemon go can you imagine how this feels for people who have spent actual money on this game the end is near guys buckle up
TheSilphRoad,removed,rooted or jailbroken devices are not supported by pokémon go good wouldnt be against ar game developers outright banning rooted users going forward
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats not how refunds work
TheSilphRoad,removed,im a romming noob for the most part and while i think i could figure this out i dont see it being worth it i feel bitter towards niantic about it mostly i went out of my way not to cheat and get treated like one because my stock os was a nightmare and i upgraded my gf and dog will be devastated once im forced to update but hey at least my favorite fall activity nfl go is back
TheSilphRoad,removed,even if you unroot people are reporting it still blocks you from playing any remnants of a rooted phone and poof you gone niantic is brain dead i swear
TheSilphRoad,removed,the majority of cheaters do not use rooted phones root is the worst way to cheat bots run on computers and all real hacks require xposed anyway not all rooted users use xposed
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah more like you downgraded the game shame on you
TheSilphRoad,removed,because im going out for hours later and id like the buddy system for that instead of seeing it in the play store an hour after i get back home your sense of whats moral is so fuckin strict mate christ
TheSilphRoad,removed,tracking system fixedimproved gym error fixed egg hatching distance fixed gym sniping fixed pidgey iv bug fixed major update but no bug fix
TheSilphRoad,removed,so i decided to take one for the team and try it out i logged in on an android device selected pikachu as my buddy took some fumbling through menus until i found buddy option in profile screen menu next to journal and customize logged out relogged at the iphone installed a egg as my counter and started walking first data point no candies or exp at both were checked at and at eggometer no changes to be continued
TheSilphRoad,removed,great chart but these distances are absolutely ridiculous its hard enough even in big cities to find pokemon at least in germany and now they are putting the candies behind limits that are almost impossible to reach i say that because still doesnt correctly track the distance you walk to get distance in game you usually have to walk between and more in real life they shouldnt drown us in candy of course but some realistic limits would have been nice i find this rather disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,that has to be the dumbest thing ive ever read
TheSilphRoad,removed,makes sense we will probably only see one legendary in a month or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,hehe round trip to mars sounds like an oxymoron to me
TheSilphRoad,removed,cmon update just roll out for germany pls i rly wanna go on a walk but not without a working buddy i dont like wasting kilometers becasue of fucking slow niantic updates xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like how they decided to test it in the easiest place to catch any pokémon bleh
TheSilphRoad,removed,comments lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,what program do you use i thought they banned third party programs like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,this makes so little sense are businesses with a pokestop and wifi going to only allow user connection
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously its basically the only way kids can play the game without ridiculously buying your year old son an expensive phone and data plan just to play and they get so much fun and amazement from it seems wrong to take that away plus you know its based off ofpossibly is a childs game
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been trying to figure out how to do this with an old smart phone and my ipad keeps saying gps signal not found any tips for people who want to tether services for their kids
TheSilphRoad,removed,first
TheSilphRoad,removed,i bought my device rooted and dont see why its such a big deal that it is theyre going to lose a lot more of their userbase with all these needless restrictions
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes its posted by niantic inc they post the apk because they know it takes a while for apps and updates to process through the play store
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wonder if i should spoil it for you all or not
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really hope this isnt the case my uses my old bricked iphone to play connects via the hotspot on either me or my iphones im not purchasing a new smartphone data plan solely for her to play pogo but we cant exactly go out on family pokemon hunting excursions if the youngest most temperamental member of the family cant participate ive stuck with pogo through the server issues bugs glitches tracking fiasco etc but this alone would be enough to make my entire family quit im sure a lot of families would feel the same i hope this is an error if not niantic has just lost more players
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep no advertisement have fun getting banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,i like sexy slim girls too but hey stop insulting fat pokémon
TheSilphRoad,removed,op asks for others to post location doesnt post his location lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,omg did niantic try to destroy their own product no rooted phones no multi acc wifi access
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh i expected an egg to hatch
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have not done any formal testing but i had lots of connection issues since and this would explain it given that a family may share the same mifi or the same broadband line this seems like an incredibly antisocial move i also had lots of crashes with the new version to the point that mid range devices moto g nexus are getting unplayable i am not impressed and i think niantic is losing the plot
TheSilphRoad,removed,have fun getting the ban hammer lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,if it is this that they are mentioning and its the only one i will be pissed it adds nothing
TheSilphRoad,removed,i totally agree with you on this meta nonsense lets stop kidding ourselves this game is a not complex enough to have what any real gamer should call a metagame honestly its just put your strongest snorlax in gym and b lacks any real competitive angle to it beyond the pseudo pvevp gym system which isnt really competitive unless npc battle racing is your idea of hardcore multiplayer gaming this game is casual city there is no metagame until real pvp battling andor some kind of ladder system is implemented just get over the fact that not every game requires obsessive analysis the skill ceiling is laughably low and i find it apalling so many players cant even figure out the dodge system its literally game breaking how powerful knowing how dodge works changes the gym gameplay
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that is unbelievably underwhelming
TheSilphRoad,removed,the eevee trick was at least useful even if only once and that was an easter egg im not saying that they all have to be gamechanging or even useful but in this case where someone went through the trouble of giving out a hint to tsr youd think itd be something of note
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow this turned in to the exact opposite of the stated thread title can we shut up about not having the update and only report when it actually shows up in the app stores please theres already threads for not having it
TheSilphRoad,removed,complete junk spend that money on more useful things like more pokecoins
TheSilphRoad,removed,i choose to not believe that it is i really hope so that it is not that would be extremelly dissapointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,so something interesting happened when i tried updated like this the app tells my that my device or operating system is not compatible with pokemon go im rooted on an lg tribute ii so i disabled root and verified that through got root app still no dice so either the play storeniantic is detecting that the update has not rolled out for me orthey are leaving less powerful phones in the dust
TheSilphRoad,removed,that makes zero sense sure that might happen in politics but were talking about a pokemon phone game here
TheSilphRoad,removed,not gonna lie if thats the easter egg im severely disappointedi could care less one way or another if i have an electric rat on my shoulderlol
TheSilphRoad,removed,dunno looks kinda photoshopped thought they would do a better job in getting the character to look correct weird tilt at the moment
TheSilphRoad,removed,possibly but its already been discovered that some mons ride on your shoulder in the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,so tired of the constant digital masturbation pikachu gets
TheSilphRoad,removed,great app i can even see what attacks the defenders have
TheSilphRoad,removed,use a specific pokemon go account dont use your main account you could be banned the notification shows you your current gyms with the information you need it shows you gym on the map and if you click on a gym it will show you all the informations current level prestige points owner list of pokemon with their special moves when you scan your area using long click on the map or clicking on the refresh icon it will download existing cloud data about the gyms on the area shown on map dont try on too big area i have to fix a memory issue it will start scanning the nearby gyms using the ptc account you gave to update the information this updated information is uploaded on cloud to be available to other users
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup people suggesting apk downloaders get banned lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,so a minor easter egg that the internet has discovered before anybody actually got the legit app update through the marketplace or app store super lame
TheSilphRoad,removed,possibility of ios build
TheSilphRoad,removed,i didnt make this app to cheat but to make the game even better to play my app is able to show you pokemon around you too but i chose not to enable this feature im not showing all available information im hiding the pokemon iv for example whereas i could show them but i dont want to make this app a cheater app but being able to monitor your gyms and know if you are still in them is so much more fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you want free karma like op it sure is
TheSilphRoad,removed,i knew it would be something lame like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,it looks really awkwardly positioned on the shoulder
TheSilphRoad,removed,no what stops it from being an easter egg is the fact it happens automatically thats like the easter bunny walking up to you and handing you an egg easter eggs are little secrets that make you smile when you go out of your way to find them
TheSilphRoad,removed,is this the full easter egg i was hoping for some sort of beneficial thing like ditto
TheSilphRoad,removed,fixing why cant it be female
TheSilphRoad,removed,if that one about pokemon fleeing outside their radius is true then that really sucks basically destroys catching anything while riding as a passenger probably the intent but it also makes it a lot more inconvenient in general when it rains i often run up my street click a pokemon then go back to my house to catch it now im gonna have to stand in the rain and get myself and my phone soaked umbrellas only do so much
TheSilphRoad,removed,how dare you assume raichus gender just because there is evidence of a penis
TheSilphRoad,removed,sightings already at pokiegocom im excited for silphs trading but im not sure why silph would bother with mapping when this map already has so much more data and is open to every tester
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,if u dont pick a team youre not interested in battling and if youre not interested in battling u dont need to know ivs owowowow my brain saying youre waiting for dueling isnt a valid excuse either because maybe that hasnt even been rumored at being added yet sigh and theres no rumour the other way that there wont be individual or nonteam battling yet youve certainly made up your mind that we should judge people by the game right now and everything is set in stone except niantic cannot help themselves changing literally any and everything
TheSilphRoad,removed,you mean other than the one thats been linked to times as first comments to similar questions on this subreddit in the last hours
TheSilphRoad,removed,he was with his girlfriend
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyone else did
TheSilphRoad,removed,what site or app is that
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry but thats not fair you win against pkmn and get less presxp cool word creation mh than defeating one with some weaker its okay to get a good amount of presxp if you win against one with a weaker one i dont mean that this is bs but if you defeat or more you should get at least the same amount and this is what i mean make it better to train
TheSilphRoad,removed,why is this funny
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,of the posts on this sub lately are just people asking stupid questions
TheSilphRoad,removed,no nest change thus far has resulted in rares appearing in regular spawn points you mean all of them thats not exactly a healthy sample size for using as a baseline
TheSilphRoad,removed,search the sticky post for newest commentssearch like out that they are working on some bug fixes and will release within this week dont act like this is hard to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,or just do some research on your own and you can come up with an answer yourself rip their inboxes because of lazy people
TheSilphRoad,removed,false
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah that wtf was definitely not rude it was just direct
TheSilphRoad,removed,only if theres at least between levels otherwise it might be trying to interpret rounded data
TheSilphRoad,removed,i posted it my gripes alone wont be enough i suspect
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly i hope they change it when they will release it to everyone because as it is this beta tracker its pretty lackluster and not very engaging which is even worse than lackluster
TheSilphRoad,removed,in the early days of the game pidgeot was the shit mostly because it was the best pokemon you can get for cheap
TheSilphRoad,removed,because why should niantics site be compatible with chrome even though its consistently the mostused browser worldwide
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am not sure maybe this rattata is possible with the bug it is rattatas pokedexbugged attack iv range is from all my sampling proof here the starters are interesting though
TheSilphRoad,removed,one thing i learned because my cellphone touch screen really sucks is to do this steps really fast touch your finger on the lower part of the screen to grab the pokeball move it really fast up down up release the ball done it will reach as far as it can
TheSilphRoad,removed,d this is hilarious is the apologetic persona giving you more clicks dunno if im speaking to an actual person at this point
TheSilphRoad,removed,what to me it seems like youre the one who isnt making any sense
TheSilphRoad,removed,upvoting because this is the truth pogohub used to be awful now i check it regularly
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,normal data usage for me in hour play session is at most yesterday was really hating niantic right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,this update is idiotic
TheSilphRoad,removed,hmmmit seems jerky to me now and the whole pokeball thingif you dont stand still in the direction you are facing when you threw the ballif you move at allthe game seems to pause its really really stupid
TheSilphRoad,removed,seems to be awful on my nexus running android start up with nothing else running and freshly restarted phone goes like this right now seconds black screen seconds niantic screen seconds loading screen scrolling list of pokemon is slow as shit havent had a chance to catch any to see issues with that
TheSilphRoad,removed,but theyre confirmed bro
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am not spending more money until some kind of tracker exists but i have to admit this is tempting
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was really excited about this event until the update made it impossible to catch pokémon half the time and made my plus nonfunctional time to delete this game i guess
TheSilphRoad,removed,i will put it easy for you buy some lucky eggs buddy with a pidgey caterpie weedle whatever is most common for you and grind you are xp away from level level level to put it simply you are going to be kicking yourself when you get to level and need just to get to level use this time to catch buddy and hatch as many candies as you can get enough evo fodder to utilize lucky eggs and blow through some levels you could probably easily if you do it right get to level then once you get to your cp cap goes up you find higher cp wild pokémon and bam you catch a eevee you evolve it into a vape which blows your vape out of the water and you havent spent any dust in the process
TheSilphRoad,removed,it looks amazingbut i dont think the graphics and text are the reason people are leaving the gameill still play pokemon on red and bluegive me a better tracking system more to do with buddies the egg situation ect
TheSilphRoad,removed,same thing happened to me im into distance to next candy and i was just randomly given one when i opened the app
TheSilphRoad,removed,feel sorry about you bro i just caught a hastily and it turned out to be a dragonite
TheSilphRoad,removed,noticed this on fast pokemap in downtown toronto none locally yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been looking at my sightings and i saw this so i checked with my fairly polite mate and it looks like this is happening everywhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,barely playing the game its barely got gameplay and it eats half my free time if their goal is literally hours a day for infinity they need to start putting actual content in and also accept that theyre going to shrink to more like players im at level right now which im pretty sure puts me somewhere around the top of players if not higher well aware that there are people doing hours a day but that group is incredibly rare how much time do you think you should need to catch one of each pokémon before they dump more in hours a day its a game to play on your phone while youre walking around its not supposed to be the center of your existence
TheSilphRoad,removed,its called pokemon go the key word being go as in go outside go for a walk or go complain about a free to play game that you are voluntarily playing elsewhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,you sir are a retard
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think this user is lamenting that the community decided to downvote confident yesno replies in favor of the much more flexible maybe reply maybe theyre looking for clear cut answers despite us not having all the necessary information to reply using one of both with enough confidence and data to back them up theyre stating their observation mostly and snarkily
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes but how will you share it if its not upvoted
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont understand why people say dont upvote in their posts
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre not the boss of me now and youre not so big
TheSilphRoad,removed,you could try turning wifi off at different times of the day to see if you drift a different direction
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont tell me how to vote
TheSilphRoad,removed,so you feel that being a passive investor in a sinking stock is a good thing nintendo surged on pokemon go due to the increased exposure and expectation of gains from in app purchase this was a nice wave of momentum that pushed it up billions in a matter of weeks that was until investors found out that nintendo will not be making the amount investors expect from this game look what happened after the initial buy in phase the stock came back to earth if you were a investor that didnt sell you missed out on all gains only to hold on to the minimal dividend the stock yields yearly who the hell wants to invest in a company that does not make money is losing money every year and has no true direction anything that is built on momentum of users will never truly be valued properly look at twitter where they drew millions of users but failed to profit on them to satisfy the taste of investors this is the same thing as pokemon yes you had millions of players but how many players actually spent money on the game just to buy into the moment now you take into account the attrition of losing of your users who have spent money initially and you are left with your hardcore players in what world would you want to lose of your user base who will not spend another dime
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we not let this sub turn into a second rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,brazil a big historical city surrounded by mountains and we have open sewersalso some lakes but no sea at all aerodactyl spawns several times a day i got yesterday also dragonite is less rare than dragonair i dont understanddrowzeevoltorbsseeldoduo are uber rares
TheSilphRoad,removed,its for science of course
TheSilphRoad,removed,so it is against tos but log off for a day appropriate travel time have friend log in and catch whatever have them logged off for a decent amount of time before you play dont have your friend log in while in japan minutes after you were logged in while in nyc
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow ill definitely give that a try under my bed i think
TheSilphRoad,removed,you dont need to amuse me since you have no prior knowledge of whom i was referring to so do me a favor and eat a big one second of all investors were investing in nintendo so in case you want me to dumb it down for you they were trading or holding nintendo stock your ignorance shows me assumed niantic had shares to trade makes sense a noob like you prob team instinct would succumb to this again you are answering a post you werent a part of and you can down vote me all you want because at the end of the day reddit isnt life and you still dont a lapras nor a snorlax maybe you can wish for one
TheSilphRoad,removed,pm blaze up
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive seen at least one post asking this here every day since the new atlas launched they seriously need a faq somewhere it will be soon
TheSilphRoad,removed,an illegal app that cheaters use it drains niantic servers essentially a ddos attack ruining the game for everyone else just so some year olds know where to gps spoof and send their bots so they can make a reddit post bragging about their bots filling their regional pokedex
TheSilphRoad,removed,you could have done all that plus more in the time it took you to write your comment lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,you could also follow the on screen instruction to understand how the map works
TheSilphRoad,removed,what scanner
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh no the same things you describe were in the sign up for me sorry i didnt realize that was the part you meant i just meant that i didnt see any information on the website regarding whether you can view all the pokemon around your area at once you cant right now but theyre working on it whether you should be able to see more information if you click right on a pin with nests you should with sightings you should not at least if im understanding correctly the fact that in order to view the map at all you must first click on a pokemon picture i figured it out pretty quickly by just trying it to see what would happen those things were what i was talking about though sorry
TheSilphRoad,removed,well dont wild caught starters always come with shit attack iv due to the low pokedex bug i only catch them for candies already knowing their ivs will be crap still waiting to hatch a good squirtle and a charmander since thats the only way to get good ones
TheSilphRoad,removed,any park bione on osm is a nest for rare pokemon where on earth did you get this idea this is easily disproven in one park for example you yourself just said there are park biomes with zero spawnpoint youre coming to conclusions that your own limited data does not even properly support and even if you mean every park with a spawnpoint is a nest youre already seeing plenty of anecdotal evidence this is wrong ive got plenty myself and im sure youll see more coming in future comments
TheSilphRoad,removed,ya fkn wanka
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for your obnoxiously long comment instead of just using some intuition and basic reasoning
TheSilphRoad,removed,dyslexia retarded dont try to sugar coat it and make yourself sound any less handicapped lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,have you been living in a cave for the last couple of weeks
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use an app called pokemesh on android yeah earlham park is a sycther spawn now get at least an hour once or twice a day hours a snorlax lapras or dragonite appear too i caught my first lapras on campus
TheSilphRoad,removed,no you havent but you can feel free to prove it to yourself by trying to take a screenshot
TheSilphRoad,removed,you upload it to imgur and then post the link
TheSilphRoad,removed,this guys right
TheSilphRoad,removed,this one
TheSilphRoad,removed,how long does it show for
TheSilphRoad,removed,you must not play smash at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,at least iwata steve jobs and robin williams can be together wherever insert religion of choice would have them
TheSilphRoad,removed,this explains why niantic cant submit a quality line of code to save their life
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry you mean harambe
TheSilphRoad,removed,higher cp lower dust cost to power up this basically means its a lower level and has more room to grow is what you want when comparing mons the hp of the mons will roughly indicate its stamina stat too
TheSilphRoad,removed,i used pokeadvisor quite a bit even though almost all my pokemon sucked ivwise i also run livemapgo and pokealert neither logged in with my main account my main account is fine no issues the sub accounts for the maps are also ok but its only a matter of time before they get thrown to a ban
TheSilphRoad,removed,called player is a fucking hacking asshole bug banwave coming
TheSilphRoad,removed,please dont tie his name to pokemon go had he been alive at its release he would have been disgusted by it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wonder if hes in heaven like what the ninatic no ing tracking system you s and youre sending cease and desist orders minortextupdates thats it s im going to reincarnate to give you one star ratings in the app store
TheSilphRoad,removed,theyve rerouted me into friendster
TheSilphRoad,removed,would love a code
TheSilphRoad,removed,where can i find the codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,and the code iswait for it
TheSilphRoad,removed,panic
TheSilphRoad,removed,mins late
TheSilphRoad,removed,the codes tho

TheSilphRoad,removed,im here its edt am i too late or is there no update yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,its desconsiderated for the ones that showed up at the required time
TheSilphRoad,removed,minutes now tick tock
TheSilphRoad,removed,you shouldnt do code drops at specific times if you cant wake up in time to post them rude
TheSilphRoad,removed,please bawse can i hava da code please
TheSilphRoad,removed,where do we see all the codes when they do pop up please help i dont want to miss the drop
TheSilphRoad,removed,the code is
TheSilphRoad,removed,there is no codes updated its very early in the morning here i woke up and till now no codes asia
TheSilphRoad,removed,in my haste i authenticated but the window is only i hope i dont get the code only to find out i have to authorise the app again
TheSilphRoad,removed,its
TheSilphRoad,removed,did niantic get them
TheSilphRoad,removed,pls dont do this to me
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is unbelievable you can be damn sure the silph road is going to keep trying to be the best doin great team
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is onixcceptableim sorry
TheSilphRoad,removed,george soros probably had something to do with this
TheSilphRoad,removed,you guys are kind of ruining my day
TheSilphRoad,removed,wheres the code fam
TheSilphRoad,removed,surelyopwilldeliverpng
TheSilphRoad,removed,minutes of refreshing sure is boring
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i hope it will be possible to sign up shame we have no news as to whats going on
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpimgurcomgallerywjhal
TheSilphRoad,removed,pls im tired gimme my fuckin code already
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont go down and read the comments when the codes come out they will be used up before you have refreshed again o
TheSilphRoad,removed,there was a delay like this the last time a code was given
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi
TheSilphRoad,removed,i can haz le code
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,buying gf
TheSilphRoad,removed,well that was productive s are the tools on the site really that great comparable tools available from a less restrictive source
TheSilphRoad,removed,this thread is giving me ptsd from the frank ocean thread on rhhh
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe he meant edt lul
TheSilphRoad,removed,half hour gimme codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,sure hope nothing bad has happened
TheSilphRoad,removed,help i need the access help you know i need the access help give me the access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe this is all an elaborate scheme to boost the threads google rankings by increasing the traffic via repeated reloading or something
TheSilphRoad,removed,delayed by more than one train in eastern europe
TheSilphRoad,removed,my code was
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,got in thank you
TheSilphRoad,removed,u mad bro
TheSilphRoad,removed,confirmed this is true i scanned a few well known nests in my city and a lot of them had ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,its definitely cheating but it is interesting to setup and gamebreaking in terms of how many top tier mons can be caught each day if its possible people will do it and it doesnt directly affect the gameplay of others but definiely gives an edge also the tracking system hasnt returned to its previous high at release yet which has only fueled interest in scanning
TheSilphRoad,removed,can you link the source for that first pokedex complete guy using scanners i have used scanners religiously to get to and enjoyed it massively video game accomplishment is a huge drive for me i have participated in and public easteregg hunts and this is the new one that took my interest i walked around my cities sports arena for two hours one night after my nightschool after work because it was a dratini nest this took so much time and gave me a heap of candy but low iv dratini so when i setup my own scanner and caught a dragonite before i had a dragonair i was stoked ive only just recently got but without scanning i would still be there scanning has made it much easier and stopped me wasting candy on bad iv mons i definitely wouldnt have dnites and snorlax though snorlax is probably the one i wouldnt have if i didnt use any tracking sites due to not being able to evolve and never seeing on the nearby the other hard to find single stage mons i have hatched eg lapras and chansey ive spent on the game i also enjoy helping other people with my scanner or directing them to other scanners so when they catch something they feel a sense of accomplishment it is much harder for rural and suburban players to see a wide variety also what is the silph roads take on other people telling someone where a current spawned rare is it is still cheating and means that person hasnt had to do anywork to get that mon using a scanner still means i have to drive or walk very occasionally to get them i definitely see the otherside to it but its not killing the game in a lot of ways it creates more interest
TheSilphRoad,removed,bwahaha good luck with that i always get downvoted to oblivion when i point this out
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill never understand why some people are so bothered by how others play the game theres no actual pvp and even if there ever is the pokemon economy is already ruined what with every other person having an army of dragonites and snorlaxes it just comes across as so petty to get wound up about people using scanners it doesnt affect you at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,so why in the oblivion would they take out a feature they already had in the game just to reinstate it further down the road i understand the server overload and all that but it ismt worth its own update throw it into or do something larger with the update wtw
TheSilphRoad,removed,where i live you just have to know the areas where the teams are dominant one suburb over there is a distinct instinct dominant area lvl gyms with cp as the spot further south is a valour dominant area with similar high cps at the spot my suburb and some surrounding areas are mystic all areas have well more than gyms per team its become a competition against your own team not to have your exeggcutes dropping out of ive switch my focus to dragonites for that reason
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsmapkpurecompokemongocomnianticlabspokemongo just downloaded and installed its working doesnt always show the city name tho on a side note pokémon flee rate increased ultra balls drop less often i just found more eggs than ever before rare spawns increased and egg distance tracking is more accurate jk p
TheSilphRoad,removed,every two weeks i get my hopes up that gym balance may be coming only to be disappointed maybe the minor bug fixes include the gym lockout bug maybe please
TheSilphRoad,removed,and apk
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow this is so bad seeing name of the city where you caught pokemon is useless also why we need to download another mb update which is basically pogo content and fixes only
TheSilphRoad,removed,this update is extremely lackluster
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank goodness that map thing is coming back
TheSilphRoad,removed,meh it only shows the city not the real location
TheSilphRoad,removed,would we love it folks headed out to local parks to scout out nests as an outdoor adventure on a saturday how many times have i told everyone not all parks have nests not even all parks have spawns at all and yes they are correctly marked in osm now please stop spreading that misinformation i also asked niantic to change their faq page that states this but i dont think they did neither did they add spawn points in our parks i have also never seen a nest at all just those spawn points usually single sometimes and one even has but mind you even the spawn points are very specific the spawn points in between them do not spawn the pokemon but those arent defined as nests under any explanation of the term ive ever read i was even shocked when someone made a map of all nests and spawn points in their city wow i really havent ever seen anything like a nest before that looked ridiculous
TheSilphRoad,removed,pgnexus
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know you wont get banned for it as ive been using it for months i was making a counterpoint he said anything that needs access to his account is a sure fire way to get banned which is false
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been running a map with ivs for a small city for a few days ive made a graph of the mean value of the individual attack value of both the situation before and after the means are plotted with a confidence interval my results would suggest that the bug is fixed httpimgurcomaochvb
TheSilphRoad,removed,im loading my pogo map and checking the local poliwag nest to see if anything changed brb
TheSilphRoad,removed,just like pokemon not fainting after being kicked out of a gym was working as intended just like attack iv distribution being heavily skewed for certain species was working as intended just because something exists in the game and has not been discussed or addressed does not mean its working as a bug niantic is basically acting like the cia of game developers never give up any information and deny deny deny
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes this game should have a working tracker feature no wow
TheSilphRoad,removed,agreed now everything gets to be a shitty or less iv pokemon now eggs are the only option for higher ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry but any time wow is mentioned i throw up in my mouth just a little
TheSilphRoad,removed,i bet theres some way to get that pid out of a packet capture and not just a bot either way it seemed like an intrinsic part of pokemon just like ivs if data derived from datamining were to be banned this forum would look like niantics twitter
TheSilphRoad,removed,also wondering where in nc please say raleigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,idiot
TheSilphRoad,removed,probably fastpoke scanning many more people know about it now then say last week but yeah ive always found snorlax in pairs or so when they do spawn on said day there was a post here not long ago with someone showing their snorlax trackinghunting since game release and said the vast majority of the time they would spawn every hour or so and migrate a few blocks at a time then go dry for nearly a week and repeat the following
TheSilphRoad,removed,nice attitude
TheSilphRoad,removed,i also just tested catching a starter pokemon on a new account and my bulbasaurs ivs are exactly according to pokenurse which pulls the data out from the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i name mine way easier than screenshots
TheSilphRoad,removed,it would have bothered me a lot less some other dude wants to walk out to a gym in the middle of a field in the rain and is lucky enough to get there at exactly the right time gotta give credit where its due that guy is dedicated
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a really stupid idea they should make max cp of pokemon much closer than it is right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,jesus christ what kind of spaghetti code leads to nonsense like this its obviously reusing variables but god damn
TheSilphRoad,removed,currently unown i think youll still need the normal amount of candies with the addition of one evolution item
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a casual lurker i want to say this is too much its a game its not that important im out good luck with your issue
TheSilphRoad,removed,trading is in the code but inactive fuckin bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,where do these people come from this sub used to be chill
TheSilphRoad,removed,this fucking game man i understand ive only ever seen two eggs ive caught i drove an hour to a large town today and the only new one i caught was a dratini we spent four hours driving around i had to throw out all my pokeballs to make room for great and ultra balls
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is absolutely horrible and literally unplayable if they let this persist until next update
TheSilphRoad,removed,your english is not failing you niantic speaks in a strange dialect known as hankenese its kind of like i am groot but none of us even comes close to rocket racoon while were not sure it seems hankenese involves making really ambiguous statements like additional ingame content will become available without even mentioning if it will just happen in davos in the world or in john hankes toilet
TheSilphRoad,removed,minutes here of ram and power saving mode what a bloated piece of poor software engineering
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a bunch of faguettes
TheSilphRoad,removed,underrated comment
TheSilphRoad,removed,am i the only one that thinks this should be a standard in most companies and its nothing special
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this app still has the obnoxious warnings every minutes about not playing while driving im leaving another star rating for it in the app store
TheSilphRoad,removed,is there a way to add retention ponds and stuff to this map my subdivision has one really big pond and a bunch of smaller ones they dont show up on openstreetmaps and they dont show up on the in game map either but they are there on google maps
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,r
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean under this same logic you should try to take legal action against clash of clans because kate upton isnt bouncing her boobs in your living room when you play the game is free and doesnt require any purchases to play so stop complaining and if you dont like it stop playing they didnt promise anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,exactly another example i saw recently was when cory booker and a few other democrats blocked the amendment sanders put forward in regards to importing cheaper drugs people defended booker blocking it saying he did so because a lot of the people he represents work in the pharmaceutical industry so he had to protect them they basically said he is justified to put the needs of his constituents ahead of the needs of the country as a whole because cheaper drugs will benefit all americans but will lead to some of his constituents being let go from their jobs now can you imagine these same people defending a republican candidate who puts the need of their constituents who work in the oil industry for example ahead of the need of the country to combat climate change no chance in hell one rule for their side and another rule for the other edit i am not agreeing or disagreeing with what booker did i am pointing out that some people will justify his actions but attack others for doing something similar also it was a nonbinding vote but in the thread a lot of people were under the influence it was blocked from becoming a law so the point still stands
TheSilphRoad,removed,will do if i ever encounter dragonite again lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok so varying success sometimes it doesnt connect first time just let it time out and try again if it doesnt work when you unpair it then things get hard today mine stopped twice and the way i got it to connect again was go to pokemon go plus page in settings eject the go press the button on the go sometimes it will then immediately appear then you are good if not then you need to keep doing it do not reset it this made things worse for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,only if you tone being fag down random only if you tone it down
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you run a pokemongo map with webhooks you can get a pretty good alert system
TheSilphRoad,removed,i will enjoy my game even more when wusses like you will quit also we have the silph road atlas made without thirdparty scanners and without putting additional pressure on the servers the game itself might even start lagging less when all of those will stop working unfortunately so far they keep working as if nothing happened
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe you should ask uwhitelistip if he knows at least he has access to the perfect data for the job
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been working on a mysql query that can filter sightings data and leave you with what are nest points the only step remaining is to do a secondary check for osm boundaries in order to eliminate the common species problem i would love to incorporate this into my map results wwwmanijuanascomviznestmaphtml
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey i run about cities in denmark when i update my servers later i will point to your webhook includes slagelse roskilde aarhus herning korsør svenstrup inner copenhagen amager copenhagen httppokespotseu
TheSilphRoad,removed,nuuh maybe they want to masturbate in the bushes that would be totally fine
TheSilphRoad,removed,i honestly cant believe that everybody me included obviously pay so much attention to an app that has so many bugs crashes etc im a developer so in my mind i cant understand how someone ehem niantic can put a product like this out to the public but hey were still here playing it for hours everyday weve been brain washed
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes in an hour of playtime yesterday i crashed times also i popped an incense while walking and encountered rattatas in a row of which fled then finally i ran across a bulbasaur used ultra balls and razz berries to catch it it is appraised as above average next a cp pidgey excellent throw with a regular ball and it escaped and fled i uninstalled there is nothing at all good about his game once you get over the novelty adios and good luck all
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously i cant click on a level gym without crashing its unreal how poorly this game functions especially since the last update
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here in this video u can see the dude showing the changes but he dosent link it
TheSilphRoad,removed,its not that hard obviously you cant recreate the whole scenario with testing and some bugs and bad coding will make the cut but its not impossible i think its just a matter of which are your goals here make a good game have fun doing it bring fun to the people and obviously make some money out of it or just simply try to make money without even care what youre doing for your own audience
TheSilphRoad,removed,how can this slip past testing and qa its not like they were adding features so rapidly that they can not do proper testing im past disappointed in niantics ability to develop a game of that scale
TheSilphRoad,removed,go for it they will have a good laugh dont forget to mention the unboxing video
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats not south texas
TheSilphRoad,removed,you clearly havent written a program before when you fix one thing something that you think is completely unrelated is affected and gets screwed up its extremely difficult to make a game that updates perfectly on such a wide variety of devices
TheSilphRoad,removed,give up and spend the time learning things like spelling grammar punctuation
TheSilphRoad,removed,this would be too cool niantic doesnt like cool things
TheSilphRoad,removed,two scenarios putting wiggly into a full gym or a growing gym in a full gym while it is a really good pokemon it is very likely to be on or near the bottom due to its bad cp this means it will be kicked out pretty quickly and while it will do good in the battles it has it wont have as many battles in which to shine during a prolonged gym attack in a gym which is still growing you get this problem along with a much larger downside if wiggly is on the bottom of the gym it will be so hard to train against that most people might say fuck it and then wiggly just cock blocked your gym growing any more wiggly would be great for training gyms due to its low cp
TheSilphRoad,removed,it s a known fact that tauros spawns in tx it was about it not spawning in s texas florida
TheSilphRoad,removed,a memory leak what language did they use to program the app as far as i know memory leaks arent possible in java and im sure the same is true with swift did they use something as ancient as c or is there something they didnt tell me in intro to programming about memory leaks
TheSilphRoad,removed,there were threads about the movement buffering that now takes place when the new version initially came along in my case it causes oodles of problems and solves none sadly
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokestumble scanner for pokemon pokestops and gyms its shitty scanner for mons but for gyms its just perfect shows the holder prestige and you can check for stops nearby to refill if needed
TheSilphRoad,removed,youve got it backwards if you think your post being downvoted at rpokemongo means you should post it here instead
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes this already exists go to rpokemongodev
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously
TheSilphRoad,removed,til sky is blue
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is on front page lmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,fym nigga u never play pokemon before 😤😤💯💯😂😂😂🔫🔫😵😵
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have victreebels with razor leafsolar beam and with razor leafleaf blade that i regularly put into gyms theyre all over cp and solid counters to all the vaporeons i still see around here your victreebel is a contender but youll have to throw a lot of stardust at it to make it topnotch at this point it could challenge weak vaporeon or other water types
TheSilphRoad,removed,since this would be cheating none of these appswebsites
TheSilphRoad,removed,my best luck was with the desktop pc app with mobile feature after the ban wave i stopped using it and my mapping account finally got banned a couple weeks ago so make sure you dont use your main account it may also be wise to use vpnproxies though i did not get my ip banned the problem with the majority of the phone maps is that they use the data derived from botters and the like so if those folks arent scanning your more rural area such apps will be useless theyre generally rather poor where i live in the suburbs but not bad for our major downtown area theyre quite good for major cities so ill be mainly making use of them on an upcoming trip to the bay area
TheSilphRoad,removed,illuminati confirmed
TheSilphRoad,removed,awesome bot
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive evolved for three and caught one in the wild without getting pjeq i actually have a list of all the shot movesets ive gotten
TheSilphRoad,removed,winter game plans not beeing a pussy and cat come pokemon in the snow
TheSilphRoad,removed,the spawns indirectly outside my house are trash i keep pokemesh open whenever im in normally sends me minutes in any given direction for the mons
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude dont be dumb niantic rotates spawns
TheSilphRoad,removed,that info can be found on pokesnipcom also but i can see the issue you are stating
TheSilphRoad,removed,a trick for freeway capturing not so much for incense is to turn off your gps when the fight starts the game wont know that youre too far from the pokémon to trigger the auto flee and then turn it back on after the gotcha
TheSilphRoad,removed,same just happend to me and i was going to make a post just like yours i asked for a refound fyi
TheSilphRoad,removed,let me correct myself if you tap on a pokemon then get on the highway you can catch it quickly but if youre already on the highway and tap on a pokemon until you slow down again hes going to flee
TheSilphRoad,removed,what programms did you use for this any chance you can make a map for augsburg ill definitely use this next time im coming over to munich
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you serious if they put captchas in this game i will probably stop playing i catch more than five all the time and i hate having to do captchas its a huge inconvenience and would probably stop people from being able to grab something that could despawn in seconds
TheSilphRoad,removed,go figure you guys get the royal treatment while us suburbs and rurals get garbage
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic screwing things up and ignoring their playerbase circa
TheSilphRoad,removed,is there a list being maintained of local scanners
TheSilphRoad,removed,well i mr hanke you just shut down one of my favorate trackers i used them to find nest and rare p mons i m tired of catching rats and pigs i have tons of evee s now at level its getting boring now how will i find my friend mr snorlax it usually takes me min to get in the area where they spawned so does not give me much time to catch them uaually spawn in the next city from where i live none in my area so now its like finding a needle in a hay stack i do better fishing in the ocean at least there i know where i can catch certain fish
TheSilphRoad,removed,goodbye sweet you will be missed
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry to tell you the customer is not actually king especially if they act like a entitled douche
TheSilphRoad,removed,get a job
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually came here to say the same thing
TheSilphRoad,removed,ffs stop putting hypnos in gyms they land at the bottom and are a nightmare to train up
TheSilphRoad,removed,we had exactly one nest where i live they changed it from scyther to freaking caterpie thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,you cannot see any nicknames except yours oh the other hand
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,reminder tauros north america mr mime western europe farfetchd japan kangashkan australia now just look at a map and youll se how stupid your question is
TheSilphRoad,removed,had a poke through the code i believe here are the combinations var loadingmessages
TheSilphRoad,removed,trainer tips how tos this like that
TheSilphRoad,removed,let me check my tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think its actually less than i had a dragonair that evolved into a dragonite i dont remember exactly the cp
TheSilphRoad,removed,such old news
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not sure but i just tested fastpokemaps and it showed nothing at my current location even after reloading several times on pokemon go i have three drowzee and a zubat flapping around with a few more on my nearby im not sure what happened yesterday besides the migration but it definitely affected trackers seems to have been a major security update
TheSilphRoad,removed,so in short quantity over quality the more players a team has the more can and will train those gyms as soon as this system goes live instinct is fucked at the moment a few hardcore instinct players can stand their ground against the other teams since of them are not that active and therefor dont have the time and potions or even high enough attackers to train their gyms with the new system everyone can train anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,it hasnt even been six months weve already gotten the buddy system finally gotten a good gym balance and now we have the first wave of gen ii pokemon the waah niantic gimme circlejerk in this sub is pretty irritating stop playing the game if it pains you so much not to get your every whim
TheSilphRoad,removed,that was one hell of a wall of text to say million catches a day with a in probability of a shiny that is pokemon a day it will be immediately apparent on this sub as soon as they are released
TheSilphRoad,removed,party tracker in a decent sized city
TheSilphRoad,removed,hahahaha you think those people read other threads youre funny
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsthesilphroadcomsciencepokestopeggdropdistancedistribution
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only working scanners require people to create a lot of dummy accounts and those accounts trigger captchas the captchas in turn create ip address blocks if you get enough of them i dont have any strong feelings about scanners either way i used fpm back when it was working but mainly to verify nests during switches i have tried a couple of the new scanners since especially on the day of the last migration and in order to scan a wide area it requires so many dummy accounts i got captchad right away even on my primary account which had nothing to do with the scanning accounts i created now again no judgement from me what youre going to want to do is when you are using your scanner dont have your pogo app open when you are done with using your scanner you need to log out of all apps on your phone put your phone in airplane mode for thirty seconds then turn your phone all the way off leave it off for at least a minute then turn it on thirty seconds later take off airplane mode then open only your pokemon app you should be captcha free and hopefully still have just enough time to catch whatever the scanner found for you if it sounds like a pain in the ass well thats kind of the point isnt it finding rare pokemon is supposed to be a tedious task
TheSilphRoad,removed,once you encounter a pokémon you can catch it from your iphone im sure a pogo type of catch button would not have been a problem but they deliberately decided against it
TheSilphRoad,removed,now i get that christmas event thing its all about consummation get a new tariff at sprint a frappucino at starbucks get the apple watch christmas spirit
TheSilphRoad,removed,so you cant catch pokemon directly on your watch thanksobama i prefer the go
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wonder how many people realize niantic is essentially making bank off lootcrate gambling i hadnt noticed how predatory their model is since i dont play hardcore enough to buy incubators but im seeing people who look pretty addicted it is extremely exploitative
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree with you bro 💯
TheSilphRoad,removed,do we really have to deal with gamergate nonsense even here
TheSilphRoad,removed,this cheered me up to read congrats to the pair super well deserved
TheSilphRoad,removed,son of a bitch why didnt i think of this
TheSilphRoad,removed,and how do you buy coins exactly
TheSilphRoad,removed,can you post your top page of pokemon dont feel embarrassed fool its just a game and this is the internet this post was to see how different regions look based on the rarity of spawns etc i know ny spawns a lot of rares so im sure its similar lets see your pokemon for research obv
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah its what does the current line up look like for the top players from different areas youre right about not everyone usingused scanners but i dont think youd argue that the top playershighest level dedicated players in your area wouldnt be taking advantage of a tracking system if it wasnt illegalbanworthy and if you didnt youd drastically fall behind the level players in your area have never used scanners the whole community is pretty much in an outrage with niantic with the current state of the tracking system so its funny that you guys act like people dont use it if you dont thats cool but then youre not a serious player if youre not taking advantage of a tracking tool that a majority of players use anyone level and says that never used a tracker would be funny considering how well the in game sightings menu is for tracking pokemon down so saying look what ive caught using a scanner is ridiculous if you have good pokemon youve used it if not your an idiot and you prob have crappy pokemon and if you have crappy pokemon and seeing my list of pokemon intimidated you soo much that you saw this post as a look what ive caught post im sorry bro you can post your top page and no one will judge do you see how other people who werent intimidated by the pic posted their top page up to show what the pokemon look like in their area its alright though youll get there eventually i think you need to play some more and not just go on reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,must resist the urge
TheSilphRoad,removed,lololol bro youre the one crying on reddit making a big deal other ppl posted their line up why would you even waste time if you saw this post thought it was a brag bc youre a level mystic player or something why not just exit the thread if you didnt want to post your line up like other people but felt threatened by all of those snorlax bro its cool man you dont have to send a private message apologizing and asking for advice about how to play this game better just dont act like a little girl on a thread where you feel like you need to get your butt buddy to come and defend you both of you if everyone in the community is using scanners the actual people who play and put time into this game then you have no valid argument by saying ppl catch rare pokemon with scanners if you werent using a scanner resulting in your pokemon line up to look very sad youre an idiot i cant imagine feeling the need to call someone a bragger scanneruser because their pokemon were far superior than mine but im also no a pussy like you two ill stop bc id imagine you guys have it hard enough if thats what you do on reddit sorry bros
TheSilphRoad,removed,where are you from
TheSilphRoad,removed,thx bro i found out why you and your buddy are upset i apologize for using the tools the community provided in order to get good pokemon you just wouldnt survive in socal you must be from iowa or some place
TheSilphRoad,removed,ahhhhhhh okay i understand now youre one of those people that wrote an essay explaining the types of people that use scanners nice post btw very informative so i would fall into the category im on team valor and when the game started within the first few weeks i knew the dedicated mystic players bc they were almost the same level as i was with similar pokemon as the game progressed the balance shifted to mystic as almost no team valor appeared present in my city and although i stuck with it hitting level first etc i was the only valor while the same mystic players continued to level to and a bunch surpassed me as you know the current meta of the gym game is snorlax lapras and once you get multiple gyms held you throw a dragonite so you dont get booted out in order to collect your gym rewards so i was at level of your post then i noticed someone mention a twitter page i know as soon as those mystic players find out about it theyll be stocking up so i had to take advantage of the twitter if i wanted to stay on par with these players one of them already had over snorlax before the twitter was available i caught in the few days it was active if you were in the same situation as i was considering you were actively collecting gyms a day and the other team had a much stronger gym presence what do you do i understand your post was to inform those players that didnt know about scanners and how one could have a much larger advantage depending on how they used it so any player whos trying to have top of pokemon would take advantage of said tool otherwise the competition will and you cant compete every area is different obviously whether they have there own city twitter or just fpm is available the top players would be using whatever gave them the biggest advantage right if on your list was available theyd be doing that if only was available theyd do that over etc just know when youre saying look what ive caught with a scanner that everyone with good pokemon is using a scanner and if theyre not check out fakekittens post on this thread hes apparently a legit level thats what you get with no scanner and just the sightings niantic provided lmfao but really check his pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,lmao who do you know never used a single tracker and has top tier pokemon fakekitten hes level and hes got a single vaporeon youve used a tracker to find at least of your rare pokemon you admitted that honestly i dont understand why you lold at that youd be a moron not to use a tracker if thats available how big of a disadvantage is it going tracker vs no tracker you wrote a whole post about it lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,of those steps actually just a ceiling fan spinning
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game could add an estimated million years of additional lifetime to us players alone and we still wont have a functional tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,gameplay balance the game balance will be totally destroyed imagine all the people that dont have a lapras or a snorlax yet sudenttly having all defenders as a snorlax or a larpas its easy you just have to buy one or ask your friend who has to give you one all gyms will become bispecies making it much worse than what it already is have you been to a gym lately or since the game came out this game has been unbalanced since the beginning trading is just going to highlight the issue there is only pokemon worth having not including the ones not released yet
TheSilphRoad,removed,so if you just want to know the time that is necessary to take down a defending mon in general i think you just need to take its hp stat and multiply it with its def stat and then divide that thing by its highest weakness eg dragonite would be divided by if im not mistaken this should be pretty simple to do
TheSilphRoad,removed,wat it measures distance via gps not a pedometer
TheSilphRoad,removed,what on earth is happening to this sub isnt this the kind of inane drivel we all left rpokemongo to avoid
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey spammer you said to expect a court order you said to expect last week still waiting or are you a liar as well as a spammer oh and hey noticed youre using a url redirect to link your banned site thats also against reddit rules just like using accounts to upvote and comment on your own stuff like you have in the past
TheSilphRoad,removed,no matter how many times i explain this its too hard for some people heres my last attempt to explain this as simply as possible umichaeldt informed me that on some phones sightings doesnt work properly it works properly on my samsung galaxy edge and my friends iphones and
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh nice i like this one better than tracking tool
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can check my app pktrainr its all community sourced locations for pokemon nests its available on android and in beta on ios httpwwwpktrainrcom
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,why dont you set one up then its pretty easy creating accounts and getting them ready takes for accounts was faster before they added recaptcha
TheSilphRoad,removed,just using this tool to create a personal map around my home httpsgithubcommchristopherpokemongodesktopmapreleases
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,almost embarrassed
TheSilphRoad,removed,what no im not talking to someone who strapped a tablet and a phone to his torso then walked out in public to play a game
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,whats your skype show you webcam cba to plug in my phoen and edit my name out i show you
TheSilphRoad,removed,ecks dee
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate push notifications so much graaaaagh i had to disable them for some apps because they got so damn annoying facebook im looking at you guess ill be doing the same with pogo
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is what they concentrate on
TheSilphRoad,removed,so hows that blow job going no seriously i just cant lol sounds like fun work though i used to go to school right next to scripps in la jolla one of my favorite courses ever was animal cognition i remember going to scripps for a lot of the sources i used on my research paper glottal vs nasal echolocation
TheSilphRoad,removed,bounties are a good idea i am not entirely annoyed by gym stagnation ths is mostly a result of how many players niantic has driven away through their prioritization of changes they spend more resources on ending map scanning than they do on fixing tracking they could of done the inverse and ould of seen a deine in scanners as a result of making the game more playable i got everything that i wantneed and am on the stardust grind now so i couldnt care less i am after cluster spawns and i just press the flashy button to maybe capture stuff now i want to see more pvp action though bounties are a good start but i want to see direct pvp battling and not this ai controlled nonsense that people ust dump the highest cp rated pokemon into anyways
TheSilphRoad,removed,i looked because i was hoping that they would not be so stupid to ask if anyone caught a new pokemon they hadnt before with the tracker broken meaning people cant actually track them and would respond with mostly anger why are they in fact that stupid this is not the communication people are asking for ninatic
TheSilphRoad,removed,okay thanks for the input i dont think its a stretch to trust someone who must know better such as fpm guy its a shame hes politicizing the issue
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is an explanation as to why battery life is worse now
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey trainer you took a blood oath to catch them all dont make us brick your device every catch counts
TheSilphRoad,removed,how do you know thats the reason they probably just added the gym because they want less pokestops so people buy balls
TheSilphRoad,removed,but there is also reasonable consumption afaik there are no wanted features that would even explain this much battery drain
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dislike the price of balls almost as much as i dislike selfrighteous buttgerbils
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dislike the price of balls almost as much as i dislike selfrighteous colongerbils
TheSilphRoad,removed,but as a business it becomes all about the money agreed
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a way to take advantage of players that dont live in or near an urban environment you either have pokestops or you visit the pokemart
TheSilphRoad,removed,now pokemon go is just another mobile game that reminds you to play it every now and then
TheSilphRoad,removed,i didnt see an option to not display pop ups or notifications i shouldnt really have to go to the os settings to block everything
TheSilphRoad,removed,when you dont have nougat to pokemon go netflix and chill
TheSilphRoad,removed,had the same thing happen to me tonight as well really hoping this is a bug and is fixed soon and not just niantics latest strategy to ruin their game
TheSilphRoad,removed,fresh intel just came in unironically calling yourself a trainer is considered super gay in every country pokemon go has rolled out in
TheSilphRoad,removed,same definitely not just a minor fix totally changes things when im a passenger playing with friends
TheSilphRoad,removed,good people should really stop playing while driving its how it worked in ingress when you trip the speed limit youre literally useless until you return to walking speed im surprised pokemons and pokestops remain actionable in pogo at driving speed
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not sure it had anything to do with driving but i may not have been looking for it i kept having to restart the app to get it to start scanning again whether i was moving or not specifically theres a spawn point as i turn into my driveway and i always have to stop and wait or seconds for it to show up on my screen even if its on my radar tonight after resetting the app several times in the or so minutes before i suspected something was going on so i waited a couple minutes and nothing when i restarted the app there was my ratata right where it always is anyway somethings broken no tracker no scanners now no way to drive around and find pokemon is niantic trying to kill the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah give it a couple of days all or so gyms around me are level and no one even tries to take them down i havent had a chance to prestige a gym since tuesday and i dont feel like taking one down because a i already hold and b it will be trained back up to level
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have defended them up until now but this will kill gameplay they are just trying to ruin this game for rural players
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think niantics business model is this bring folks in with the nostalgia get a few bucks out of them for a few weeks then ratchet up the grind so bad that players quit and they wont scare away more new players no snark intended i really think this is their philosophy to me at level it just feels like the game wants me to go away already all the changes they have made recently dont feel much like changes at all my catch rates seem as bad as it ever was even with all these gold medals no buddy should create candy at per the buddy system actually got me walking less because the incentive felt so poor that it discouraged me from playing at all the tracker issues of course shutting down party mapping yadda yadda ive only ever played one other mobile game that made me feel i wasnt wanted and that was star wars uprising which is shutting down next month due to poor revenue they launched an incomplete product that was all grind and offered very little incentive to spend money it was a game that relied almost entirely on its license to drive interest while delivering a game that just wasnt very fun it feels so damn similar to pokemon go you know i was going to say at least pogo doesnt rely on gambling to get players spending and then realized that incubators are pretty much that were all just hoping that the next egg we find will be a or the next egg we hatch wont be an eevee
TheSilphRoad,removed,the problem is that if you are a passenger you are able to say hey pull over theres a dragonite nearby because its much easier to cover ground at through a suburban area than to just sit at a parknest and pray something rate spawns this ruins that aspect which is how i have so many snorlax
TheSilphRoad,removed,another nail in the coffin
TheSilphRoad,removed,this makes me upset i drive my daughter around to the pokestop areas that we could not possibly get to on foot for my busriding friends this has ruined all of their game play for the day as well even at walking speeds if i do not bring up the journal in order to update my area nothing shows up on the nearby list until i do the nearby list is severely stunted now which has further ruined this game for us this makes purchasing the pokemon go plus wristband thingee useless to me now that it will not spin stops or hit pokemon on stops that occupy roads
TheSilphRoad,removed,i did too i had to hit the journal every steps wait for it to update then even longer for any sightings to show up this is exactly what they should do if they want to lose me and refund some good money i invested on behalf of a game my daughter and i used to enjoy
TheSilphRoad,removed,you have to run in circles
TheSilphRoad,removed,i noticed the same thing tonight when i was driving on the freeway i thought i was softbanned until i stopped at a stoplight and a machop appeared crazy
TheSilphRoad,removed,take your office topic bitching elsewhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is game breaking for me if its not a bug then i quit no lie no lie no liiiiiieeeee
TheSilphRoad,removed,now if they made push notifications if a pokemon spawned nearby while pogo is in background
TheSilphRoad,removed,does anyone else feel that niantic keeps making more and more changes that make the game increasingly difficult to play
TheSilphRoad,removed,well good way to lose even more players good thinking
TheSilphRoad,removed,the same thing im facing today now this is completely nonsense niantic is killing their own game how do they expect us to walk all day when we have places to go we have life to live i mean it is acceptable when they make the eggs to hatch only at walking speed but spawning no niantic you are being ludicrous
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont get it why do they want to kill their own game so bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,confirmed is the limit at spawns everywhere everything dies after you stop takes about sec for things to come back this really suck for people riding passenger looking for things i could understand interstate speeds you are not jumping off for that blastoise but kills almost any ability to ride shotgun and see spawns which is how i got several of my rares including snorlax
TheSilphRoad,removed,good try niantic but i will continue to play your game and stress your server
TheSilphRoad,removed,now lets add a tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,i pray this isnt true my city has an infamously terrible bus service and the only consolation for me when i take it is catching sometimes rare pokemon as it drives quite far through the city to my destination
TheSilphRoad,removed,go just became a little more redundant
TheSilphRoad,removed,fpm will be returning very soon according to the creator the changes niantic did were basically add load and lag on weaker phones and other very easy things to bypass niantic is wasting their and our time by fighting a pointless war
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats me d
TheSilphRoad,removed,more likely that the huge dropoff of players allowed them to implement it fpm stated they have around accounts the number of pokemon go players who have quit measures is over in the tens of millions area
TheSilphRoad,removed,the good players
TheSilphRoad,removed,this would really suck as a suburban player playing on public transport is by far my best opportunity to play the game if they kill that off i really dont know if i want to continue playing changes like these would be fine if they fixed the goddamn game first so rural and suburban players would have the same opportunities as urban players right now theyre just making the gap even bigger are pokéstops disabled at those speeds now as well because that might just be the final straw for me especially when my internship starts soon ill simply have no time anymore to walk circles in my towns center like a goddamn lunatic to spin some stops as those are the only stops in a radius of several km and id be forced to either buy balls for exorbitant prices or quit the game and my choice would be the latter despite already having dropped euros on this game ugh
TheSilphRoad,removed,great once again my hour commute each way has become boring
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hated this new system because most of the players in my city are mystic im valor there are way more mystics than players from other teams so there are many level blue gyms that i cant take down by myself without using a shitload of potions and revives and im always atacking them alone because there are so few valors i used to take a gym every day now i cant do that this update only works well if the number of players in each team is balanced
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is bloody ridiculous what about those of us who bought the pokemon go for this very reason everywhere i drive i keep the plus in my hand and press it every time it vibrates some days i dont have time to go walking or i just cant be bothered but if theyre going to force me to walk everywhere to catch pokemon then itll be seriously time for me to contemplate giving up the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,even at walking speeds now sometimes all sightings disappear then reappear a minute later makes the only piss weak method of finding mons useless they really dont want you to find anything anymore having to watch the sightings continuously was way more dangerous than knowing where you were going having a scanner so you could watch your surroundings and not get run over
TheSilphRoad,removed,yet they have a medal called jogger
TheSilphRoad,removed,tldr i´m in the dominant team and enjoy rent seeking
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow youre selfcentered wont change anything for you maybe but the vast majority of people dont have nearly as many pokestops where they live in my suburbs theres only stops and a gym if that was a pokestop for the controlling team then they would have more stops than everyone else thats more items for one team how can you say that doesnt change anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont worry pokemon go has a special battery draining feature that ensures our phones stay warm
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i was hoping they finally did background processing
TheSilphRoad,removed,adding a nonidiotic tracking system would make fpm and other scanners obsolete
TheSilphRoad,removed,boooring in the main series game you can use any pokemon you want and compete even competitively a guy won the worlds with a pachirisu
TheSilphRoad,removed,not on the
TheSilphRoad,removed,that really sucks my kids love being in charge of all devices and trying to grab things when were driving in suburbia mph type speeds also my kids will tell me if something is good in the tray as we approach some particular areas so i can decide whether or not to pull off and check i get their reasoning but its going to affect playability for a lot of people esp in cold weather
TheSilphRoad,removed,for major city players clearly the only demographic niantic understandscares to design for
TheSilphRoad,removed,paying for pokeballs what in the world thats like paying to use the public water fountain
TheSilphRoad,removed,yea last time i was evolving my phone only crashed once
TheSilphRoad,removed,mkay ive been holding off on getting up in arms about any of their attempts at stopping cheaters which invariably end up biting the casual player but this one bites me hard and personally and im not into that kind of stuff either im still playing this game actively because of the ability to play as a passenger my dad who is getting on in age does not play the game himself but anytime we go somewhere and he drives he takes detours because hes memorized the stops and spawns in the surrounding neighborhoods its such a little thing but its given us some great time together and it makes me happy to see my old dad enjoying it vicariously through my glee at the good catches i noticed last night that more mons were running from me and less were appearing so if the coding has been deliberately revised to make catching as a passenger harder if not impossiblewell forget this thats my sob story and im sticking to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah and they somehow messed up my list goes blank even on foot then i have to wait seconds for pokemons to reappear
TheSilphRoad,removed,nothing stopping you from knocking it down stop complaining and do somthing about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a big round button on the top right corner of the store page
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is the main problem bad reception makes my game say your going too fast fairly often when im just walking so now i wont know if im locked out of seeing pokemon or if the tracker is not working again lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i run the game for myself and my wife on my morning commute and i noticed that once we hit the sightings vanished i assumed it was due to a gps issue or just a dry period but im thinking it may be a restriction now if so there goes the winter for me hopefully i still want to play in the spring
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they did make that change i am very glad my mom recently totaled her car playing pokémon at a stop light
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant even battle gyms anymore pogo runs more slowly with each update
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is my first time really complaining about this game my daughter and i go to lots of placers together just yesterday we got a charmander because as i was driving she saw the charmander and we hunted it down now sigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,there isnt always choice involved in staying out to the point of frostbite it only takes five to ten minutes in temps with a wind of about to get frostbite get out of the car and walk for only minutes in one direction and by the time you turn around and get back its been more than minutes and youve already started to get frostbitten and nobody deserves to have health problems or get hurt thats meanspirited and cruel to think that way about your fellow human beings
TheSilphRoad,removed,having watched mothers sitting at lures while their bored wandering year olds play with cigarette buts id like to see something enter their minds once a day
TheSilphRoad,removed,you say it makes sense and i agree with you if they made it that way to start with but i disagree when it comes to changing things so drastically months down the line
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a little bit overboard removing the game while driving around town will make sure the game wont survive through winter i am sure that i wont be getting outside to walk around in degree weather
TheSilphRoad,removed,why niantic why you are supposed to make the game more playable to players by doing this you guys are actually making people play less nbsp if this was chess you guys are making bad moves with these sanctions
TheSilphRoad,removed,i live in a small rural town spawns are spread out and mostly garbage i drive around with my son and he tells me when theres something good nearby to find i suppose thats over also if niantic is going to limit play to those moving under can they get rid of the i am a passenger pop up clicking it no longer means anything apparently
TheSilphRoad,removed,hopefully this is a bug and not an intentional change seems ridiculous to make such a change after all this time
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh goody i can see it now hey trainer youre in range of a mcdonaldsunion bankjamba juicezipcar pokéstop open the pokénmon go app and your wallet now
TheSilphRoad,removed,putting money in this game no way
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you psa what did you eat today
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i thought my game was bugged im very upset with this decision ive spotted a lot of my rarer pokemon through commute but now theyve taken that away ive tolerated most of the bad choices theyve made but i think ive had it theyre just killing their own game and with the weather getting colder the game will be practically unplayable
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre joking right considering how hot this game makes my phone i think ill be fine when im at home i sometimes need to put my phone on an ice pack for christ sake
TheSilphRoad,removed,why are you doing anything than walking around with a glorified fit bit thats all the game was intended to be
TheSilphRoad,removed,every positive story we hear like this one from the uk motivates us to keep working to support the game and continue the rollout well what about the players stopping because theres no way to track down pokémons because their tracker isnt properly walking since months or what about the stories of millions of players happy to catch that laprassnorlax because of trackers because they saw it with minuts left and could run through the city to get it also this graphic always annoyed me it has no scales on spatial queries per second which always made me think its bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow so if you get out of your car youll fall through ice but if you play while driving youll get a mere fender bender congratulations you are the most unassuminglybiased pogo player to date heres your golden razzberry award
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive been able to get more than coins every day of course you like this situation when its benefiting you the problem is there are hundreds of times more players than gyms and everyone cant get any coins at all now enemy gyms at level take an hour to defeat which is not worth coins friendly gyms at level might as well not exist theres no way to interact with them congrats that you stumbled on some friendly gyms with space for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,grats niantic you just made people want third party trackers even more as one good gps drift will now blind a player for going too fast
TheSilphRoad,removed,gym stagnation good for the dominant teams great for the players on those teams bad for the players who are left out awful for the future of the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,the game isnt popular anymore so the media wouldnt care if a gun came out of the screen and blew someones head off theyre not gonna care about this
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a logical progression step take tracker away step lower egg hatching sped to an absurdly low number step add a super annoying pop up whenever the game thinks youre going faster than walking speed step remove all party maps without first fixing in game tracker step make sure no one has fun playing the game in a car anymore because obviously the only people that could have the game open at driving speeds are the drivers themselves but keep the pop up that is now all but pointless future step solve complicated captchas every time you want to throw a pokeball to combat botters future step release pokemon go specific phonelike device for that is only able to play pokemon go and ingress and disable all other devices from launching the game in all seriousness what annoys me most is that there have been times i have seen something really rare on my sightings while on the road and have stopped to go find it in fact my only lickitung came from it popping up on sightings while driving to a friends house and i was able to find it same with a snorlax and i also saw a lapras on the sightings list but i was never able to track that one down it is beyond baffling why they think this is a good idea i almost always have a friend in the car who has the game up to tell me if anything pops up that is worth finding
TheSilphRoad,removed,using reverse digital photocryptography via a retro encabulator i have deobfuscated your image and now know where you live prepare for multiple glitter bombs in your mailbox
TheSilphRoad,removed,at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you have the goplus you would still be able to throw at all those pokemon you cant see while it may work as a driverplay deterrent it also works as a the kids cant pokemon in the car on trips around town and are loosing intetest in the game and i need to find another way to entertain in the car only a nephew here a few times a week but he wasnt having it last night
TheSilphRoad,removed,looks like i cant play on my morning bus commute anymore what a bunch of idiots over at niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh wow so this is what was happening to me well that sucks even more than everything else that doesnt work about the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i leveled up a gym yesterday from just barely level to points short of level then my gps drifted and locked me out of the gym great time
TheSilphRoad,removed,where else would they put it also who cares about karma
TheSilphRoad,removed,a stock is almost nothing like playing a game for fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,so you can see spawns at but not interesting residential speed limit in ny state is and in a lot of states but i just checked and of course the residential speed limit in san francisco is so they made it to still show sightings to people there in sf or other highly populated areas that have the slower residential limit of but in more ruralless populated areas like upstate ny where the limit is we get nothing but a blank sightings box thats very nice of niantic to once again cater to their own area and fail to think outside their own limited scope just awesome s
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was gonna say you just copied this from uwhitelistip lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love how they put these measures in devs bypass them and then regular players just get the shafts its just like root ban when is niantic going to stop working against and start working with the community
TheSilphRoad,removed,im slowly losing the last of my will to keep playing this game im a small town player the town has very few spawns im drowning in pidgey rattata eevee venonat spearow weedle caterpie and krabby with the occasional exeggcute oddish bellsprout clefairy bulbasaur goldeen staryu and horsea my town is completely dominated by the opposing team im one of maybe active members on my team but they hardly ever bother to take down the gyms they just wait for me to do it meanwhile the opposing team all coordinate via facebook group and travel around together to build up and reinforce every gym in town and every gym in the small neighboring towns dragon fire fighting psychic electric rock ground and steel types as well as any water type thats not krabbystaryugoldeenhorsea are virtually impossible to find my town is nothing but up and down hills with about pokestops mostly spread out over the entire town walking the town is exhausting to say the least most of the best spawn points are too far away to reasonably walk to there are wild dogs everywhere that make it unsafe to go on foot to a lot of areas where pokemon spawn in the past few days the few spawn points i actually have within range of my house have drastically reduced the number and quality of pokemon they spawn a week ago one cluster spawn within range of my house was spawning pokemon about every minutes and spawning rare pokemon multiple times a daynight the past several days all it has spawn are pokemon mostly weedle pidgey caterpie rattata and venonat the spawn behind my house that spawned rare pokemon seems to have either disappeared completely or my radar no longer picks it up now i cant even catch pokemon while riding around in the car and winter is on its way between all of this crap thats making it more and more difficultfrustrating to play and not even being able to find halfway decentrare pokemon even in larger neighboring cities much less my own i dont know how much longer ill hold interestand it sucks because this game has done so much to help me with my anxiety issues and has really pushed me to finally get out of the safety of my house and get some much needed exercise fresh air and social interaction
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres the thing with gym stagnation that has been brought up before if people dont burn the gym to the ground it just gets stronger and stronger theres a gym here with i swear dragonites and two exeggcutors all cp plus it doesnt help that there was a dratini farm here either i built up a gym earlier and a guy said my best friend is blue hell come take that seel out later so we can make this stronger well if you have a buddy on another team its nothing to knock the low guy and make it stronger and stronger locking out and knocking out other team members and until the prestige changes to make it so that the you have to do more than just beat the lowest mon to knock it out nothing will change how that works
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats stupid playing while driving is far far more dangerous than being outside during the winter if someone wants to risk their health playing in the cold that is their choice playing while driving puts other peoples lives at risk
TheSilphRoad,removed,well damn most of my play time is on my minute bus commute to and from work if i cant play then my desire to play is going to take a severe hit
TheSilphRoad,removed,if this is a permanent change niantic needs to beef up lures and incenses there should be absolutely no reason why they spawn pidgeys and rattatas i went with my family to a seel nest park yesterday and we managed to catch less then pokemon each on the walking trails after about an hour we then set up a lure at the playground so my toddler could play every single spawn from the lure was a pidgey or rattata without a passenger catching the pokemon youre looking at less then pokemon during a trip to the park its not really worth it at that point before we could pick up pokemon each just running errands around town and breaking no traffic laws
TheSilphRoad,removed,the most amusing thing this is all players guessing the company will not tell the mechanics of the game niantics incompetence continues to amaze me whoevers responsible for giving them the pokémon brand destroyed what could have been a revolution in gaming
TheSilphRoad,removed,i personally think that it isnt morally wrong to fix something clearly broken but the act of using a third party app to affect the gps coordinates niantic sees is bannable
TheSilphRoad,removed,you cant change your team unless youd like to share how some effort can do that
TheSilphRoad,removed,lets assume you are correct some dude sees a rare spawn in the sightings they have no idea when it spawned and when it will despawn right now they have no choice but to go to fpm and look it up knowing quite well that by the time they return it might already despawn now if there was an existing tracking system in place what do you think they would rather do follow it fast using the tracking system or waste time opening fpm and then on opening the app which takes about half a minute i had exeggutors spawn in my neighborhood at before i started using fpm i didnt even bother going out knowing i will look like an idiot running around the entire neighborhood not knowing even where the spawns are located knowing that it most likely spawned in private property and there is no way in hell to use the idiotic sightings system in order to find it that was my last straw and about the no it wouldnt for me it would become obsolete since i only ever scanned my neighborhood because the sightings is so idiotic and i have high doubts i am alone
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is just ridiculous now i often drive my kids around to play and get stops etc now we cant do that any more i bought them a lot of balls and incense too not only does this make the game far less fun but they will also lose a lot of profits
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am going to be compleetly honest here and say i used trackers throughout the time i played this game the way i used the trackers though is to basicly replace the non excisting tracker in this game when i going fromto work on the bike i always have the phone out in that route i basicly know exactly where and what spawns at this current moment partially thanks to trackers like fpm and what not id never scan for something if it didnt pop up on the radar though level almost and even with this way of playing i caught single lapras i wouldnt have if it wasnt for fpm the location it spawned in totally surprised me and i doubt many if at all any would search for that lappy in that place there sadly isnt any other rare i found with the tracker severly lacking those
TheSilphRoad,removed,so basically close your eyes and cover your ears unless someone says he is happy with the game meanwhile we will censor everything that is not a happy thought right
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for the enthusiasm but its more than clear to many of us that niantic was a terrible choice of developer for this valuable franchise our only hope now is for the powers that be to pull their rights and let a real development team start from scratch niantic blew the biggest opportunity in mobile gaming history and has done nothing but double down on their terrible decisions and shoddy workmanship let them take their huge pile of money and go be arrogant fools with their own products
TheSilphRoad,removed,i strongly believe that what you give is what you get and im not talking about sliph road vs travelers but niantic vs players i dont like whining and pessimism myself if niantic was more open if they shared their problems plans goals with fans if they simply communicated with fans then im sure that less people would be upset if fans felt that pokemon go development is for them not for niantics selfish goals basically they felt that niantic would like to give them something then im sure that the fans would be appreciative and they would give love towards the game and its developers even if niantic doesnt fulfill the request of the fans trackers etc they could give some answers and communicate and thus fans would feel them closer
TheSilphRoad,removed,so you write a big ol whine
TheSilphRoad,removed,the problem with the current gym meta is the overwhelming effect it has on player morale if youre not on the dominant team in your area since july the mystic team in my area was dominant there were gyms that valor and instinct continuously took down and fought over but more that stayed mystic for virtually all of the time over time as less valor and instinct players played thanks to both mystic dominance and the hype train derailing mystic took over fast forward to october roughly months later there are gyms in my town of just over people and theyre all level mystic gyms the average cp pokemon of the bottom defender is and the lowest level player in a gym is usually level i havent seen any other players in the area attempt to take down one of these gyms for weeks because gyms that fall are usually retaken and bubble stratted back to in an hour in the first few weeks of this game there were dozens of valor and instinct players who played just at my neighborhood park from what ive seen very few of those players are still active in my town thanks to the current meta building a high level gym is much easier than taking it down thanks to the fact that a lot of players use bubblestrat on the other hand potions are rare and revives are extremely rare which makes taking down a high level gym extremely taxing on your resources theres no doubt in my mind that the current meta is driving away many players that arent the dominant team in their area or high enough level to compete with the players that are so common in gyms frankly speaking those players are still a small fraction of the games playerbase those few dozen players in my town arent a huge percentage of the playerbase multiplied by the many many many neighborhoods towns and areas all over the world where regular players are driven out by highlevel members of the dominant team and thats a large number of players that might end up quitting the game because they cant seem to compete with everyone else in its current state tracking pokemon is difficult and time consuming potentially losing you the pokemon you want to catch on the other hand gym stagnation means that if youre not level and on the dominant team you can look forward coins a day unless you drive all over for a spot on the few gyms your team owns the combined psychological deterrent of gyms that seem impossible to take down and pokemon that seem impossible to find and catch is driving out a lot of players and both need to be addressed for the sake of this games longterm health
TheSilphRoad,removed,youre right the game is enjoyable but you cant deny that niantic is doing a really poor job at communicating their intents of where this game is headed in the future the launch trailer shows people trading and actually tracking pokemon niantic isnt communication on the development of either i always came to this subreddit because its a place for civil discussion and i think discussing these topics should be part of it yes daily treads about missing tracking and circlejerking is definitely something that should be avoided but with every update to the game these topics will come up again and again as many players me included think these are the big issues niantic should be working on when instead they seem to be busy with a witchhunt on bots and trackers that has affected the gameplay negatively again and again be it by obfuscating the code to the point of lagging out phones and draining batteries quicker or now by making the game stop working if youre going to fast whats the point of having a popup that males me confirm that im a passenger when the game stays unplayable the reason i bought a go plus was so i could play on my daily commute i get it when people defend niantics actions when they remove features from a free game but this cripples the hardware they sell for € online simply downvoting people for pointing these things out for the sake of staying positive is not the right way to go a good community is one that can handle situations like this and deal with these issues instead of denying them and i believe this community is capable of that
TheSilphRoad,removed,im glad to see that the founders of the road are not complete babies like most of the community is on this reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,does niantic not understand that gps drift is inevitable i can understand mitigating players in a car but if youre jumping back and forth there should be a simple error handler for that not blocking you out of key game features
TheSilphRoad,removed,disable gps when you push the pogo button works of the time for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know and can see where youre coming from but actually i think youre attitude is kind of a bit like how niantic behave a sort of i made this and youll behave how i want with it feel people are grumpy for good reason one of them is the endless smiley positivity of the niantic messaging if they put out messages saying we have heard this and this and this from the community we know people are unsatisfied with this and this and this and therefore these things are our priority for fixing and working on but if the community needs something more urgently perhaps we can be a bit flexible instead what you get is john hanke endlessly repeating i saw a person lets make it a child or an old person or a disabled person or anyone who is routinely patronised or treated as though they require sympathy having a wonderful time walking in the park isnt it a beautiful thing what you have to understand is the negativity you describe isnt a response just to the game but to the endless positive messaging surrounding a fundamentally broken product if niantic havent worked out how not to provoke this they should actually hire the global community manager they promised months ago how does this relate to tsr well obviously one of niantics current strategies for weathering the storm is to always appeal to an enormous mass of casual players who arent like the people at tsr actually i dont believe such a mass of casual players exists i suspect strongly that the vast majority of play hours and income comes from people playing pretty seriously and frequently that is what happens when you build a game that is so grindintense people either quickly quit or play seriously i think its fine for a community of people who do try to play the game not just casually and fun doesnt have to be casual to express a level of negativity i certainly dont think that negativity makes tsr a bad place much prefer it to smug smiles and people telling me to be more positive personally
TheSilphRoad,removed,personally i feel that in an analytical group such as tsr criticism is inevitable as praise this forum is for discussing the intricacies of pogo as i understand its purpose research is done and theories shared commenting upon these theories and conclusions should result in discussion and even argument non constructive criticism on the game and developer is childish and unhelpful the community however has a right to critique and make itself heard when the direction of the game is changed or indeed any aspect of it adjusted especially when a great number of player have invested time which is limited and precious for all of us and resources into understanding it on such a finite level as this community does we are invited to play and pay by the developer which we do with enthusiasm this investment gives us the right to discussion for good or ill
TheSilphRoad,removed,eh this sub complains less than others and complaining is typical on reddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,pokemongo sub is horrible all circle jerk complaints
TheSilphRoad,removed,just another nail in the coffin my kids play everyday in the back seat now nothing spawns there go two players real soon and they spend money winters coming and i can only take them out maybe once a week we live in a rural area have to drive mins for a good place to walk around in unbelievable how bad niantic wants this to fail without realizing
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive said this before but i dont feel like bandwagoning positivity is really any better than bandwagoning negativity either way its onesided and it can disguise where youre dumping your negativity the first word of this post calls the complainers whiners and its from one of the lead moderators it seems like whats really happening is instead of ranting about niantic this sub rants about that other lesser pokemon go sub because they rant about niantic the toxicity about the game and niantic does often get out of hand but when that many people are mad about something theres probably good reasons for it constructive criticism is better but theres no need to be condescending to people who are upsetbored with the game people have to take out their negative feelings on something at least its usually a nondescript corporate entity instead of each other also it seems like the main reason why people are losing interest in being constructive is that most of the suggested improvements dont get implemented the buddy system is the only change that people directly asked for and it does much less than many of us hoped it would and theres still no mass transferring probably the mostrequested feature maybe we just need to be patient but niantics limited communication contributes to the players impatience
TheSilphRoad,removed,me too ive stopped playing as much except when i go away from my town
TheSilphRoad,removed,see thats just a ridiculous attitude to have youre being high and mighty like theres no poop in my yard unlike my dumb neighbor while at the same time being like so what if i poop in my neighbors yard if people are being unreasonable and not contributing to any discussion then fine but to try to act like there is some high level discussion going on here while banning even reasonable complaints is just ridiculous your sub your rules and thats fine but calling valid complaints about the game whining while at the same time whining about the complaints is just silly
TheSilphRoad,removed,you really dont understand why people would be frustrated by waiting over a month for even a basic update as to their refund status real money they spent on the game and getting nothing but r in response really
TheSilphRoad,removed,my downvote reread your post please
TheSilphRoad,removed,try rpokemongopositive
TheSilphRoad,removed,i disagree negative comments and experiences are just as valid as positive ones
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly i wouldnt even say the game is far from perfect its much better than it used to be and honestly its ahead of many other triple a games out these days ahem fallout at this point its just a game a pretty great revolutionary game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know im going to be downvoted into the doghouse for saying this but it is indeed pointless to complaint or as you put it to whine about problems with pogo as niantic doesnt seem to listen or care either way i guess thats whining too also if you cant complain whine about actual problems you cant be objective
TheSilphRoad,removed,not ridiculous at all if youre a rural player driving is part of your game i had my two littlest navigators with me today and they were sad that nothing showed up normally ill pull over and well catch stuff instead we turned the game off
TheSilphRoad,removed,not only that we had stopped and a raticate appeared we moved slightly away from it and it disappeared from radar and the screen we went to where it was and it didnt show up but we left and came back and then it did dumb
TheSilphRoad,removed,i keep coming here hoping to see an update about them fixing all the problems they have created and all i see is them is them ruining more and more parts of the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,now we need someone to create a tracking app thatuhhmakes a little window over the screen and in the window it would show pokemon near you and then you go to them what a great part of the game that would be niantic you never cease to amaze me
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is fine however otoh this community is for serious players serious concerns objectivity etc i think that as moderators you have a duty to balance the culture of the users with the vision for the community itself constructive criticism often comes as complaining which is objective for me the reason to be here isnt sunshine and rainbows thats a nice bonus its elevated levels of information and discussion i mean look at the site you run thats basically the main attraction the science
TheSilphRoad,removed,come on man you cant possibly be that positive about niantic and their future features theyre killing the game im sorry but its true no im not whining im stating facts trading and gen and all these features youre looking forward toare useless for a lot of players those players who played in cars those that relied on radars and rural players for the most part too im still going to play but im doing it really casually and almost putting in no effort theres no thinking what niantic will screw up in the next update btw i couldnt care less about the inevitable circlejerk of downvotes incoming by people blinded by their nostalgia and niantic dcksucking
TheSilphRoad,removed,the big reason gym stagnation exists in my area is there are less players its great that i get my coins and dust every day but its a big sign that the game is peetering out
TheSilphRoad,removed,probably only hold them in san fran like the tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude for god sakes i used to like you but stop kissing up to niantic so much youre completely blinded to their mistakes people cant play in long car trips now people with gps drift now cant play rural players are almost completely locked out of the game and suburban players too for gods sake look at reality
TheSilphRoad,removed,gen discussion is not allowed stop posting about it
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh yeah i forgot that the answer should always be take it elsewhere and not lets get some mods who dont just silence the community
TheSilphRoad,removed,where did you find a scanner that works after the last update
TheSilphRoad,removed,let this guy live in his anti logic world i love misunderstandings like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,whereas this video game subreddit devolves into people tripping over each other to declare how much better they are than rpokemon go which i cant argue with too much
TheSilphRoad,removed,going on another meth binge
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,rural players sticking to the game are gluttons for punishment and have zero self steem or self respect just come to terms with the fact that you mean less than insects to niantic its amazing that people cling to a service that strives to make so blatantly clear it doesnt care for them
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you do you will be fine just as long as the are you a passenger box box hasnt appeared its counting your distance
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i quit this game and dont even play anymore at most id do is keep a pogo in my bag to candy but since i cant even do that the game is dead to me until they add actual gameplay rather than these minor text fixes i swear every update they just make more and more text bolder font
TheSilphRoad,removed,you have to buy a sold out accessory to do that
TheSilphRoad,removed,still highway robbery in my opinion
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think its terrible sure we can get ghost medal now but if they replace pidgeys weedles etc with these ghosts and cubones its pretty bad in total
TheSilphRoad,removed,bull literally last week they pulled features from the game with no notice they have not come a long way people have short memories this communication is good but the halloween event in no way betters their reputation yes we all love it but it is the way the game should be and doesnt magically erase all of the very recent failures by niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is what i mean about the short memory they have done all of this like today lets not forget that last week they overhauled the game and removed features without saying a word fpm is really great though glad to have a working tracker again
TheSilphRoad,removed,was very excited but ended up dissapointed really the double candy reward has no effect as youre essentially just capturing rattata all the time now eevee pidgey caterpie weedle are nearly completely off the radar and theres not a single interesting other spawn to be found anywhere the only thing worth is hatching eggs right now getting buddy candy this halloween event is horrible for pokedex competitive and exp
TheSilphRoad,removed,they will say its a bug but im sure thay are planning audio ads in the near future
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait they set the bar so low that you are now praising them for doing what any normal company would have done the whole time and now you are saying that because of their new started communication that the plus now working is not a big deal just wow people need to stop setting the bar so low that when someone or a company barely passes over it they have people like you gloating about how amazing they are
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean theres an event plus scanners are working again the scanner alone got my entire workplace redownloading it
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not spending any more money until some kind of trackerthird party tracker works again but i have to say this event is very tempting
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you regularly get km every time it updates im trying to max it out i can only seem to get or every update
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am giving away my account with all pokemon if u like watch this for more details thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait you already had a fuck ton of gastlys where you live
TheSilphRoad,removed,a douchebag
TheSilphRoad,removed,just as soon as you provide a working scanner we will get started
TheSilphRoad,removed,why do you still visit this reddit and even spend some time commenting
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantics art always strike an uncanny valley for me they have a nice overall art style but then therell be some weird shit like in the gyarados screen its segments and the spacing of railings on the bridge and on this one gengars smile what the hell
TheSilphRoad,removed,no one is defending niantic some people just are aware that things dont get fixed by themselves the fact that they dont talk a lot is not good practice of course but it never could warrant the kind of feelings people have right now im sure death threats have been sent a lot of peoples day has been made shitty because some people somehwere cant track them virtual pokemans people that works at niantic have lives families they need to sleep eat and stuff you know them making money doesnt fix code it doesnt give them energy it doesnt make anything go faster they just released the biggest app in the history of the mankind let that sink in your head a minute or two and no one is forgiving their problems the app is still running and its not like theyre not actively working on it the silence is so forgivable jeez do you understand the task of communicating with millions angry internet people most of the governments on earth probably arent even prepared for such a thing and you cant forgive a team of people that clearly have other things to do right now but yeah a message a blog post anything would help maybe theyll explain their silence in time but no one could convince me that the silence is worthy of such a witch hunt it is completly mad
TheSilphRoad,removed,went put for dinner tonight hit pokestops caught new pokemon and a ton of others and took a gym people can complain all they want ill be over here living out year old mes fantasy
TheSilphRoad,removed,keep this in the cesspool of the other sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats what she said
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah hahahahahahahahahahaha ah hahahahahahahahahaha how can someone be that gullible i am sorry op but do you hear what you are saying naintic community manager in all seriousness the twitter got hacked and some guy is just trolling
TheSilphRoad,removed,you got that right
TheSilphRoad,removed,just give me a lil hit of that stardust manill suck your dick manjust need a lil stardust
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol thats retarded
TheSilphRoad,removed,pmd

TheSilphRoad,removed,if like to be a tester level year old girl i play hours a day brookealanacomcastnet
TheSilphRoad,removed,im the president of nintendo i know this because of some sauce on my clothes
TheSilphRoad,removed,its legit the trainer kaitcovey claims she was sent an apology email from niantic along with articuno as a gift
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes but they effectively said nothing of substance with those empty words
TheSilphRoad,removed,that honestly doesnt help much current players wont care about the global release
TheSilphRoad,removed,crap response but its a start
TheSilphRoad,removed,brazilian confirmed downvote away gentlemen
TheSilphRoad,removed,i still dont understand rpokemongo s rage against niantic for not speaking i dont understand how yes we are working on things does anything i much rather niantic spend their time doing things for the game rather than tweeting out bullshit that doesnt matter saying yes we are doing x is a pointless tweet that could be better spent working on real things
TheSilphRoad,removed,everyone here so far has been optimistic and taking their words for what theyre worth but the cynic side of me believes their answer for the display was utter horseshit they removed it because they couldnt fix it in a timely matter not meeting product goals sounds like pr speak for we cant get it to work so we need to scrap it the second paragraph just reinforces their lack of foresight and preparedness for this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait so first its cheating and removing the sense of fun now its just bogging down our servvveers maaaaan they truly need to make up a story and stick to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a shame its not possible to invest in more servers
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dropped the old db and i downloaded it again from here httpsgithubcombrideaupokelyzerblobmasterpokemongodbbackuptar and restored it looks like at least the pokemongoera table is there now httpimgurcomajybms i still get the error from last night the fact that it looks for an undefined column is quite strange maybe theres some discrepancies from my pokemon map files my pokelyzer files and my database files since i diluted the procedure in several days thus conflicting version and such but thats just my hypothesis
TheSilphRoad,removed,the points of interest are meant to help quicken the search the basic triangulation is what actually delivers its how gps work
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know youre a complete failure when you can even use a year old meme correctly
TheSilphRoad,removed,at some point i assume based of ingress you can view other players profiles it was cool having an onyx tier guardian badge to show off or platinum tier spec ops badge basically just achievements that are cool to show off to your friends
TheSilphRoad,removed,kinda disappointed now that i got in to be honest
TheSilphRoad,removed,not gonna happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,should not have said am if it wasnt going to be released at am
TheSilphRoad,removed,the code is here kappa
TheSilphRoad,removed,because its not enough to get trolled by niantic alone
TheSilphRoad,removed,kill yourself
TheSilphRoad,removed,well people on the internet get angered fast
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is not fun many people planned a little gap in their day to get the code and continue on with their life here we are minutes later
TheSilphRoad,removed,was super excited when i discovered the silph road yesterday however my faith in them has already dwindled close to nothing in a matter of minutes
TheSilphRoad,removed,not cool
TheSilphRoad,removed,fucc u gaylord
TheSilphRoad,removed,its starting to feel like blatant disregard
TheSilphRoad,removed,i believe they messed with the timezone
TheSilphRoad,removed,so mondays release was announced to be at but were releases at that true so then perhaps todays relase announced as will be at
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks a lot guys
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,is the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,you guys saw it was posted right
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank mr skeltal
TheSilphRoad,removed,how about everyone in this forsaken community just stops acting like this company owes them anything more than the video game they created thanks
TheSilphRoad,removed,i got it
TheSilphRoad,removed,well the rch a hospital in omaha and ohio all made a public fuss about it blame them not niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,you were whining about allowing niantic to violate google play tos and telling people to downvote you of course you got downvotes
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,right id been fucking peeved that they were doing all this shit and not saying a word after reading their statement i relaxed and thought thank you was that so frigging hard
TheSilphRoad,removed,its gone from the frontpage so obviously they have a problem with you
TheSilphRoad,removed,what if its an electabuzz
TheSilphRoad,removed,what do you think this screenshot adds to this sub seriously
TheSilphRoad,removed,analysis is definitely fine thats probably one of our core activities so long trading isnt here we recently added a rule that we no longer allow iv related questions in this subreddit as we were getting a little overwhelmed with them we created a new sister subreddit rpokemongoivs specifically for that purpose we realize it may look like were stopping a lot of posts but its all to the benefit of the community we try to keep a nice balance of high quality posts around here and try to offer alternatives for nonroad material discussion
TheSilphRoad,removed,those posts would be best suited for rpokemongoivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is clearly a bug theyve accidentally taken a somewhere where they shouldnt have in the code that determines what spawns in the nests this is why almost all of them have changed systematically downwards in the pokedex and theres now twice as many bulbasaur and no dratini nests the guys at niantic prove over and over that their staff are incompitant
TheSilphRoad,removed,this post was more targeted at the people who defended niantic after the threestep glitch and said shit like now its more like the pokemon games i totally get that pokevision was likely causing server issues but so is the other dozen or so programs coming out and all the bot programs that are constantly shared on this sub the issue is not going to get fixed by removing them one at a time fix the root problem no way to track in game first
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am giving you a video tutorial how to do something you denied being in the realm of feasibility
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just play enjoy my time outside and dont give a fuck about xp
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean ive hatched two and gotten two eevees so thats burned into my mind pretty sharply i also live in an area with a ton of eevees of my highest cps are eeveelutions i swear if my next egg is another eevee
TheSilphRoad,removed,so nothing then great
TheSilphRoad,removed,some people are so brainless there are ways to play this game exercise and play pay and play pokevision allowed people who play for free to complete the game at an equal or greater rate than someone who pays its a business guys thats why you run out of pokeballs thats why you get to see how cool incense and lures are when you start but seldom get them as you progress
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic literally has to know by now you know what i mean its trending on facebook i know we give them shit for not staying up with us but when something this big happens they have to know
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i agree with you here the second phone really makes it believable dunno why everyone here is acting as if they want it to be fake who the fuck cares if she has one
TheSilphRoad,removed,the elitism on this sub isnt even subtle anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry self entitled pricks arent exactly likeable in this day and age
TheSilphRoad,removed,this community is made great by all of you then can we get that stupid no swearing garbage removed please im getting tired of using ascii workarounds to do it
TheSilphRoad,removed,someone literally just proved you wrong you have to cycle the names and it refreshes them
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol youre a redundant subreddit to rpokemongo now all of us power players are leaving for subreddits like rpokemongodev because we can get the tools and information we need there now this inperson network is a pipedream that just killed your subreddit by trying to put your own personal gain from your app ahead of the community and its interests
TheSilphRoad,removed,umm notice the pokeball count at the bottom its going downnot staying the same fake and gay
TheSilphRoad,removed,three weeks waiting after hanke said they were working on it sdcc was last week ya selfentitled hacker
TheSilphRoad,removed,just wait another week till niantic answers to this yang liu dropping the disrespect in name of all pokemon players
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,this articundo has pretty shitty ivs
TheSilphRoad,removed,this happend to me yesterday night and i had a cool nickname fuccinstinct and now its lost forever
TheSilphRoad,removed,he facilitate cheating he gave an advantage to people who were just playing with the app alone and no small advantage but a massive advantage to go exactly where the most desirable pokemon in an entire city or town not just your immediate area as originally intended were and catch them leaving the masses who were not such more than casuals the masses who play with just the app to be at a significant disadvantage you people on here only care about yourselves and those casuals which are the majority dont fool yourselves youre a vocal minority arent here to speak for themselves and never would be theyd just do something else with their time when you all would repeatedly blow them out at gyms or whatever with your dragonites and snorlaxes against their pitiful low cp vaporeons at best most true casuals arent even there
TheSilphRoad,removed,im glad youve improved your game why do we need a thread like this every days
TheSilphRoad,removed,no meaningful updates in days no gen still why isnt this on clearance
TheSilphRoad,removed,why would anyone buy one of these now gotta catch another version of those pokemon that u already have that are worthless on gyms which are completely pointless in themselves
TheSilphRoad,removed,heres a sneak peek of httpsnpredditcomrpokemongodev using the httpsnpredditcomrpokemongodevtopsorttoptall of all time pokemon go map visualization google maps view of all the pokemon in your hash algorithm its been fun im a bot beep boop downvote to remove httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
TheSilphRoad,removed,man i think that spoofers are cáncer in the game if they are still out there the game is fucked up niantic needs to ban them all
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah but they have to but another one at least isnt that easy
TheSilphRoad,removed,rampant in our city theres a spoofer group here that pretty much owns the gyms its like mass carnage when the horde goes on a rampage they take down gyms in minutes and pop up em up with a horsea on the bottom and filled with pokemon oh and a big ass chansey is invariably placed right after that horsea not much fun here
TheSilphRoad,removed,you cannot beat them because there is a big difference between the old spoofers and the new spoofbotters there is literally no effort for the bots the owners are just watching tv sleeping or playing some other game while you bang your head against a wall niantic does nothing with reports and my jaded guess is too much of their remaining player base is bots and they have shareholders who monitor the daily player stats would be bad for business to ban half your player base i gave up you cant get them banned and you cant beat them i dont bother to help my team anymore because it is a waste of effort i just walk my dog and play blind with the new tracker in suburbia hell hitting the pogo when it goes off and see what ran away later i dont bother even taking my phone out of my pocket anymore sad but true bots and the horrible new tracker have ruined the game for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a big fountain and its perfectly visible on google street view and here is where this whole thing becomes interesting op asked why is this building colored blue on screenshot we can clearly see that avatar is standing in the middle of the building that in fact is a big rectangular fountain if op would be in this place for real he wouldnt have to ask this question because he would stand in water up to his knees conclusion op is a fking spoofing fraud try to tell me otherwise
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a horrible movie ferris is such an asshole the movie only becomes passable if you accept it as a story by a pathological liar
TheSilphRoad,removed,you sit across the street and do not know theres a fountain with a size of basketball field come on even you must admit that it sounds highly unlikely plus you gave exact coordinates of this place in google maps whats easier than to switch to satellite view here fixed it for you and see it from your desk across the street
TheSilphRoad,removed,i agree i would like to be able to listen to my music or at least have a definitive answer that you cant not this maybe itll play for a few minutes maybe more stuff that being said this is a discussion for rpokemongosolutions not tsr
TheSilphRoad,removed,fuck that aint nobody got time for leg day
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop pausing music
TheSilphRoad,removed,if enough players have reported the botter spoofer then that could be enough flags against their account to get into the next ban wave if that is so why hasnt fsuatl been banned yet hes getting reported a million more times than anyone else and still isnt getting banned why isnt niantic banning this guy because they dont ban people only from reports
TheSilphRoad,removed,this we got shafted this christmas welp im taking my much needed break from pogo as of right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,a part of me thinks that niantic labs are actually made up of south park characters jumping around high fiving each other for doing such a great job and giggling about how clever their update messages are basically a sequel to the chinpokomon episode john hanke played by randy stan kyle and kenny are frustrated gamers rolling their eyes at these updates but heading out to hatch spearows in the snow anyway cartman is munchlax being introduced to pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,now we know why pikachu pulls out the plug
TheSilphRoad,removed,be sure to drink your ovaltine
TheSilphRoad,removed,now watch as redditors struggle to find a way to cast this in a negative light since the increased spawns im always out of pokéballs niantic sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,just thank you niantic we have spoofer here who isnt baned after more request my and friends he spoof here daily but this spawn make smile on my face thx niantic best message after months
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is why it got downvoted funny guy looking for points
TheSilphRoad,removed,then make an official apology and enough said
TheSilphRoad,removed,gen for the summer hopefully gen in the new year
TheSilphRoad,removed,my area is still dead as always why you do this niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,in urbanrural area the number of pokestop is more critical issue
TheSilphRoad,removed,i stopped playing months ago its sad because the game might have had potential but its dead to me besides damn near melts my battery with all the noise calculations
TheSilphRoad,removed,the wording on this is funny it makes it seem like its a surprise even to them their tweet tomorrow morning says something like the following yesterday we noticed an unintended increase in pokemon spawning this has since been fixed
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have more rattata yay
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just wanted to battle the damn pokemon in wild battles damn u nintendo i will hate u forever for taking this away from us goodluck in pokemon go for rectifying your selfish blunders
TheSilphRoad,removed,its done by a scanner see rpokemongodev
TheSilphRoad,removed,why did you post this here
TheSilphRoad,removed,at the bottom of the page is a link to their open source project httpsgithubcombrusselopoleworldopole
TheSilphRoad,removed,and
TheSilphRoad,removed,i use drones
TheSilphRoad,removed,go away
TheSilphRoad,removed,but niantic has banned all root users didnt that solve the issue completely without alienating any genuine users s
TheSilphRoad,removed,definitely the sort of thing that should have been caught with unit and regression testing pretty embarrassing for it to be so obviously and immediately bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,disclaimer this is breaking niantics tos a few cities have them and you can set up your own httpbrusselopolebeworldopole
TheSilphRoad,removed,but every time a pokemon levels up their other stats increase
TheSilphRoad,removed,bot mystic players will have no problem as they are specialized in keeping mons with above certain iv and transfer out those did not make the cut and they catch of pokemon each day
TheSilphRoad,removed,if youre on android pokescanner finds nearby pokemon and gyms in real time
TheSilphRoad,removed,cant we use to discern biomes obviously wed need to pour more resources in it so we get a worldwide heatmap
TheSilphRoad,removed,the ones that are crowdsourced like pokeradar using user reports are fine but some still make ones that use actual go account and pull data so those ones arent all gone so any app that works like those ones that log in with their own accounts those are breaking tos whether or not they can tie it back to you if its all user input thats another story but that wont be live or in real time unless each gym has someone actively watching it every minute
TheSilphRoad,removed,another shameless self promotion assuming everyone uses lucky eggs just for pidgey evolving doesnt even leave link to this calculator possibly isnt aware the math is doable with any regular calculator
TheSilphRoad,removed,jeez i didnt expect to open an autobiography
TheSilphRoad,removed,no thats about right i evolved a eevee to a vape
TheSilphRoad,removed,been playing longer than of this sub hes right its been like that since the field test
TheSilphRoad,removed,evolve first this is almost always better from my understanding why because of the move change and potential iv change that bit is new info and i may be wrong
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey i think your conclusions are wrong based in the data the dump that its posted in pastebin seems to be message prototypes so the values associated to each field are just enumerated from onwards are you referring to this snippet message fortsettingsproto double interactionrangemeters maxtotaldeployedpokemon maxplayerdeployedpokemon double deploystaminamultiplier double deployattackmultiplier double farinteractionrangemeters the double in attributes deploystaminamultiplier and deployattackmultiplier stand for double precision float numbers httpsenwikipediaorgwikidoubleprecisionfloatingpointformat
TheSilphRoad,removed,op is a filthy casual
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly the gym and battling system is so bad that whats even the point of minmaxing for one theres absolutely no benefit to holding a gym at all you make your daily collection and thats it you get nothing else youre better off just attacking for the xp new day comes just quickly take over a gym and collect again then move on until they change gyms and change the gimmicky tapping battle system i wont even bother with combat
TheSilphRoad,removed,itt look i did a thing howd you do it magic but really how can i do this crickets
TheSilphRoad,removed,these updates just keep getting better and better isnt it
TheSilphRoad,removed,as long as our accounts arent linked to activity why in the fuck would the tos matter
TheSilphRoad,removed,indeed
TheSilphRoad,removed,search this has been asked and answered many times
TheSilphRoad,removed,remember talk of ice types spawning at christmas remember presents remember trading remember player vs player fighting remember gen guaranteed for christmas by people like trainer tips lol at this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,top ten ways pokemon go smashed the gamergate patriarchy
TheSilphRoad,removed,go to rpokemongo for speculation
TheSilphRoad,removed,more hats on more pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,infinite amounts of freaking speculation
TheSilphRoad,removed,says the guy who puts xd at the end of his comment
TheSilphRoad,removed,ehhh maybe game statistician community organizers of the year i havent seen any gameplay from either
TheSilphRoad,removed,but its kotaku
TheSilphRoad,removed,heh remember when there was a most hardcore gamer of the year competition thing in at alcatraz
TheSilphRoad,removed,smaller numbers in themselve are not a reason to exlcude data read this whole thread again buddy i have explained multiple times that this is not the only reason i chose to exclude the data
TheSilphRoad,removed,normally id let this slide but people with a phd shouldnt misspell common words like definitely
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic completely ignores these reports they have no way of knowing if they person in question is actually cheating or if theyre just not somewhere that you can see them or heck if youre just salty they took your spot or whatever
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh we think that about guns then cars skateboards bikes other apps on the phone email your logic is flawed
TheSilphRoad,removed,i would never penalize people for actually playing fair my suggestions is to report them anyway your comments dont seem to reflect this idea
TheSilphRoad,removed,yet another salty player unable to keep gyms blaming it on cheaters and risking ruining the game of innocent people
TheSilphRoad,removed,i reported my own friend with text message conversation proof that he was spoofing and nothing happened
TheSilphRoad,removed,cool story but niantic dont consider cheater reports if you can not see it does not mean that it is not
TheSilphRoad,removed,double candy
TheSilphRoad,removed,incubators are very nice unfortunately this allbutguarentees that we wont see any other new pokemon till after january to be honest this seems like the following communication hi guys we know you really want gen but were not ready yet so instead how about we do all sorts of other unexpected stuff to make your head spin while we do whatever crap we need to do to get this ready i mean we know you realllly want gen butholy cow is that a charblastasauryoud better go catch it
TheSilphRoad,removed,things i would have preferred over the current event double candy double xp decreased buddy distance decreased evolve costs limited time method for move rerolls more limited pokemon like santachu more gen increase ice pokemon option to grind useless candy into stardust double stardust
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah is there anything else you want to have for free maybe free star dust per month
TheSilphRoad,removed,already hatched gen ii pokemon from eggs and use incubators a day where is the rest of gen ii this the worst even
TheSilphRoad,removed,we only have one pokestop and its a minute drive this sucks
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry but this event is a let down youd think christmas would be the biggest event instead we get this meh that would have come with time regardless
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly if they increased the rate of baby smoochum elekid and magby from eggs this is like the antichristmas
TheSilphRoad,removed,imo this event is such a letdown was really hoping for it to be the halloween event minus all those ghost pokemon the first stage is good with the free incubators and increased chances of babies in the and eggs but hate the fact they did it for eggs too the second stage does nothing for me the event has not made me want to play any more than i would normally do like the halloween event did and to a small extent the thanksgiving event i will get my daily incubator and play if i feel like it
TheSilphRoad,removed,probably the day after their quarterly earnings report p
TheSilphRoad,removed,titles a wee bit misleading innit its only just announced right things dont start til the am i reading that right
TheSilphRoad,removed,more wild unbased speculation
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont claim its bad i will enjoy but imo its the worst pokemon go event its not gonna be close halloween event for me
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup sucks no new pokémon
TheSilphRoad,removed,fsuatl ive never heard of him until now i just watched some of his videos wtf is up with his breathing its like he talks himself out of breath and has to gasp for breath reminds me of the band muse haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,i am not a beta tester but i would just like to let you know that none of the moves in this game have status effects of life steal and that every move is solely for doing direct damage
TheSilphRoad,removed,the snark is to highlight how ridiculous it is that niantic after one year and millions of dollars still cant polish up this game i am sure many feel the same way
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic has dropped the ball months and no change to the endgame which was perfunctory at best and amateur at worst the legendaries are nowhere in sight and given the current game still looks miles from being implemented in an interesting unique manner kudos to those that continue but if this current pace of development continues this game will burn out all its supporters by the time any good content rolls around
TheSilphRoad,removed,id say most dedicated players are utterly bored and a bit disappointed if there were at least an announcement about new content coming id be more motivated but right now i only play casually eg in the bus doesnt niantic even care about dropping sales
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a further test can you power your pokemon to lvl when trainer lvl the pokeassistantcom iv checker has that listed as a max so im curious if they discovered something in the code to make them think that perhaps another easter egg
TheSilphRoad,removed,maple syrup
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a play on the word milf and the pokemon slowbro
TheSilphRoad,removed,found another one thats never played pokémon
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its getting them into pokémon go which is a spinoff and doesnt count as a real pokémon game
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is red may never die
TheSilphRoad,removed,ask your mom
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy downvotes for a simple statement i feel like im on rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,they dont develop the game on cell phones
TheSilphRoad,removed,really like who the f cares we get to know stuff thats what matters not how people call the method to get there someone really has too much time on hand
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe in the us but how can we have not been beaten by the asian gamers i mean youve all heard how they literally kill binging on games
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can use to do mass evolve though
TheSilphRoad,removed,guys with girl characters smh
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont forget that belittling the devs and using multiple cusswords also helps them listen s
TheSilphRoad,removed,and some stabilisers to stop you falling off when cycling slow enough to hatch eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,concern trolling alert wheres your thoughts about eating and driving cell phone use of any flavor talking to passengers let alone dealing with babies those things kill people yet you dont care pathetic
TheSilphRoad,removed,you wont be able to play unless youre going at a walking pace
TheSilphRoad,removed,this post needs to be in rpokemongo not in this very safe and productive subreddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,bulldoze is beyond salvation lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,my clock is automatic always has been i also signed out times and signed back in oh and i cleared the apps cache too that was for the first incense which resulted in nothing the second incense i lit spawned a single rhyhorn which ran after the first catch nothing else no amount of walking up and down the rainy street fully signing out closing the window hardstarting the app up timesonly when i sat down on the couch in grumpiness did that single rhyhorn spawnwhich ran away like i said after the first ball and catchit was not even a nice cp and i normally always hit with a curve ball and nice or great lets not forget the really shitty spawn rates happening after this last trashupdate either the rate dropped significantly or they fucked up their tracker so badly it is not registering spawns most of the time in fact i have had pokemon spawn on screen and not even show up on the nearby list i have had nice pokemon i tap on suddenly magically be replaced by motherloving pidgeys the best fuckups are when i have desired pokemon spawn within reach yet when i tap on themi get the horseshit spinning loading ball of doom until it times out into the red error tab with that pokemon disappearing even with signing out signing back inwaiting for that pokemon to respawn and retapping that pokemon to initiate the catch screeni have had the same bullshit happen this happens only with the better pokemonyet the damn caterpie or pidgey that is actually farther away no problem on clicking and initiating the catchscreen btw all pokemon that had that spinning ball of doom error message just spawned so it was not an incidence of despawningtiming out i have also had good pokemon that i was already in a catchfight with and i had invested significant balls and berries inand then have a situation where my pokegreatultraball hit the second rolland the game would freeze and stay that way for at least a minute before i am suddenly back on the map screen with the same goddamn red tab error message no refunds or credits for the lost resources and no replacing the lost pokemononly the standard robobullshit email given after you send a report
TheSilphRoad,removed,all kinds of nope
TheSilphRoad,removed,why are people so insistent on forcing their naming scheme on everyone else everyone has their own system
TheSilphRoad,removed,here have a cookie
TheSilphRoad,removed,you idea was and still stupid for anyone with any skill old system was better
TheSilphRoad,removed,the change is a very bad one
TheSilphRoad,removed,your idea has passed everyone off
TheSilphRoad,removed,the hard part is doing that without banning all of the nonspoofers for instance people who just hopped off of a train and want to kill some time with the game while waiting for the next one or people whose gps just decided to freak out and make it look like they were running at when theyre actually sitting in a starbucks with a coffee and it wouldnt stop spoofers anyway theyd just reduce the speed that their apps automatically walk them to the next gym im already about sick of being a casualty in the war between niantic and spoofers without them making it even worse
TheSilphRoad,removed,and i blame hillary p but both of our accusations are completely irrelevant and pointless
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think someone did a detailed anaylsis on it somewhere in this sub
TheSilphRoad,removed,you didnt get bulldoze thats a good arcanine
TheSilphRoad,removed,my last have been onix onix eevee both onix hatched together im starting to think its karma catching up with me for having already hatched snorlax previously
TheSilphRoad,removed,keenankj goes around in a large group of adults in aalborg after most nights they each use multiple accounts with different teams to magikarpmagnemite boost the gyms to level then remove their own magikarps with an alternate account they have about gyms in the middle of town and the kids in the area have lost a whole dimmension of playing based purely on these year olds my own kids included
TheSilphRoad,removed,can confirm with extremely high certainty your frequent rare spawn data is absolutely true and not a statistical anomaly i live in suburbs of boston outside of this track range so just frequently checked pokegoboston from afar to try to observe where the best rare hunting spots might be and observed the top super rares meaning the pokemon people want lapras snorlax dragonite ect repeatedly spawning in the literal exact same spots every day pokeboston made this easy to see as the rares appear larger on the map see example screenshot i also used the tracker one day at castle island and the rares i did see spawned exactly where the circles on your rare frequency map are
TheSilphRoad,removed,same here reporting is not only useless since you cant actually offer evidence they spoofed unless you incidently had a video cam with you and filmed both the game and the area around the gym but just as badsporting as spoofing is i say just show them how weak they are and itll stop soon enough
TheSilphRoad,removed,flygps spoofers are getting away with it
TheSilphRoad,removed,interesting what about the brown ones
TheSilphRoad,removed,well contributing to getting the cheater banned would help me but regardless i hardly see how reporting clear cases of cheating make someone a bad sport in any way
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep one of my guys disappeared for a bit i assume banned and then came back when they lifted the ban but now he is back i make it my duty to kick him out of gyms when i see him ill be damned if he collects the two gyms near me i reported him again but he is still around ive also reported another one and theyre still rampant no point reporting anymore
TheSilphRoad,removed,look in the mirror and you will see one
TheSilphRoad,removed,i mean if reporting helps the person alleviate or have a presumption that they are doing something let them i only play now to collect coins and stay relevant smh
TheSilphRoad,removed,the courts told me otherwise
TheSilphRoad,removed,and the most important mode cant catch anything if you are on a bus a car passenger or simply riding your bike too fast
TheSilphRoad,removed,you will get raped eventually one dark alley is all it takes dont walk alone
TheSilphRoad,removed,we did it travelers you can go home now rotfl
TheSilphRoad,removed,rip
TheSilphRoad,removed,possible yes as almost everything in the universe probable no
TheSilphRoad,removed,its killed the game entirely for me i work full time and bus to and from work the bus regularly goes above the limit and therefore nothing shows up its where i play the vast majority of the time im from sudbury ontario sudbury it km² with there being around maybe pokestops in the whole city most of which arent close together the weather is rainy and cold with snow on the way so already im having to spend money on pokeballs due to the lack of stops and weather and now im not able to play the game on the bus rides tracking iswasalways going to be an issue with how baron spread out and large the city is being able to pull up a map and plan a route to walk was vital on days off the sf tracker would not work here ive said it before and ill say it again they are not responsible and as far as i can tell cant be held liable for distracted driving if this were the case you would see other apps facebook angry birds messengers whatever limit your ability to use the app while moving distracted driving is against the law doesnt matter what youre doing on the device just that youre using the device the cop doesnt ask what app you were using and then write you the ticket niantic gladly took my money and changed core gameplay
TheSilphRoad,removed,is the game suppose to be played sitting down near lures for at least hours a day where the weather is nice all year round with no subzero temperatures
TheSilphRoad,removed,my heart sank when i started up pogo this morning bubblerlivesmatter
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you delusional im talking about the features they highlighted in the video butthurt much
TheSilphRoad,removed,no its very much still alive and well and game breaking thanks for asking the most effective way to do bubblestrat nowadays is to make sure youre looking at your phone the entire time while walking into oncoming traffic
TheSilphRoad,removed,the same people that would be playing and driving will be the same people doing something else while driving whether that be reading a book looking at facebook or instagram for the rest of us responsible people this is like putting diapers on people who are clearly potty trained my daughter would play on the way to school and on the way home from school now she will have to use virtually any other app her and the plethora of users that are passengers can just suffer because of a few dumb asses out there that would chose to be stupid regardless of media to be consumed while driving
TheSilphRoad,removed,this has made the plus device almost completely useless for me the main reason i bought the plus was so i could catch pokemon and spin pokestops without using my phone while driving trying to be safe and still get punished waste of money i guess ill just have to drive under mph no matter what road im on now if you see a slow driver blame niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,one of those i get offended from sarcastic jokes on the internet people grow up httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcesjkkjigo
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes i dont need them to spawn i just need the sightings back i need to know where to pull over and park to get out and hunt because im an ultrarural in a town of people and just as many cows and cornfields and my nearest pokestop and gym are miles from my house nearest ones beyond that are miles there are two spawns that i know of between my house and that nearest pokestop but basically there is no playing without driving to get to a place we can play usually that is into the nearest small town where we can park at either end of town to hunt or near the center or along the river or in the historic cemetery with the area open to the public so no worries of hurting the old roads in the main cemetery area or anything with pokemon go traffic we have to pull over here wait look go again pull over a few miles further look go again etc it soudns easy but its a small historic town without parking along the sides of the roads and mostly residential so nowhere to pull over until you get to one end of town or another unless you know to slow down and wind your way to an offroads parking lot or whatever not to mention the fact my kids can no longer play from the back seat while i run errands and that is dumb of niantic because im sure a lot of with much younger kids than mine would pay for incense to keep their kids quiet and content on longer car trips for example if they could use them our rural areas town area is and going slower just holds up traffic because it was a small town with small roads built a long time ago that has a bigger amount of people and cars now than it can handle if someone is going in a all the way through town you know and the residential areas outside that are so forget about it kids cant play at home because there are no spawns pokestops or gyms for miles cant play in the car or on the school bus cant play at school because theyre at schoolno phones allowed at school anyway here my daughter quit a bit ago already and now my sons getting pretty frustrated since you asked
TheSilphRoad,removed,im not even sure why this is the problem with niantic they arent communicating with players
TheSilphRoad,removed,dammit niantic screwed us over again
TheSilphRoad,removed,select a nearby pokemon that doesnt happen in the video then add a compass also not in the video a distance away tracker they show tracking distance so you got out of right there but like the tracker itll probably kill their servers with the excess serverload who cares though right technical limits be damned you should get everything promised in this video that is clearly not a representation of actual game play damn niantic and their false advertising
TheSilphRoad,removed,judging from ingress events probably not lmao would be nice if they at least worded it differently to be very clear that it lasts at least till this point and tell us to follow their twitter where they will tweet updates on an official end time once we pass this point that way we still get a few extra hours while also gettin an hour or two warning that its actually endning thats probably also too much work for them though
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been a grind reading through all these useless posts
TheSilphRoad,removed,the event is over
TheSilphRoad,removed,farfetchd is kinda a joke that he isnt available in like of asia just salty about having no exclusive
TheSilphRoad,removed,its so hard to not facepalm when reading this
TheSilphRoad,removed,no biome for chansey is known no one can help you facepalms away
TheSilphRoad,removed,hey id just be happy if the app worked as intended more of the time i am so sick of logging in and all the pokestops are missing and there are no pokemon around due to server or app stability issues i assume it is so frustrating to log in and log out repeatedly to get the game to even work at least on ios ugh
TheSilphRoad,removed,well god damn here have an upvote tear
TheSilphRoad,removed,can we please also tone down this ridiculous limit on being able to interact with pokemon and pokestops above a certain speed i get not wanting let people shortcut egg hatching but as a passenger on a shuttle or a bus i can no longer do anything during my morning commute related to this game it was my primary way to refill my supplies i have a busy schedule if the game isnt going to let me play it during the time i have allotted im not going to carve out additional time to play it i simply wont play
TheSilphRoad,removed,no sit sherlock maybe i should have phrased better chansey is the main reason why max potions are useful
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks for sharing your thoughts im not going to go and comment on every single one of these because at the end of the day its pointless its just completely pointless because neither of us will change each others minds gen was your least favorite generation but its one of my favorites so be it heres what we can agree upon the monkeys are awful and should never have been created drilbur dwebble joltik and larvesta evolution lines are great archeops is cool gen legendaries are pretty mediocre my biggest disagreements there were only grassbug types before leavanny dont see how its overdone at all scolipede is amazing and i dont care what you say about it i really like sigilyph its so alien and bizarre in a charming way ultimately its a design choice on where we differ some of the pokemon you criticize are very similar to their predecessors and others only share a single similarity like typing or general concept you see this as boring rehashing i just see it as more variety you wont really be satisfied unless a new pokemon has a unique typing and a design that is subjectively unique to you and even then it may not appeal to you
TheSilphRoad,removed,chansey is nearly impossible to prestige against with any pokémon except dragonite and im not a cheater so i have no alt to switch to
TheSilphRoad,removed,great to know guys i feel like an ass for jumping to players be hacking but im glad i got the facts straight now thanks everyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,snarky remark telling us others people have a life besides of being in here implies we dont have lives thats an insult and doesnt win you any points jerk real answer why dont you just walk your existing chansey
TheSilphRoad,removed,how could niantic think this is a good idea after months of testing
TheSilphRoad,removed,😂😂😂 this is the best thing i have read all day
TheSilphRoad,removed,you forgot i never used a scanner walked a day and have pokemon in gyms at all times
TheSilphRoad,removed,ist you a mod canst you maketh such a declaration
TheSilphRoad,removed,touché
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just hope this is not an attempt to shut down fastpokemaps
TheSilphRoad,removed,sweet i still cant play on my rooted phone d
TheSilphRoad,removed,how useful s
TheSilphRoad,removed,sun and moon is coming out maybe thats more up your alley
TheSilphRoad,removed,if you arent happy with what we have take a small break or years might be enough time
TheSilphRoad,removed,yea us im innocent andm until h h fb this you know yeibc endjjnxi
TheSilphRoad,removed,i expected them to keep tracking in the game not give me constant nag screens and to not make the game unplayable to bus and train riders
TheSilphRoad,removed,man this game was so horrendous until the eggs had color and patterns that ment something thank you niantic for keeping me inerested
TheSilphRoad,removed,pretty useless update a slight graphical fix doesnt fix a tracker listen to your community niantic ugh
TheSilphRoad,removed,hes not sharing it publicly for exactly the reasons youre concerned about
TheSilphRoad,removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikitechnologyroadmap
TheSilphRoad,removed,me oh pokemongo update maybe they finally fixed the tracker niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i look at the game and just get pissed and bored at the same time please fix the bads add some actually cool features and get one with it niantic must have enough profits to make this happen
TheSilphRoad,removed,professor willow is a parallel for niantic willow niantic has been spending his time from launch making millions and millions of pidgey candies money and instead of putting that towards actual discoveries development the only thing he can show for it is a very underwhelming discovery update which is purely a cosmetic change minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think thats probably when ill officially stop playing not like now where i play for a few minutes a day
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup every feature they add is like a suggestion from this subreddit but made useless
TheSilphRoad,removed,im pretty sure its just saying eggs will have one pattern eggs another and eggs yet another so you know at a glance which one youve just received
TheSilphRoad,removed,wasnt someone supposed to release a hack today the update is probably about defending against that the rest is just what they were able to include to justify the update
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont forget how everyone was clamoring for the pokemon type icons it was such a pain figuring out the pokemon type before you had to read words so time consuming many letters to decipher hurt my brain and now its so easy this game is getting better every day i literally cant think of anything else they couldve improved what a glorious day
TheSilphRoad,removed,i also think this feature is just to hide the fact that they are only updating cause fpm just came back up cause i would call this an update just feel like they they it in to justify the update to block maps again
TheSilphRoad,removed,its so much more than just disappointment at this point
TheSilphRoad,removed,until they make the gym icon on a defender pokemons info screen into a button i am confident they are not paying us attention
TheSilphRoad,removed,like minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,idk zoroark is pretty far off gen wise
TheSilphRoad,removed,meanwhile at niantic yesterday put down your smashed avocado bagels and listen up we need to show the consumers that we are listening communicating and continuing to improve one of you needs to come up with a new egg distraction pronto and a way to make the pogo use its battery faster lets also re arrange the catch rate mechanics now that they have solved it and call it minor text fixes bwahahahah the rest of you keep working on operation map breaker theres still to much functionality in our client and people are solving their pokedexes to fast
TheSilphRoad,removed,most of those bad changes were applied server side not through patches
TheSilphRoad,removed,i look at the game while driving more now that there is a speed lock niantic doesnt care about making people safer they care about looking like they care about making people safer
TheSilphRoad,removed,another lines of code written in two weeks whoooooooo
TheSilphRoad,removed,you know what it wont be anything promised in the beta videos
TheSilphRoad,removed,another update i have to download from a third party website because niantic has the balls to not release it for the whole world at the same time
TheSilphRoad,removed,so re texture on egs per distance icons on pokemon info screen no tracker nothing good no comments on stability either
TheSilphRoad,removed,spotted john hanke
TheSilphRoad,removed,the same argument can be made for alcohol it impairs your driving ability can cause accidents and lives have been lost but are the alcohol companies responsible for the drivers action when they choose to drink and drive if the companies didnt make the drink then the people wouldnt be drinking and driving in the first place with the new limits it is like you are sober driving home your drunk friend and get pulled over and stuck with a dui cause some one in the vehicle was intoxicated while driving the plan is to reduce impaired people driving in cars but the application is ridiculous like wise with niantics new restrictions they are making the game more unplayable each update but hey at least the eggs have different patterns now
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant understand why they couldnt do these things faster to keep more players
TheSilphRoad,removed,nice weeks worth of content i guess
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can be as pedantic about it as you want bottom line is this is still a bad update this is the largest change in this update and nobody had a thought about doing anything differently so that color blind people could use this its sloppy and it would be easy to fix
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats not useless bloat at all
TheSilphRoad,removed,wait the icons above the pokemon types are what they have added this update is even more useless than i have though i thought there would be small icons on each image in the list of pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,can anyone confirm if it happens when evolving as well niantic gives you seconds less evolution animation and then takes away for loading pokemon that would exactly be niantic way of work
TheSilphRoad,removed,this fix will probably be the major update in weeks
TheSilphRoad,removed,that was pretty much the only useful thing i saw in this update knowing if you got a or egg without having to open the eggs its like niantic are trying to get hate
TheSilphRoad,removed,so theyre changing the color of the eggs but not addressing the real issue of getting all eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks nianitc i would have never quite this game if it was not for the different colors of these three eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,my guess is they are working on removing pokemon since some people complained that they are upset they missed out some some rare ones because of the lack of tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,just use pogo r
TheSilphRoad,removed,professor willow discovered needs some flair in his animation
TheSilphRoad,removed,with the buddy candy bonus does that mean well effectively have a more accurate buddy distance tracker s
TheSilphRoad,removed,minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,removed,ugh those are all terrible
TheSilphRoad,removed,that screen could be a mass of jumbled letters numbers and images and i wouldnt care less if we had decent in game tracking
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is lazy and uninspired who cares to catch more zubat ooo spooky
TheSilphRoad,removed,good that fpm is back gonna unt those pokes like
TheSilphRoad,removed,how will i ever contain my excitement
TheSilphRoad,removed,finally niantic does something great
TheSilphRoad,removed,really where is the reddit speed lock if they really want to prevent people from playing while driving they should make it a pc program instead of a mobile app
TheSilphRoad,removed,well aint that just awesome sarcasm
TheSilphRoad,removed,so if im following the patternmeme i should complain that the latest update is a blatant cash grab that literally ruins the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,i transferred today never mind
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was talking about the seven pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,but you get colored eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats my point about it being because i figured apple didnt allow a beta or version number under fuck john hanke hes running the game into the ground he worked on google maps he doesnt know shit about making a proper video game
TheSilphRoad,removed,anyone would be able to get them so why would i care beyond filling the dex entry youll have to figure this long rant but i just dont feel like regional pokemon make sense and any value they have is based on artificial scarcity due to the size of the globe rather than anything in particular about the pokemon why should anyone care about them besides a pokedex entry as it is when they presumably add trading thats all people will want them for no one is going to want multiples there is also nothing difficult about catching a regional if you are in the right location why do people in those locations get something to hold over people who happen to live on the wrong continent why are americans entitled to tauros and south america isnt it doesnt make sense to me its not a fair system and the only value to these pokemon offer is a pokedex entry why would it be a terrible thing if those in other countries had a chance to get them even for one day how is that a bad thing who cares if the perceived value of these pokemon is reduced when their only value is a pokedex entry you still get your pokedex entry we already have difficult to find pokemon without having the total cock block that is regional pokemon people arent finding grimers or porygons left and right you can still have those hard to find pokemon to show off to your friends if most people were sitting at completed there might be some argument for having really hard to obtain in odd location pokemon but thats not the case right now regionals are for international students and people wealthy enough to travel across the world personally i hate the idea that if i plan a vacation to another country that i might feel obligated to play pokemon go when id rather actually see the site not stare at a broken tracker
TheSilphRoad,removed,stack eggs now transfer nothing until wednesday and then walk walk walk incubate everything other than limits incubators on at all times rake in candy try to get in two mass evolves
TheSilphRoad,removed,its probably going down to mph now
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes it would be nice to have more than one of those again as a free player full disclosure i would buy some stuff from this game if i actually felt like niantic was going to complete it but theyre too busy counting money
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously why cant this company put together half decent patch notes though
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah theres plenty they should add obviously but from what ive seen since launch so far it is not worth my money yet i cant financially support a game that is so woefully incomplete these arent up and coming devs on steam or kickstarter who actually need the money to finance the game niantic is a bunch of billionaires by now
TheSilphRoad,removed,if they had a qa team they would have found it
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive never noticed it but it could have always been there i suppose
TheSilphRoad,removed,just because youve drank the koolaid doesnt mean it wasnt made with piss
TheSilphRoad,removed,standards what standards this sub allows the same shitty screenshot posts with a sob story about spoofers or some story about their kids that nobody cares about this sub is just rpokemongo with a different name
TheSilphRoad,removed,see this is the sort of bravery that reddit needs we cant allow people to get away with such atrocities as using url shorteners no we need to go cry to the admins immediately to protect the innocent children
TheSilphRoad,removed,is you agreeing with me some kind of retarded bot strategy this is not making any sense
TheSilphRoad,removed,you probably sit while you pee
TheSilphRoad,removed,too little too late for this app
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop
TheSilphRoad,removed,so im gonna turn with a great smile and walk my white ass back across mile
TheSilphRoad,removed,umbreon will maxhp of and maxcp of
TheSilphRoad,removed,completely agree theres nothing to talk about because this game has gameplay depth
TheSilphRoad,removed,guyse chekc out my funy screnshot no more
TheSilphRoad,removed,this sub quality is falling down a lot i agree
TheSilphRoad,removed,hate to say it but game is pretty dead right now and theres not much to discuss im lvl with full na pokedex living in suburb with nearly impossible tracking system gyms are too easy to take down so little point in presaging up the gyms basically nothing to do hopefully the new christmas event will add some excitement
TheSilphRoad,removed,keep buying incubators niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,i call bs on your life
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are going to hate hitmonchan
TheSilphRoad,removed,you need a life
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow in a couple of weeks i totally believe you did that legit not reported for botting and spoofing
TheSilphRoad,removed,its so weird and unfair that lapras spawns have decreasedstopped worldwide a group of dedicated pogo players in melbourne generously hosted an event last saturday to light up a beach pier hotspot ie placed lures on all pokestops from this spot is a known lapras spawning area probably more than people showed up and many people were there specifically for lapras you could tell by everyone talking about lapras and asking if one had spawned there was no lapras and i assume that many people went home disappointed this is just a small anecdote to show that a lot of people even in just one city let alone the world can be negatively affected by a worldwide spawn decrease for a particular pokemon it adds insult to injury knowing that during our laprasless melbourne event people in those japan regions would be finding lapras a day its great that those regions are getting more tourists and hopefully its having a net positive outcome given the costs of organising the event but niantic needs to start treating their players fairly
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup i am positive my local nest changed before my eyes so i checked the others on pokeradar they have shifted
TheSilphRoad,removed,not in a rude way but why is there a tracker in japan as in whats stopping it from happeneing elsewhere
TheSilphRoad,removed,japan seems like such a fun place to play i wish the us was like it
TheSilphRoad,removed,its accepted you f u c k i n g r e t a r d
TheSilphRoad,removed,what scanner is being used on httpiimgurcomidzvlkujpg link
TheSilphRoad,removed,they have this really great thing called a search bar
TheSilphRoad,removed,or maybe just make the app detect fake gps apps in the phone and permaban everyone using them
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive seen one level myself
TheSilphRoad,removed,it is sad but with niantic doing anything about it the only possible option is create an alternative account and kick out the spoofer with other spoofer account
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic isnt doing crap to stop spoofers theyve been around since the beginning
TheSilphRoad,removed,wow then its even worse than i expected im kind of done anyway pokedex finished have my top team with high iv and the only thing left to do is fighting spoofers while standing outside at c
TheSilphRoad,removed,is that supposed to be a logical conclusion sorry to burst your bubble but not everything that is said and condoned on reddit is morally valid far from it
TheSilphRoad,removed,i run a pokemon mapping site whats the site i thought all of the mapping sites got shut down in recent updates
TheSilphRoad,removed,why dont you show a first seen time for each pokemon on the tracker that way the user can know if they will get there in time assuming a minute spawn
TheSilphRoad,removed,so why are local radar sites still providing spawn timers for minutes and why is it accurate
TheSilphRoad,removed,make the regionals nonregional pls give us free items allow pokemon per gym
TheSilphRoad,removed,perfect spoof photoshop is your friend
TheSilphRoad,removed,scam really dont be that guy
TheSilphRoad,removed,sure you travelled neutral im sorry but i think this it totally against the whole pokémon idea protecting the rare species in our world vote me down im getting used to it lately this game is about walking
TheSilphRoad,removed,im prepared for the downvotes here because i dont give a crap ive lost all trust i never had any to begin with though and predicted this outcome to be honest i live in japan this guy thought hed be able to just do this last minute trip with no prior planning and only cad riiight it was clearly obvious this was destined to fail the moment he said he was setting up a gofundme page i knew it was going to get worse and that gofundme page are you kidding me i dont think ive seen so much arrogance ill be the bridge no you wont dude not with in which he indicated that he wants overrun costs how much exactly even if he says hes donating to charity i highly doubt that he lost his moment im sorry about his niece but like i could not detect any real feelings at all in the few short paragraphs he wrote and it sounds like hes just using the sob story as a cover up to front his mistakes if i was a tsunami survivor id be pissed reading that its a disservice to those affected by the disaster instead of linking to the organizations which he shouldve done hes linking to his sob story that i dont even know is true things he should do before he embarrasses himself further delete the gofundme page post his entire story to reddit instead or some other platform not request any money whatsoever post links to cancerdisaster charities if he wants
TheSilphRoad,removed,first worth reading idea ive seen here
TheSilphRoad,removed,legitimate if you state why
TheSilphRoad,removed,i still believe that theres an autospawning program thats always running as well as a manual spawner that interns use so they can laugh at hundreds of people running across parks for dratinis
TheSilphRoad,removed,but doesnt seem fully inclusive
TheSilphRoad,removed,i just spent my second pokecoins on a second bag upgrade took like weeks but thats the life
TheSilphRoad,removed,goes to thechivecom
TheSilphRoad,removed,lack of weakness does lots of damage to everything thats fantastic for gym defense remember your defender is only as good as the best thing that can attack it so being pretty good vs everything is great
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can create one by modifying pokemon go map easily
TheSilphRoad,removed,you obviously live near a major highway or a stop with major cellular axtivity
TheSilphRoad,removed,get a better phone or a powerbank
TheSilphRoad,removed,if i had know i couldve front paged with this i wouldve posted it
TheSilphRoad,removed,its been common knowledge for a while fuckface
TheSilphRoad,removed,your wrong and fucken stuped
TheSilphRoad,removed,what the fuck ive seen two jynx so far one from my girlfriends incense while walking by the sea and another from an egg have you just hatched a bunch from eggs
TheSilphRoad,removed,no shoot sherlock
TheSilphRoad,removed,and lets not forget even the best fearow is worthless
TheSilphRoad,removed,well good to know our most common pokemon were left in place why on earth not change the most common pokemon for everyone bleh
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,its dead because updates like this should have come months ago along with features which were removed just never being fixed
TheSilphRoad,removed,ill take genuine thoughts on the game over the forced positivity this sorry excuse for a sub enforces
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats what i keep thinking everytime i see a post from here on my page i think who cares then i remember my dumbass is subscribed to here still even though i stopped time to go do it this time lol call me when that tracker fixed boys
TheSilphRoad,removed,is diversity ruining pokémon go make pokémon go great again
TheSilphRoad,removed,if the game had a decent content update for every time this was suggested then it would be like a whole new game several times over already
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes lets inconvenience legit players even more and bots not at all and for you downvoters who dont understand the captcha is easily solved by bot programs and spoofers wont encounter it any more than a legit player will
TheSilphRoad,removed,its another aspect of niantics security theatre it irritates real players and does nothing to even slow cheaters down
TheSilphRoad,removed,you can thank the muh trackers people for this
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh another thread complaining about gyms and wanting easier coins for being bad
TheSilphRoad,removed,welcome to your first pokémon go subreddit
TheSilphRoad,removed,viruses from minecraft stuff wat
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh okay i didnt read the comments just answered the question and youre sure its the exact egg you incubated for example if you have km eggs but you only hatch one at a time that doesnt necessarily mean that the last egg on your list was the most recent one you received but if you incubate everything that you receive it soon as you get it then once again i have no answer
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are a liar
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i havent even seen one while scanning with tracking apps started the game the first day starting to think theyre a myth and everyone who has one cheated haha
TheSilphRoad,removed,nobody likes you george
TheSilphRoad,removed,tsr does not have an official policy on scanners last i knew typically they refer it to pogodev when they see it i think you are jelly about double lapras like i am
TheSilphRoad,removed,do you buy your tampons on amazon too
TheSilphRoad,removed,except you can have a game which caters to casuals still have a huge hardcore following league of legends has cute skinscolorsanimations non ranked play fun game modes catering to casual players while also being one of the most watched competitive esport in the past few years they dont need to kill off hardcore players in order to cater to casuals they need to rethink their roadmap or get a wider range of opinions from beta testers
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,of course niantic did nothing to address those and condoned bots without banning them with a stupid popup of course this will make legit people switch to cheating all they get is a popup why bothering getting out in the cold to conquer a gym when you can get random gyms from around the world and nobody will say anything rant
TheSilphRoad,removed,holy shit no wonder that poliwrath was so tough yesterday
TheSilphRoad,removed,where the fuck do you get chansey candies ive only hatched one ever from eggs seriously the past three months all my eggs have been scythers onix hitmonlees and pinsirs its been forever since ive got anything remotely good from them and im worried ill actually have to start walking the chansey i hatched five days after i first started playing at level for reference im level to ever evolve blissey
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think thats more of a rpokemongostories material
TheSilphRoad,removed,i actually feel as if i am going to need chemo therapy from the amount of cancer this is extruding
TheSilphRoad,removed,almost a lot of progress through eggs down have candies charmeleon charizard machamp weezing lapras hitmonchan dragonite kabutops omastar
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe if you dig deeper into the story you could understand how new players might effect game mechanics or you could just give the guy a break dont be a post nazi
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantic are horeshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah this all started for me with this last update just another reason not to open the app
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i think the players who only see and dont understand greatly underestimate how much work dominating a town worth of gyms actually is bubblestrat made it ridiculously easy we constantly said it was pathetic how easy it was to boost gyms to thanks to it anyone with multiple bubble defenders could too easily rebuild an entire kingdom of gyms in an hour with it without this get a group of and go rampage on those dominant players gyms for a night and see how long it takes them to rebuild their empire the poster above you doesnt understand how easy it really is to topple a gym if you just put some effort into it but rather than try they just whine and complain till its handed to them at the cost of ruining the game for everyone else but them we are already bracing for the wave of complaints that it takes too long to get to level and expect fully niantic to drop the exp total to or something after we spent months of daily grinding to get there after playing countless mmo style games im used to the casualsruineverything cycle by now though
TheSilphRoad,removed,we should be team bangbabies
TheSilphRoad,removed,educate them dont bring them to class
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn spoofer hopefully youll get banned hehe
TheSilphRoad,removed,apparently man and male are two different things now s
TheSilphRoad,removed,damn spoofer hopefully youll get banned hehe
TheSilphRoad,removed,cause another aspergers flare up
TheSilphRoad,removed,some special snowflake probably wanted seconds of fame
TheSilphRoad,removed,no i have the very first iphone you dolt
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate when i run low on balls but i always like to keep two great balls in hand just in case
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah you think that then you try an android emulator on your pc and discover you had stockholm syndrome
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont feel too good lol me and my girlfriend both picked up a perfect karp in the wild cp hp havent evolved yet sadly but high iv karps are everywhere lvl
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh shit so a rattata is in the top percentage of rattas good to know
TheSilphRoad,removed,why will it be ruined are you seriously asking why competitive multiplayer will be ruined by cheating gyms are already being dominated by highlevel botters and sniped by spoofers who are miles away if you cant grasp how that will destroy trading and player vs player then youre beyond my help
TheSilphRoad,removed,ive uninstalled the app im not going to play till the three step issue is fixed or we actually get some communication from the developer considering going as far as to write a letter email to nintendo just to get them to kick niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,you are just getting the short end of the rng stick crank through your eggs using your infinity incubator to make more room and just keep hitting pokestops until you get one with your luck youll probably get an eevee with your first and only egg ive hatched and one was a lame ass eevee and the other a useless electabuzz just gotta keep trying for that sweet ass snorlax
TheSilphRoad,removed,access codes
TheSilphRoad,removed,its pm
TheSilphRoad,removed,lets gooooo pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,got itttttt
TheSilphRoad,removed,im in
TheSilphRoad,removed,im in
TheSilphRoad,removed,late
TheSilphRoad,removed,what is it
TheSilphRoad,removed,can i get a code
TheSilphRoad,removed,im sorry didnt realize this was rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,removed,tough shit for rural players this is the game and how it is if they dont like it they need to put in the effort to drive somewhere there are pokemon im in a suburban area but work in the city it sucks out in the burbs but that just means i have to stay in the city after work for a couple hours to keep it stop moaning
TheSilphRoad,removed,i keep getting invalid code
TheSilphRoad,removed,im trying todays code but all it keeps saying is invalid access code
TheSilphRoad,removed,im getting an imvalid access code too
TheSilphRoad,removed,should work
TheSilphRoad,removed,that is true currency has no intrinsic value the value of currency is instilled in it by banks and governments and people pidgeottos have no value because they take candies to evolve while pidgeys take of the same candy to do the exact same thing for the same benefit while also being more readily available
TheSilphRoad,removed,dood omg mewtwos foot is behind that rock its almost like hes actually there
TheSilphRoad,removed,i have a highly desirable pokemon with the ideal move set but i am unsure of and having not read the tutorials am unable to type values into an excel spreadsheet so i would like for the community to tell me ifthat my pokemon has perfect ivs thanks humblebrag
TheSilphRoad,removed,comes along in march
TheSilphRoad,removed,thank you for doing the job that op had
TheSilphRoad,removed,something like httpsgithubcomwolfsblvtblossomspokemongomanagerreleases
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude noobs are casuals they are not below the average they are the average
TheSilphRoad,removed,sounds like the most frustrating and clunky way of implementing this system this is going to be an absolute nightmare of organisation to prestige against level gyms when they have a range of to cp pokémon guess im going to have to rename a lot of the level pokémon id be collecting for the fun of it so i can select teams of or if the maths works out but im not sure i want to be spending ages figuring that out trainers and low cp space fillers this doesnt really seem to make training easier it makes it a difficult maths problem to solve and organisational chore and an even bigger time sink first impression is that im not a fan have to see how it actually works whenever the ios update comes out
TheSilphRoad,removed,yea once we get red up and going after like day some cheap as reds come by use their second account to bust the defender and put theirs in which makes any effort to push those points futile
TheSilphRoad,removed,you sure can you can tap on the greyed out gold medal and it tells you how many
TheSilphRoad,removed,here lets make it even easier to read the confusing bit of nonsense text thatll help
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah it was frustrating before with this is going to be a nightmare
TheSilphRoad,removed,god this is horrible
TheSilphRoad,removed,they would just ignore first and put things under the cp of secondthird
TheSilphRoad,removed,is the tracker still kind of working reading misc posts on another sub that said its shot again
TheSilphRoad,removed,might want to include this on you calc •defending pokemon cp now scales down based on your trainer level if a pokemon is higher level than your trainer its cp will scale down to your trainer level so you need to be aware of what the highest cp for your level can be because thats the highest cp you can go to
TheSilphRoad,removed,i refuse to accept any of these as updates until tracking is improved
TheSilphRoad,removed,too late now they wont touch it for ages their management are real faggts so dont blame them they just want to ruin their own game
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah but no everything that made training up gyms interesting is now gone and got replaced by the mindless bashing that is known from attacking gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,gym stagnation is killing the game here well make it even easier yay
TheSilphRoad,removed,why the fuck are you downvoting me
TheSilphRoad,removed,part of latest changes if it appears on your screen youve seen it
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah much better wording than your rpokemongo post
TheSilphRoad,removed,what drop that chart shows nothing if it shows a drop of server load it could be bit as much as gig there is a reason there is no actual data on the chart provided
TheSilphRoad,removed,no labels no info we have no idea if thats truncated or if they were using a reasonable amount of resources or what that chart is literally useless and the absence of labels is really worrisome since it suggests an attempt to purposely mislead
TheSilphRoad,removed,bringing out the pitchforks and complaining is what spurred them to give updates
TheSilphRoad,removed,i love how they lump what was essentially just pokemon gos version of iitc pokevision in with the botting platforms totally fair they should have used their experience with ingress to figure out exactly what players were going to do to begin with and made a pokemon intel map from the beginning because like it or now theyre now fighting against how the players want the game to work they simply cant win
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hope the reddit admins or niantic can do something to get rid of rpokemongodev and rpokemongotools or at least reduce them by taking those subredits out all theyre doing is completely ruining the game even probably without realizing it up to now and heavily delaying the coming new features which niantic themselves specifically explained im glad i didnt bother using those third party tools whatsoever
TheSilphRoad,removed,the graph looks like drawn in paint lets see how good niantic will be at banning careful spoofers roaming around new york at normal walking speed only hours a day will give much better results than having a jobschool and living well anywhere else and there is money to be made from children as soon as trading comes out which is scary
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont be fooled by the chart it didnt show us whats on the x and y axis and it didnt even show us the axis for all we know it could be a drop in an entire requests bad statistics hurts everyone
TheSilphRoad,removed,found yang lu
TheSilphRoad,removed,all of this being said i really wish they would have included some xy axis data on that chart that could easily have been a percent decrease or a percent decrease and the many cynics will surely point this out yup that is not a chart thats a red line over a white background a chart has labels and data to make the line mean something im not doubting their words tough im sure that what they say its true at least for the most part i just find it funny that they shared that image like it means something
TheSilphRoad,removed,no the solution is to reverse engineer unknown
TheSilphRoad,removed,update weve found the issue thanks to community development support now just need time to implement a fix
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was just correcting you based on what you defined
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a completely moronic way of thinking we dont know if that was a decrease or decrease im not defending sites like pv im simply say that if niantic really wanted to show how much a negative impact those kinds were having some xy graph data would be ya know necessary
TheSilphRoad,removed,thanks fur signing your name at the end of your post wouldnt never known you wrote it
TheSilphRoad,removed,have you ever even used a graph
TheSilphRoad,removed,you have zero clue my friend
TheSilphRoad,removed,i made a spreadsheet and ran the math it seems if you were hardcore you could reach lvl today by playing hours at efficiency and spend
TheSilphRoad,removed,they always get cooler things than the us why havent they spoken up about their beta ours didnt have anything like trading but we just kinda assumed it would be implemented upon wide release yet here we are also go kill yourself silphroad bot
TheSilphRoad,removed,stop trying to defend your botting
TheSilphRoad,removed,this assumes all x lures spawn pidgy and nothing else constantly and the guy just sits there and catches pidgies for hours a day at a rate of seconds per catch are you retarded if you start with such idiotic assumptions you can get anything
TheSilphRoad,removed,hi there checking in i have grinded over for three days straight and i dont think i had even candies saved up i also didnt play that weekend more than hours total i think there are some assumptions you are missing which i need to elaborate my average per day is roughly hours let it be known i have a full time job quick throw was only recently removed i was getting greats somewhere near of the time i used quickthrow nice excellent and misses or so i can do exphr without doing a single evolution with the recent update it was closer to before the update my left foot is blistered and i wear nikes every day i used to run maybe miles a week in the two months leading up to pogo i used to do like in college but ive been slacking and luckily just started getting in shape recently i live in austintx and the heat is miserable when i get off work at i usually head to our capitol building where i founded jimmys loop a stop loop which provides glorious benefits given youre willing to walk in the degree heat weve had recently source i just hatched my pokémon tonight a porygon it took me something like eggs i now sit at hatched it happened towards the end of the night so i do get that bonus i run through a lot of lucky eggs i told the community about my exphr spot because i needed help to subsidize the cost ive spent over on lureseggs yep i have ive caught over pokémon im very efficient and have a hardcore gaming background pvp focus gm experience etc pokéstops grabbed dont forget that stop exp bonus currently at evolutions so roughly a mil of my exp is from those alone using the restart method did you know you can run evolutions in minutes downtime has seriously screwed me on multiple occasions i use a rideshare to get to my destination and have spent over hours sitting in degree heat waiting for the map or entire server to come back i played with some semicasuals tonight and grinded about in just hours i could easily push expday if i had some friends helping me that facebook group has my entire journey documented on the first saturday of the game day i grinded in one day farming at atxs auditorium shores and got a charizard and something like more charmander candy another note if atx wasnt bugged for the first days of release i couldve been or by now no joke ask me any questions youd like i get a lot of hate for not cheating also ive never used a tracker to get a pokémon but i definitely talk with the community ps my username is derocher teammystic seeyououtthere
TheSilphRoad,removed,this reads like blatant fanboyism hanke sounds tired using words like we get up every day i get up every day dont you likely for less money than he does i might add and talking about what motives us to keep working saying gotta keep this ball rolling isnt good for pr you can feel the exhaustion in his tone its now been days since pokemon go exploded not saying im an expert but im pretty sure his job since nabbing the pokemon license is now guys did you fix the bug yet were losing money and my twitter got hacked
TheSilphRoad,removed,someone by the name of gageyg level has been taking gyms around my area when no one is even around that means they are gps spoofing and botting i reported himher just now hopefully this idiot gets banned
TheSilphRoad,removed,maybe instead of releasing a broken game to every country you could just make it work then increase your capacity and expand this isnt a valid excuse for removing tracking and i dont buy one bit that them shutting down pokevision and similar sites is what lowered the load
TheSilphRoad,removed,psa psa stands for pokedex sucks all
TheSilphRoad,removed,dont care
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel like even with what you said its possible considering if someone is stationed at pokestops or more at all times theyll be doing a combination of catching hatching evolving and claiming pokestop rewardsexp money and time really isnt a factor for those who are hardcore theyll gladly and easily spend thousands and just as easily spend hours a day playing the game ive met too many hardcore gamers to think someone hasnt reached legitimately im not the smartest person ill admit but i didnt think your post is saying its literally impossible due to time alone to reach no matter what so i believe that if its possible someway somehow legitimately then it has been done so people are crazy man ive learned to never underestimate the lengths at which we would go to for something or someone were deeply into to address a couple things imo there was a beta for the game so im sure that got people familiar with the items beforehand which means i doubt it took days for those hardcore players because surely they mustve gotten into the beta somehow to know how to use things correctly can hatch region exclusive pokemon from eggs if im not terribly mistaken i believe its impossible to throw excellent everytime so to make up for the exp defeceit they caught more or hatched more pokemon walking in a semilarge circle right by their pokestop lure spot my whole comment is probably stupid or invalid but hey fk it
TheSilphRoad,removed,useless
TheSilphRoad,removed,keeps saying code invalid are they all out
TheSilphRoad,removed,by reading the damn stickys
TheSilphRoad,removed,no just fucking no what is wrong with you people ninanitic is doing this to prevent any outside tracking for one reason only money people will progress in the game faster with these tools and they will sell less in game items that is it period now this is well within their right to do so and i cannot fault them for it however what they are doing is forcing people to create underground hacks to get the tracking that makes the game fun not a useless grind that constantly asks for more money as you get higher in level the game gets harder your goals are different it isnt as exicting because you are constantly catching the same pokemon over and over it is end game before the actual game end i think that with every level you should be able to see a larger and more accurate map of pokemon kind of like the circle compass pic that is around as you progress you can see more stuff what ninantic did is like prohibition by making trackers unavailable they are going underground they will not go away ninantic should be focusing on the core game issues of balance gym battles and making the game fun no matter where people live instead of waging war again something that is going to happen anyway so yeah screw the communcation it is just noise ninantic is going to be the next ubisoft or ea and become the most hated company in the world why because they took a great concept and made it all about protecting their bottom line instead of letting the game be great and the bottom line growing holistically they are like monsanto
TheSilphRoad,removed,who cares if they want to buy it let them buy it youll know he is a faggot
TheSilphRoad,removed,scyther is absolute shit when it comes to fighting right now eevolutions though
TheSilphRoad,removed,the current highest level legit player that can actually be confirmed to be legit is jandeezy from new zealand last i checked he is level the reason he is regarded as the highest level legit player is because he is a streameryoutuber who has broadcasted his progress which means its possible to track his leveling process from start to his current level he is proof that legit level is definitely possible
TheSilphRoad,removed,ok ill tell you why you are bad for spoofing lets say you go ahead and spoof but only to collect pokemon you now have the best collection of pokemon in your village far beyond anyone else in your village unless they are all spoofing too so you now have the capability to take over the gym in your village and never have anyone else beat it when trading starts you can crush everyone else when starts you again can crush everyone else will that make you feel good now if you are the only person playing in your town or you never use those pokemon you collect spoofing to battle in your town or to have an advantage in evolving then sure go ahead and spoof to collect them all remember that the spawning is generated from the processes that were shown in ingress where cell traffic influenced the density of spawns theres also the other side to spoofing the assholes that live in the big cities and spoof to take over gyms in small towns that have no chance of competing against if they allow your spoofing they allow the others as well

TheSilphRoad,removed,literally posts below yours
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah except when fighting gyms you dont always fight them in order and you get royally fucked
TheSilphRoad,removed,spoof over there and take the gyms with botted accounts and watch them rage sounds like a good wednesday to me
TheSilphRoad,removed,re greed im working on a business strategy and marketing course about greed the number of examples regarding the way people will buyuse stuff out of artificial greed is phenomenal and pokemon is a prime example of this
TheSilphRoad,removed,we see many legitimate lvl players not that it really matters since its just a game but when op posted this almost a full day ago how many of the tens of millions of players were legitimately level
TheSilphRoad,removed,get on your fakegps and they wont know wtf is happening give me the coords ill put a magmar xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,well there is a couple of measures they took you dont only need to tie the number to the account but you also have to verify it with the steam mobile app authenticator also to be eligable for prime you need to be at a certain level in the game which really takes a while to reach which for moat cheaters this just isnt worth the effort also all accounts tied to this phone number for the steam authenticator app so your alt accounts get perma banned if only one of the accounts gets convicted so all in all this is not a water proof system but is alot of effort to gain prime matchmaking status and the consequences are strict
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is an instance where someone whos spoofing their location might be warranted get someone to come in and just beat the gym down constantly from those guys dont have to put anything in just take them out repeatedly and they have no idea whats going on i think that would be hilarious
TheSilphRoad,removed,id make spoof accs with cp dragonites and would cement these gyms if i knew how d
TheSilphRoad,removed,iv internal values stab same type attack bonus
TheSilphRoad,removed,i used the tracker for all of the few days since it was phased out ever since then ive been using trackers at this point why would i ever stop whether there is in game tracking or not literally makes zero difference
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah the more time i spend out with other people playing the game in groups the more my opinion about trackers shifts from theyre cheating to they make the game better
TheSilphRoad,removed,more people get to catch the same pokemon from literally day but seriously they need to fix the game i have been at different sightings since like the week i havent seen a single new pokemon
TheSilphRoad,removed,until they up the spawn rates in my area you better believe im gonng use a tracker the game is a waste of time without one
TheSilphRoad,removed,yup all the scanner people ruining the game for themselves its not a sprint people
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dislike being rude but i genuinely loled at the idea of cheating at pokemon go a mobile phone app being illegal
TheSilphRoad,removed,glad they are releasing to even more people when they still cant fix the gym memory leak
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah the downside to having all these radarsmaps is the strain it puts on the servers we play on that being said for the many of us who dont live smack dab in the middle of nests and spawns maps is the only effective way to trackcatch pokemon and we only use those maps because for me anyways we feel like a way to track pokemon was promised to us from the get go im sure niantic will fix there tracker which will kill like of the traffic on tracking sites
TheSilphRoad,removed,great now all those countries get to experience all the blandness and bugs maybe they should focus on improving the game before getting it out to every country
TheSilphRoad,removed,knowing how oblivious niantic is id be surprised if they even knew about the law suit
TheSilphRoad,removed,yay found pidgeys and some worms
TheSilphRoad,removed,people wont mind tracking apps ftw
TheSilphRoad,removed,also patch note content is empty they only share half the content like what the fudge but their tweets are gold s
TheSilphRoad,removed,listen to you pious plebs until they add some kind of useful tracking system to the game using trackers is just fine you want to stumble around int he dark then knock yourself out dont you dare think youre better than those of us that arent that slow
TheSilphRoad,removed,sexual chocolate
TheSilphRoad,removed,nigga you talk too much
TheSilphRoad,removed,so is india this is bullshit
TheSilphRoad,removed,isnt half the fun hunting for it yes it sucks if you cant find it speak for yourself theres no fun whatsoever in it for me running around blindly in a wild goose chase hoping it would appear some time when most of the time it just disappears especially annoying if it was a very rare pokemon thats no fun whatoever its just incredibly annoying and the longer i play the game the more it annoys me im glad for radar sites which just provide functionality that should be there in the first place and which is already available in the holy land of sf but kept from others no cheating there i doubt i would still be playing this game without radar sites and a lot of others wouldnt either or those radar sites wouldnt be that popular and niantics already massive player loss would be far more severe still the sf tracker is the very least niantic should do even better would be if they showed you all the pokemon that are around you within a radius right on the map however if you tap on a pokemon you dont simply throw pokeballs to catch it instead you have to pick one of your pokemon to fight it until it is weak enough to try to catch it perhaps of its original hp with a pokeball that would be a great deal more fun than running around blindly and if you then stumble upon one just throwing pokeballs to catch it but perhaps they could provide that as an option for those who like running around blindly
TheSilphRoad,removed,i hate seeing posts like this stop trying to handicap those of us who are good at the game and just go level up so you can take us on this isnt the special olympics
TheSilphRoad,removed,the only one butt hurt here is op especially after what my dragonite just did to his back side
TheSilphRoad,removed,i put a tracker around my house and if i hear a ping on something i need i run out and grab it
TheSilphRoad,removed,people still play this game how are you still playing a mobile app that has literally no end game or pvp 😂
TheSilphRoad,removed,what about wadiya aladdin or aladdin
TheSilphRoad,removed,actually niantic responded to them its just that the dutch dont know what r means
TheSilphRoad,removed,great now if they could fix all the new bugs introduced before they push out their unfinished game to the rest of the world
TheSilphRoad,removed,no
TheSilphRoad,removed,by going out and searching for some
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol are you serious
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know what that means
TheSilphRoad,removed,what a waste of time the nests change every few weeks or so
TheSilphRoad,removed,are you going to do this every weeks when the nests change and make all that data useless
TheSilphRoad,removed,amazing and yet they still cant switch my trainer name back to the one i had after some fucktard stole my phone and changed itoff to email request
TheSilphRoad,removed,i think weve just been worn down by how long it has been since they released it and we still dont have a working system and a lot of people have simply left the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,that fuvking community manager only comments on individual players catches its ridiculous
TheSilphRoad,removed,i feel like by the time the real game is out im gonna be done with it
TheSilphRoad,removed,israel is still missing
TheSilphRoad,removed,none of those countries are going to have anywhere near the spawns that san francisco has i guarantee it
TheSilphRoad,removed,til helen kellar plays ingress ingress doesnt have anywhere near the resolution of pokemon go when it comes to building footprints landmark data or similar
TheSilphRoad,removed,they trying for any money at this point
TheSilphRoad,removed,hate to break it to you but you are falling behind the people who are cheating quick quickly
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is exactly it i got pissed at level because the best pokemon i had were all either egg hatch or vaporeons and found a scanner that works for me and now i have a bunch of dragonite snorlax lapras etc if i had been using the scanner at level i would have found tons at that level people that say you havent been exposed enough to the game are oblivious
TheSilphRoad,removed,its because people feel the need to be a special snowflake and add a new pin rather than just confirming or refuting on the already reported pin
TheSilphRoad,removed,how surprising cheating gone mad in a town full of chinese players
TheSilphRoad,removed,you could still get it it sounds like another one spawned right after the first one lucky
TheSilphRoad,removed,contradicting reports hooray
TheSilphRoad,removed,gym system revamp legendary events breeding shinies
TheSilphRoad,removed,imagine if this guys a niantic employee and this was their flawed reason for taking it out then realize its probably true
TheSilphRoad,removed,coming soon clean water food and democracy meanwhile enjoy the pokémon go
TheSilphRoad,removed,until they fix the tracker im numb to minor stuff like this
TheSilphRoad,removed,can confirm my desktop scanner stopped working roughly hours ago and down goes my interest for this game as well as the celsius around here see you at gen release
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah i mean before talking about level cap increase i would like to get at least one legendary bird and mewmew two geez niantic when are you releasing those
TheSilphRoad,removed,level each they were back to back and i was completely flabbergasted
TheSilphRoad,removed,i noticed this problem this morning my radar still works my accounts that were tracking all got flagged apparently so when i tried to log into them they were prompted with capcha verification after passing the verification they worked fine although its up to the individual if they want to risk logging into their dummy accounts to do this
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont know if i speak for everyone else but thank god my local map was destroying the game imo i hope this means they are releasing the new tracker even though im not the biggest fan of it and would rather just have the foot prints back
TheSilphRoad,removed,just caught my last snorlax i guess with fastmap was awesome while it lasted and saved me a great deal of time
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont even want to play anymore honestly knowing where to go to get what i needed was of the fun
TheSilphRoad,removed,i wish they would put some energy into making the game better rather than worse
TheSilphRoad,removed,this kills the game for me not practical for semi rural players to aimlessly wonder around hoping to catch the one rare spawn a month shame i loved the game
TheSilphRoad,removed,in an effort to reduce the playerbase even more niantic have removed another third party program that actually makes the game fun great work niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,now if only they could fix gym sniping or any of the real issues out there
TheSilphRoad,removed,pogo isnt an augmented reality anything letting you use your camera to see the real world is not enough to call yourself an arg its basically a gpsenabled mmo with no dungeons and really shitty pvp
TheSilphRoad,removed,im confused how this is offtopic andor venting
TheSilphRoad,removed,the default attacking pokemon algorithm is seriously stupid for the past few gyms ive had my recently evolved venosaur as my go to attacker even when it was matched up against first pokemon arcanine it sucks having to load up a high level gym worrying about it crashing while at the same time remembering to always scrolling down to switch to a pokemon with a good matchup that you had just used every single time even with all the bugs and the imbalances outside from the constant crashing this is probably the thing i hate most about gyms
TheSilphRoad,removed,yes new spawn points finally starting to see kabutos in my city
TheSilphRoad,removed,nah no worries they banned rooted phones so cheating isnt possible anymore s
TheSilphRoad,removed,waiting for niantic to implement captchas on every catches to solve botting without any inconvenience to legit players
TheSilphRoad,removed,so the translation of this message is basically we know that you botted your account to lvl or whatever but please stop botting now otherwise we will ban you seriously
TheSilphRoad,removed,true but the older photos also didnt make it into the daily streams of those additional hundreds of people its definitely true that late contestants dont have as long to rummage up friends to vote though
TheSilphRoad,removed,this isnt important to pokemon go go post it somewhere else
TheSilphRoad,removed,awesome job i had a lickitung i hatched a while ago lying around i leveled it up a few times and recorded all the stats as they went up in your sheet i cross checked it with urichiepantsbegones sheet and it seems to work out except that half levels have me quite confused as seems to correlate with level i upgraded it until i had not enough candy left and im pretty sure i maxed it out as you can see on the screenshot its still on dust cost but the pop up says trainer level is too low to power up im level so max level should be which if it is right now it should mean it has some pretty sweet stats yes in the screenshot i was cross checking it with level which to me seems like lvl in urichiepantsbegones sheet i used integers for the def and att value though so they might very well be switched but that doesnt really matter d its just the half level and level correlation that made me think i fucked up and maybe remembered or filled in the dust cost wrong in your sheet anyone wanting to weigh in on this do i have a nice and strong lickitung or just a onelevellowerweakling
TheSilphRoad,removed,were all playing weve all seen it ouch that hit right in the feels sincerely from japan
TheSilphRoad,removed,me very sad apparently increased spawns are not here to stay
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol yeah somebody at niantic screwed up and increased spawns and now they spin it as intended feature
TheSilphRoad,removed,as a sururban player with very few pokestops nearby and winter fast approaching and no longer any ability to spin stops as a passenger im very disappointed to hear that the item drops are temporary
TheSilphRoad,removed,ah its temporary a surprising disappointment im just shocked
TheSilphRoad,removed,aww temporary thought theyd done something right
TheSilphRoad,removed,the sad part is it wont last niantic has officially said so themselves
TheSilphRoad,removed,show us how good the game can actually be and then take it away thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,damnit finally having a reasonable number of pokemon isnt permanent is super lame people here posting pictures of spawns at once i was excited af to see three in one place for the first time
TheSilphRoad,removed,thats so freaking dissapointing this is so sad
TheSilphRoad,removed,its sad that the increased items are only temporary and not a sign they can see how they just hurt their passenger player base
TheSilphRoad,removed,honestly really disappointing for the long run knowing these are temporary especially losing all my spawn points near my house and suddenly having them return this morning now i know theyll disappear in a few days pretty lame
TheSilphRoad,removed,temporary and it doesnt even go to the weekend
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is just awful genuinely awful they showcase they can fix some of the issues of the game but act like its a treat for us to be taken just disgusting
TheSilphRoad,removed,im botting right now all i need was adjust my walk speed to lower than
TheSilphRoad,removed,and they do it again for hours people were excited again they thought it would get better from here on and then they just take it away again they could have announced that earlier now the community feels like losersagain
TheSilphRoad,removed,i thought it was a way to fix the removal spinning pokestops as a passenger sad to hear its temporary
TheSilphRoad,removed,i really thought they finally understood the right balance of the game but it really seems they just accidentally found that balance and will ruin it again by november if it wasnt so sad i shouldnt stop laughing at those neverending failures produced by niantic
TheSilphRoad,removed,yea this is definitely an announcement they should have made before implementing serverside now its just disappointing
TheSilphRoad,removed,the stops i hit are at red lights dip shit dont act like you know shit
TheSilphRoad,removed,everything good that they do is always temporary i could care less about the spawns going back to normal but for the love of neptune please keep the item drop rate
TheSilphRoad,removed,trying to placate the masses levying valid concerns and criticisms with a temporary boost to output that will ultimately do nothing to stop the bleeding
TheSilphRoad,removed,well my dreams are crushed again being a small towner spawns have always been sub par at best here i make a loop between the four closest pokestops when i go out and on average i catch maybe or pokemon during that entire minute loop for the first time ever tonight i felt like niantic actually cared about players outside of sanfran i got a taste of how it feels to play in a big city right here in my own town every pokestop here actually has pokemon spawning at it before i had like pokestops in town that spawned pokemon and niantic took the spawns at one of them away i just spent almost two hours walking around catching all kinds of pokemon i bought another pokemon storage upgrade the increased item drops at the pokestops helped make up for the speed cap which now limits me from collecting items from half the stops in my town ive been having so much fun all day its apparently so easy for niantic to fix the horrible spawn rates in towns like mine i just dont understand why they wont permanently fix them what do they gain by making the game miserable to play for players like me this event is exactly what ive been begging for since july when i started playing i dont want it to be raining dratini i dont want to be given free lapras all i wanted was to actually be able to find and catch a nice variety of pokemon while im out walking today after four long months of sticking with the game hoping it would get better here that finally happened then i come home for a quick rest hop on reddit to see how much everyone else is enjoying the change and get my soul crushed by the news that this event only lasts a few days then its back to my town being a relative pokemon ghost town and limited items thanks to the new speedcap
TheSilphRoad,removed,a pathetic attempt to placate the masses levying legitimate criticism with a temporary fix that will ultimately do nothing to stop the bleeding long term
TheSilphRoad,removed,funny how many people seemed to skip right over this comment before leaving their own
TheSilphRoad,removed,im trying not to be skeptical but with the tracking not working it still feels like heres what everyone is catching heres a pidgy for you
TheSilphRoad,removed,i had hoped this would be permanent im not happy about the super restrictions on vehicles but a super rich pokemon environment and extra stuff from stops would make this into a playable walking game
TheSilphRoad,removed,yep super annoying and unnecessary so basically par for the course
TheSilphRoad,removed,a temporary distraction to the permanent change of he pokestop speed limit this would be equal to someone beating you up then gives you candy and then eats it all themselves i like the candy phases though
TheSilphRoad,removed,i was so happy last night thinking increased item drop was a permanent thing to make up for the increased item drain from prestiging friendly gyms now i find out its only temporary this is seriously testing my faith
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is a con for keeping us entertained before they roll it back to normal values sigh
TheSilphRoad,removed,im slightly angry at the same time as being happy im actually catching pokemon in my somewhat rural area i dont want it to stop if most of the pokemon disappear i swear im quitting this game
TheSilphRoad,removed,lol then the update was pointless
TheSilphRoad,removed,reminder buffing pokestop last until november no seriously maybe niantic think they can buy me with limited time stuff it can go well the first time halloween now its a bit annoying every time they rollout an update that receive a lot of complaint from the community immediately after there is another update with good things smiles and rainbows everywhere limited time obviously this strategy is actually okay with kids from primary school
TheSilphRoad,removed,its a shame that this isnt permanent i was very excited because i thought there was finally a spawnpoint near where i live small town america i saw more pokemon on my sightings list than ever before and couldnt wait to get outside im sorry but when you go a mile and see one pidgey there is no point imagine walking in the grass in the gameboy game for mins without an encounter youd think is something wrong is this how the game is supposed to be eff this and go do something else then i see the pokexplosions going on in cities and it makes the venonats and a rattata i was stoked about seem stupid its a shame niantic seems intent on making the game harder and harder on people who dont live in cities the no driving kills it for many and the increased diversity means i get about as much xp now tiny grassroots communities are where the gym ownership is personal you can have an actual rival like in the games and you have a good chance of making real relationships with trainers because you will see the same people again these bonuses that help alleviate the pain for rural players and disabled players shouldnt be bonuses at all they should be permanent and if increasing spawns in rural areas is this easy make that permanent too you made me so happy you finally gave me something to go catch please keep it this way at least in smaller towns as the above explosions are crazy and im not seeing anything remotely close to that occurring here
TheSilphRoad,removed,and that is fair as in a way that could be called cheating
TheSilphRoad,removed,it doesnt need to be addressed as people will no longer be prestiging
TheSilphRoad,removed,so unfair to us rural players i have no poke stops within walking distance and the nearest poke stop to drive to do not like you using their carp ark to stop so they put comes out to block it off
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant understand how niantic doesnt see this
TheSilphRoad,removed,just make an alt account to knock out the lowest defender s
TheSilphRoad,removed,niantics incompetence knows no bounds
TheSilphRoad,removed,your pokemon how about your bank or anything else connected to your email stop checking reddit and get your email back already anyone who doesnt have twofactor authentication and a weak password will inevitably lose their account and everything connected to it
TheSilphRoad,removed,totally agree i spent minutes leveling up a gym by levels two to four and some assturd shows up and takes it down in less than two minutes thats a to ratio really balanced in other words you can spend minutes leveling a gym and a rival team can knock it down in minutes niantic really screwed up big time they should have just raised the prestige gain from attacking and leave defending prestige alone
TheSilphRoad,removed,good job posting stuff thats been posted constantly and is even on the hot page
TheSilphRoad,removed,gym sniping against enemy teams always seemed so pointless to me if you snipe a gym from an enemy gym theyre just going to take down your pokemon immediately after i have been sniped numerous times by an enemy team and it didnt even bother me in fact i quite enjoyed it cause it means i could battle more pokemon and gain a little more xp the way the game is made its stupidly easy to attack gyms and you have all the advantages dodging stupid cpu type advantage etc so its really not hard to attack the real problem lies in same team sniping which you can do nothing about
TheSilphRoad,removed,the real gym sniping issue wasnt fixed training a gym to to have your spot sniped by the same team is the real problem
TheSilphRoad,removed,this seems more like a rpokemongo thread
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah they took their evil arch enemy on the of november remember remember and now theres no one to pick a fight with so their target must be the nest atlas s d
TheSilphRoad,removed,omg where are all these video pluggers spawnig from
TheSilphRoad,removed,so its still behind all the good maps nice
TheSilphRoad,removed,last i checked is less than
TheSilphRoad,removed,
TheSilphRoad,removed,its only showing within about a mile of me and im in a somewhat residential area anyone know what gives
TheSilphRoad,removed,yeah seriously how do you not have this down
TheSilphRoad,removed,thesilphroadcomresearch of course
TheSilphRoad,removed,silphroad one is by far the least accurate of the
TheSilphRoad,removed,oops im at the airport so i didnt watch the video the description sounded like a one of a kind thing not multiple eeveelutions
TheSilphRoad,removed,sorry but i already got a snorlax
TheSilphRoad,removed,silph road is about to launch a global nest atlas just for this purpose stay tuned lolawesome
TheSilphRoad,removed,gamedata is cheating btw
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh shit this just got real
TheSilphRoad,removed,its yeah i feel braindead too where do i go to access and enter the code
TheSilphRoad,removed,ahh okay i understand now so generally when i search a pokemon up the percentage should be around thanks a lot so my rhyhorn is pretty decent then
TheSilphRoad,removed,my lil bros girlfriend caught a magikarp with cp but its up to you either way
TheSilphRoad,removed,i cant even deal with this level of stupid right now
TheSilphRoad,removed,this is only a hypothesis every once in a while i evolve a pokemon and the cp more then doubles could it be possible that these specific pokemon evolve to a higher cp i will test and reply again later this week
TheSilphRoad,removed,it means he has been visited by the blue ghost of cerulean town you need to forward this screenshot to more trainers or soon your whole team will be covered in blue clouds
TheSilphRoad,removed,i know the seal and dratini nests but what did you get for voltorb
TheSilphRoad,removed,hell yeah this is what i come to this sub for hard hitting facts and analysis ftw xd
TheSilphRoad,removed,i didnt find out about ivs til a few days ago wasnt aware of better stats on hatched ive got an army of shitty vaporeons i can only imagine what i threw away
TheSilphRoad,removed,seriously and you guys also block swearing fuk this
TheSilphRoad,removed,no need to be an arse
TheSilphRoad,removed,still only see pidgy and rattata
TheSilphRoad,removed,this my only disappointment with this event is having to read all the ftp kids complaining about not getting more for free enough already shut up and say thank you for the free incubators the rest of us have always paid for so you can keep not spending money ffs people complain niantics not wiping their rear well enough but dont wanna buy the two play paper
TheSilphRoad,removed,that subreddit its basically a bunch of nabs boasting themselves with perfect ivs rattatas
TheSilphRoad,removed,sighthis is the silph road now
TheSilphRoad,removed,because you know that i didnt try searching okay glad you know everything making assumptions about people you never met i bet your great at socializing too
TheSilphRoad,removed,what no mewtwo the pogo trailer clearly showed mewtwo on nye wahnianticripoffim scarred for lifeterrible american companyi spent real money on this gameim entitled to mewtwoendless complaint threads with one word different in the titlelmao
TheSilphRoad,removed,i started wasting money at please dont you will regret it keep it up
TheSilphRoad,removed,for the typical idiot it is
TheSilphRoad,removed,bug has been a thing for quite some time now no one quite understands how niantic can be quite so incompetent as to have the game running smoothly be a bug
TheSilphRoad,removed,u r smrt
TheSilphRoad,removed,idgi
TheSilphRoad,removed,i dont give a ish whether people believe me im saying i wont believe ops claim without video because in my lvl experience it isnt true eff yaself
TheSilphRoad,removed,oh my god its just like a reskin of ingress and theres no pvp its like nothing like pokemon purple my panties are wet bring it on
TheSilphRoad,removed,dude on the right is probably the ugliest person ive seen in a while
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyre back caught yesterday as it should be during the event i only got in one week the spawn rates were terribly low
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i only caught one the last day of the event but they were there even during the event not counting the first hours until niantic hot fixed dratini spawns i think they changed something in the general spornrate of different mons we saw some other people report diffrent rates of spawns than they are used to for example swinup
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught one this morning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep started as soon as the event finished here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught one last night around midnight gmt and it was at a stop near my house but at a stop right by my house which has never happened before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep back to normal here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they are back ive seen tons of them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw way more dratni djuring the event xd even a dragonair once
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in a week is impressive i saw one on the sightings and couldnt find it edit where are you hunting to grab a day btw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the beaches around charleston are slim barrier islands so one side counts as a river biome while the other is ocean ill catch sometimes in minutes if im on a bike
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,meguro river playing hours but you need to walk to increase your chance of encountering them staying in one spot will bring much less by the way no later than this morning i got dratini apart from each other nice to see the spawn rates fixed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh yea i remember reading in your post you were around there a bit wow that is good im sweet with walking i do along a less populated river most days any specific part of the river or just where ever yea saw the same thing around yokohama dratini all bunched up round yamashita park awhile back real good to see these little guys again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its your second strongest pokemon so stick it in a gym who cares about the moves if youre not fighting with it yourself all that matters is cp for gym positioning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to make you feel better i have a with bulldoze
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ahh sorry 😞 anyway arcanine still has good stats so it still might be one of your best attackers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you power it up it will have a high cp so it will be higher up in gyms thats about it really it used to be an amazing bottom of gym entry because it was extremely easy to take down with a halfcp vaporeon but that is less important now with the sixperson team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should hold onto it and use him because hes your favoritehowever i wouldnt power him up i was in a similar situation where i evolved a growlithe into a bitebulldoze arcanine growlithe are exceptionally rare around me so i decided to just use my leftover candy to power him up since i figured id never have another shot about a month later after some miracle hatches backtoback i landed a arcanine with fire fangflamethrower the candy and stardust i wasted poweringup the first arcanine could have gone a long way towards maxing out my superior arcanine if i had patience i could have saved myself a ton of buddy km i had a similar situation with blastoise i landed a biteflash cannon through evolution and decided to max him because i really like blastoise and have a million watertype attackers not two weeks later a blastoise spawned at my friends house which i managed to catch water gunhydro level i dont feel as bad about this since blastoise is a redundancy in a vaporeondefined meta but the point standsenjoy your catch even if not ideal but dont convince yourself you wont get what you truly want further down the line
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bad moves are only really that bad on lower cp pokemon who cannot go in gyms itll be fine for defending of the time people will use a water type to fight it and if that water type happens to be a slowbro or starmie for example its gonna get super effective damage on the fast move anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also to make you feel better i accidentally evolved my arcanine which did get fire fang but also got bulldoze i meant to evolve my growlithe are rare where i live
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also make you feel better all my iv arcanine have bulldoze
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,beating exeggcutors and surprising the one or two rock type attackers you may have in your lifetime
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i too evolved a iv growlithe recently into an arcanine guess what bite and bulldoze the only difference to your case is that it was from an egg ie it has level and ill probably leave it there so its my strongest pokemon just experiment with it against enemies that are weak against dark bite or ground bull doze
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulldoze is awful on offense long animation and low damage so i wouldnt attack with it but bulldoze is actually good on defense as it may catch some attackers off guard arcanine is high cp too so as a defender he has some good staying power stick him in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have the same and i never use it for anything i guess i could use bite vs exeggutor but i dont i pretty much use the same when attacking and he doesnt make the cut
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,idk about bulldoze but spammig bite vs exegutor seems to work i have a twister gyarados i exclusively use vs exegutor idk what it is but i find it somewhat enjoyable spamming very fast moves like bitefury cutter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,growlithe dont spawn here so i was elated to catch a arcanine on a rare trip to the city fire fangbulldoze i just spam fire fang it mows down exeggcutor just fine you could do the same since bite is se against exeggcutor and with arcanines super high attack stat exeggcutor goes down pretty fast use what you got is my pogo motto
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,defending bulldoze is really annoying to fight against and bite is pretty decent quick move anyway you say its your second strongest pokemon you are going to use it alot i live where growlithe are kind of common their evolution gets soo much cp compared to the other pokemon i end up fighting vaporeons with my cp arcanine i have arcanines around to cp while my normal pokemon are around cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have an arcanine that i love and perfect moveset hatched from an egg but i never get to use it because like you its my second strongest pokemon which means it is always in a gym just below dragonites but above the laprasvaporeonsnorlax wall any time i get it back i stick it right back into a gym after powering it up once id be silly not to because it easily buys me a few days of extra coins and the only thing that arcanine can do that some other pokemon cant is fight lapras but then thats what my snorlax are for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its good as a defender archanines seem to use the move constantly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive evolved arcanines now and all of them had bulldoze except which has biteflamethrower im using him to attack and wont power him up though i give up and our nest dried up months ago so theyre rare here now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive evolved arcanines and gotten bitebulldoze on both i feel your pain bro
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey if you ever need something to smash gengars smiling face that arcanine should do it better than pretty much anything else in the game thanks to the halloween event you might actually see a couple
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bite is se against exeggutor while fire resists his grass type charge move if any just spam bite and dodge dont use bulldoze though its horrible
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had pretty much the same thing i maxed it look at it this way if you put an arcanine in a level ten gym is the difference between bulldoze and fire blast in your arcanine going to be what keeps that gym from coming down no way power it up hide it behind a few snorlaxes and watch your pretty arcanine collect coins every day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also have a iv arcanine with bulldoze sadly i couldnt find any use for it if its cp is very high you can place it in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey me too i powered that sucker up to cp its not terrible if the ivs are good you can just power it up and stick it in a gym at cp realistically speaking people arent going to have much trouble mowing it over so the moveset doesnt matter as much also bite is super effective against starmie and slowbro so theres that bulldoze can also sort of work like water pulse in that theres a chance that itll use it multiple times in a row i think making it possible to catch people off guard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,slowbro laughed and used confusion arcanine fainted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,psychic types like slowbro exeggutor and hypno missing one are the most common psychic type pokemon in gyms golduck isnt psychic though he does have psychic moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought snorelax with lick did better also dark basic also great stats but its got workable stab charge moves to draw on too so long as you dont get earthquake i could be misremembering though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ahem i wish more people who stop powering up a monster because it has a bad move set could understand this principle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulldozing those battle won hmm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same 😥
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this if youre strapped for high cp options to get a top spot in gyms its probably worth the investment theres also the ghost of a chance niantic will someday allow moveset changes i wouldnt count on it but maybe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i too evolved a blastoise with biteflash cannon i ended up maxing him out as hes my favorite pokémon currently sitting pretty at love sticking him in gyms i just hatched a squirtle fingers crossed for biteice beam so blastoise actually had a purpose attack dragonites honestly water gun hydro pimp blastoise feels unnecessary with my vape army
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i went from florida to pennsylvania family vacation to get the egg that this one hatched from i feel you on the rare aspect i still havent found a nest near mereasonably close ofc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at least you still have a chance on a good move set for the when you finally do get to evolve it wouldnt you have felt worse if your got bulldoze gotta look for the silver lining
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ouch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how do you know its your strongest seems oddly specific
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this reminds me houndoom will be amazing against eggs when gen finally comes out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are no darktype pokemon in gen so it just comes down to base attack stat arcanine has a very good base attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lick is ghost type
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in terms of pure dps on dark moves arcanine is considered best that is that an arcanine spamming bite will do better than any other pokemon using any other dark moves including gengar which gets two dark type moves and has the highest dps dark moveset ie dark quick and dark charge in terms of usability snorlax will be better because as you noted its got stab on charge and will also take more damage and therefore last longer to deal more damage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup its actually perfect for gyms itll sit behind vapesexeggutors of same level and iv means itll sit behind most other arcs also you wont ever have gym stuck envy wishing he was out of the gym so you could use him since he has a horrible moveset i actually prefer my high ivs roll the bad moveset so i can leave em in gyms and never worry that im not having one of my better attackers eg doze arc pulse vape psychic exeggutor
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tended to use him a lot as well just to switch things upi really liked that he filled a different role on my team hes been stuck in a gym for over a month now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got a water gun flash cannon one i stick in gyms all the time at about cp not sure if it is good but blastoise is my favorite and hes my only one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,where in fl im in jax and growlithes are abundant at the beach ive evolved so far two with bulldoze and one with flamethrower have enough candy to evolve two more but just havent found one worth evolving yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same with my vapo havent had a vapo with hydro pump yet everyone either evolved into something else or just ended with up water pulse i already gave up on vapo and arcanine now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sort pokemons by cp then count
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not as good as scizor hell have double resistance to grass resistance to psychic and his bug moves get boosted twice against a psychicplant type
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah i forgot that dark wasnt in gen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,right which is also se against psychic my mistake for confusing the two
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a great way to think about it i tend to hold back my pokemon with the best move sets its a pain when my one zhsb exeggutor is unavailable for instance and i only have one good hydro pump vaporeon so she isnt going anywhere often i dont even power these up in favor of the defenders otoh when i get a lousy moveset i just want to stick it in a gym asap to earn its keep
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and actually if it gets stuck behind an exeggutor theres an excellent chance that future attackers will be using a fire pokemon to take out the exeggutor bulldoze comes very early so theres a good chance one of their fire pokemon will eat it take it from me the other day i had just polished off an exeggutor with an arcanine but still had a full bar charge move available so i thought what the heck and used it against the arcanine after dodging the first two strikes boom bulldoze to the face
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,south of tally near crawfordville
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont you hate that i think of my vapes have pulse id love to see some research on whether certain moves are more common than others ime some moves eg solar beam have been almost impossible to get while others are way more common than they should be water pulse edit i know anecdotal evidence is not all that useful and im definitely not saying my experience can prove otherwise per se but id just like to see some evidence that the move sets really are random and not weighted in any way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah good point and scizor should also be pretty solid against lapras if he gets decent steel moves metal clawiron head maybe speaking of which i hope we see some new moves added when gen comes out since there are no or bar charge moves for either steel or dark type
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and once the mews are around something strong with dark moves will be helpful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dark is strong against ghost types didnt realize it until i used arcanine against a gengar that i figured ill just go head on bite bulldoze are good against fire type pokemon if you dont have a better counter until last week when i used my lucky egg i had no vaporeon or a strong sandslash so i used to fight arcanines with arcanines had no bulldoze until the last lucky egg as well but now i dont need it lol think of it this way fire isnt effective against fire so you get lower damage from ember arcanines also bite doesnt lose damage while ember does ground is super effective against fire so you can put out a lot of damage using bulldoze
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still think its rng though i am pretty lucky with grass type except for venusaur and top but at the same time i dont have a blizzard dewgong fire blast charizard wing attackhurricane pidgeot or even a gunhp goldduck guess accepting that you cant have it all is part of the game just keep trying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ditto udronpes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ditto udronpes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poisontypes are weak against ground so thats another ding on gengar ghostpoison
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,be sure to double check that another traveler hasnt spotted it first friend youve submitted several a few minutes behind other travelers now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no mine is at km
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,must just be you ive got on my togepi buddy without any weird bugs like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine is at
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what then is wrong with mine i was so happy for having him and now i see its broken i cant get more than candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait a day and walk again youve likely hit the cap per day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thnx will try didnt know there is a cap for walking im walking lot on work so im using that for hatching and buddy candys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thnx once again it was cap now finaly i have my togetic 😉
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can confirm was playing with a friend i was he was and we both got the same cp pokemon hes now and still the same we have literally caught hundreds of the same pokemon since he hit level and this has never differed everyone who encounters a pokemon will get the same ivmoveset no matter what level the trainer is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its been determined that trainers with level encounter the same pokemon at the same rates
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a level player will catch the same as a level player
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at a bit over a week ago i was encountering the same cp mons as a level who was at the same farm spot as i was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on this note have you noticed lower levels such as getting better cp pokémon than you at the same time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe the only real advantage is getting slightly reducing the difficulty of capture when you exceed level by enough level wild pokemon should resist capture less ive no idea if thats true but it seems to be true for lower level mons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn thats disappointing i was really hoping the cp multiplier would at least be different thats exactly what i was looking for though thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,having been the same level as my daughter up through i can say that while the ivmoveset was the same we did not always see the same cp mons maybe of the time we did but far less than a majority of the time since we are no longer the same level the rate of seeing the same cp mon has dropped somewhat though we do still sometimes see the same cp what i will say is that at level for me and for her now i occasionally see rare mons that she doesnt see just yesterday i saw omanyte and dratini at two different places and in the same spots she saw rattatta and psyduck i have no idea if i were level and she were whether id still see more rarer mons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,once tonight already lvl got snorlax and i got snorlax edit twice actually tangela for his lvl and tangela for my level trainer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as nice that would be its probably just your imagination were fairly certain that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think its good news im close to and cant wait to relax a bit once hitting the grind is real enough as it is no need to chase the dragon all the way to the unreasonably high xp levels at i might change my mind after getting closer though haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how would that be possible doesnt every player have the same chance at that type of pokemon at the exact location for the spawn period except ofcourse for incense spawns it would kinda invaluate scanners if that was the case
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that is not possible i play with my so all the time and i have never had anything appear for me that she didnt see or vise versa
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well then i guess that explains why everyone used to think leveling up makes the game harder cuz it damn sure doesnt make anything easier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are two scenarios here occasionally just due to gps or signal or whatever a mon will appear on my phone and not hers or vice versa ive played with several different people and experienced it in different places with different people and its a logical thing to expect but the second scenario is less logical and only with higher in the pokedex pokemons these are cases where i will see something like dratini or omantye and she will see in the exact same spot at the same time a lower pokedex pokemon it doesnt happen that often but its happened enough that it clearly seems like a thing and niantic did say somewhere early on that the higher the level the better chance of seeing rare pokemons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would love for there to be a feature where you could bring your pokemon back out of their balls and into the real world so you could take pictures of them wherever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if not im asking a friend to take a pic of me with my first pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,selfie stick flip the phone the other way practice before the game comes out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am kind of shocked i havent hear more with interacting with your own pokemon for instance petting them with the touch screen or augmented reality like in xy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me and my buddy httpsimgurcomtxuvdgc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mean in the qa there was the dog in the pictures and it looked cool if you framed it right you could obviously take a selfie too but i doubt pogo can use the front facing camera so youd probably need a friend to help you frame it properly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,catch a mon in front of a mirror
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would be cool to have a pokemon amie type of thing where you could feed it and look at it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not possible for to take a selfie with a pokemon you cant change the cameras in taking picture feature
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a great idea hopefully niantic will eventually get this idea passed by them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just might need to go out and buy a selfie stick now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for sure getting the small attack bonuses or cp boosts from playing with them like in the last few generations of main games
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems like a good idea but having to interact with hundreds of pokemon daily seems to be just to much i played mobles for some time and having to interact with my pets constantly became a nuisance quite fast
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,omg even got growlithe on ur shoulder o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how do you think selfies were taken before front cameras were a thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,screenshot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont mean to be rude but couldnt a similar result be accomplished through developing your skill at quickly switching out pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes however after switching out your pokemon if your next one gets beat down and knocked out it automatically puts back in your low hp pokemon with my suggestion that wouldnt be possible also depending on the connection and the device if theres a small lag your pokemon might take some additional damage while youre trying to manually switch it with another pokemon if the hp on that pokemon is almost up that one extra hit from the defender could knock your pokemon out again this wouldnt be possible if you could set limits having this auto switch out method would be much more efficient and ensure that youre pokemon gets switched out once it reaches a certain set hp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can help yourself by using my excel file i explained a lot about it here you can input same pokemon many times and use different ivs movesets etc see how its strength changes and make your own conclusions generally cp is a bit misleading because it is just a value derived from the effective attack the effective defense and the effective hp ivs play an important role but not if the difference in two sets of ivs is small moveset plays a huge role knowing type advantages also plays a huge role its very difficult to come up with general formula that solves everything in this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,iv case by case its sure that def iv is more valuable for chansey than another pokemon cause base stat for def is cant answer in detail for yours others questions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this thread is exactly what i was looking for thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,height and weight have no confirmed purpose except for two medals dodgeability how fast the defenders charge move happens or how difficult it is to see is a factor but wont be captured in a spreadsheet cp includes a combination of level base stats and ivs so its generally the quickest indication of strength but as torpedorunner said its weighted towards attack and doesnt include moveset or type weaknesses
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel you except mines was a rapidash overall your rapidash may not be great in battle but i still like it at least shes blown away by the stats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught mine with the first ball curve great throw ultra ball level i feel you had some horrible rng luck big virtual hug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,least you dont have to spend on a charmanda only to have it turn out with terrible moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wasted more than ultras on two dragonites both successfully fled on me so unlike me you have the dex entry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess that balls come short for many this morning with lucky egg the first mon i did see was charmeleon catched it and got xp during the same lucky egg catched charmanders more charmeleon bulbasaurs and before the end of lucky did see ivysaur hit the run and catched as well this is way more charmander candy than in the last months i bet anyone can get enough candy for charizard before jan ah my hint for impossible catch if i do not catch with first balls i sometimes no longer try to be good i will resync my throw and throw at random times to the mon this may have better chances than trying hard to be good with all throws
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel niantic should make the pokemon easier to catch the lower its ivs are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well dont keep us hanging did you catch it i cant face a reality where it ran 😭😭😭
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly if ultra balls arent cutting it i always throw a few great balls its worked on a few dragonite in the past for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no subreddit can be free of shitposting i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charmander evolved into charizard with ember dragon claw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,caught caught is the word youre looking for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since op was able to appraise it then i assume they caught it first
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at about originally ultras left i gave up for a minute but after catching the pidgey and spearrow in my range he still was there looking at me laughing in my face so i got back to him and finally managed to catch him at left cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,edc here my only pokemon caught farmed a small nest for a whole rotation to get the candies severe case of foe developed after that holding onto a whole bunch of iv pokemon that i just cant find the courage to evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you got extemely unlucky if he popped out of that many did you miss a lot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank god faith in world restored
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i maybe hit out of this its so hard for me getting my ball fly that far it seems so random to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you spin curveballs the trick to do it right and get a great throw is track as many pixels as you can with decent speed on your fingers way to the top right corner you dont want to do a fast flick because the touch screen will only register a few touches on the way you want to do a confident quickish move after spinning the ball to get curve particles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if ops rate at hitting the pokemon is at then i dont think he is ready for curveballs yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,alternative way is to turn the phone upside down and just swipe straight down but yeah ub on pokémon yikes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only with mons that are really far away and yes i always use curveballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whats the point of your post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hello i dont know if it is new but i just realized that after powering up a pokemon if you swipe to another pokemon it will show some stars above their heads but just for some pokemon anyone know what it means is it any kind of suggestion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,most of the time when a game goes live beta testers have to start over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at the very least there will be a wipe before an open beta so there will be no advantage other than battle and catching experience how good they are at it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,will field testers have an advantage over non field testers sure a minor one because of knowledge of gameplay mechanics accounts will be wiped so actual gameplay progress wont be an issue but anyone browsing this subreddit and keeping up to date with info will basically have the same info field testers do so honestly you have nothing to worry about
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httppokemongonianticlabscom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cant remember exactly where i saw it but niantic did say progress would be reset at release ill drop you a link if i can find it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it will give them a small advantage because theyll know where the pokemon spawns gyms and pokestops are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think there will be a major advantage either way the game is easy enough to learn gyms dont appear to be that difficult to take also if someone speeds over to a gym at level or and drops one of hisher few pokemon on it chances are its going to be something very weak youll be able to get a strong enough pokemon pretty quickly and take the gym earning yourself some exp on the way there is a lot of info yet to be released on these mechanics but everything currently available points to this not being a big deal as far as locations it appears if you know where portals are located you will know how to find gyms and pokestops there is rumor that these are going to be switched up a bit some pokestops will change to gyms and vice versa regardless youre going to need pokemon to place at the gym and gear from pokestops to capture them so just going to your known portals will likely be good enough i think overall there will be a tiny advantage to field testers they will have experience in the game and be able to operate a little more efficiently as a result thats about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well what im saying is who ever gets the gym first will have an advantage as in they will speed to the gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we didnt in ingress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what im saying is who ever gets the gym first will have an advantage as in they will speed to the gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not mainly about the knowledge of mechanics its knowledge of poke stops and spawns but most important they will beat people to the pokemon gyms and as im sure we have all heard from beta testers its really really really really hard to take a gym from a enemy team and its really who ever gets to the gym first that gets it a beta tester hey if im wrong tell me i would love to be wrong or get an update they have changed something lets all hope they have a open beta test so we all start off with the same chance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think it was in the nda
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id say that if you were already playing ingress youve already got that advantage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,correct but that isnt what usually happens as an ingress founder i actually found that slightly annoying i have done beta for many games and have learned to enjoy the reset that happens
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyve said they will wipe pgo data though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for ingress prebeta was the actual beta think only googlers played it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes getting to gyms quickly will be important now that theyve added an exp bonus for holding a gym day will be booked off work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are already maps available that show locations for stops and gyms similar to the ingress intel map community made will be available well before release for people to plan out their routes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not exactly because not all portals are pokestopsgyms and you dont know where the pokemon spawns are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fair enough i havent done a lot of beta testing so im not particularly familiar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gotchya that makes sense to do honestly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly this is pretty much the only serious advantage i see us having well be more used to the ball throwing mechanics inventory management and pokemon tracking however these are all temporary advantages that well have that has no direct affect on other players with a few hours of play non beta testers will have gained these skills anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we dont even know if the pokemon spawns will be the same come full release
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well my comment was more centered around what ssid about portals not so much the spawn imo spawns arent all too area restrictive there is some patterns but nothing set in stone as compared to portals
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this would be best as a comment in your other thread friend we try not to have extremely similar toplevel posts on the main thread at the same time looks great though cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is snorlaxs minimum cp as far as im aware edit not sure why im being downvoted if im wrong correct me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,some random kid sat next to me at school one time and noticed i was playing pokémon so he started talking to me about it he told me he had caught two snorlax at and cp didnt believe him until he showed me terrible luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my mini but mighty in all his cp glory lol he was my buddy for km i dont have the heart to transfer him
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have an amazing cp one with attack defense and stamina only a range known at this low a level ive kept it for months in case some day i might want to power it up that is seeming less and less likely one thing it is useful for is buddy walking since its only on very rare occasions id want to use it in gyms i used it to prestige some cp garbage once i have over walked
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still dont have one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good attack combination
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and it was my very first one yesterday i caught one with in the
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax lowest cp is heres the maths attackiv powerbasedefense defenseiv powerbasestamina staminaiv powercpm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do people want these lets say i have one and ifwhen trading is implemented is this something id be able to trade for some other poke i would wantneed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here is a list of minimum cp for all pokemon according to this list is snorlaxs minimum
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are right buddyi have one with cp he has iv too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dang just cp off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,according to something posted on tsr a while back i believe its actually as the minimum if i wasnt on mobile i would link the post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,never mind i found the other post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and the worst moveset what a beauty
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the iv calculator on silph says and another iv calculator i checked says maybe was the minimum before the cp changes months ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when the trading comes ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh thats possible i forgot snorlax was part of the cp changes is probably correct then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokestops give you eggs to hatch berry potions and greatultra balls if youre just going to sit on your couch and pay for incense and lucky eggs then you can buy regular balls too i love you like a brother but stop worrying about what other players may or may not be doing and get out there and walk there are only item slots fill them up before you go home
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maye something like increase rare spawn rates and average cp for pokemon found very far away from pokestops eg if your nearest pokestop is miles away you may see more evolved forms than the lucky people living under a pokestop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know it sucks but some people will be lucky and some wont ill be one of the unlucky ones we can only hope they size down the ingress portals properly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a small town player im very much in favour of solution because i thought of it while reading your intro and then was pleasantly surprised when reading it right away solution is possible except one player per stop rule which is lets just say there arent enough stops for all of us what bugs me is the possibility that one would constantly have to buy poké balls for cash in order to not run out of them too quickly whereas others that are fortunate enough to just life at the right place will never have this problem if this wasnt a game id go so far as to call it discriminatory because one gets punished with a worse experience for not living in the right place a game shouldnt open up such categories
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well niantic have made it very clear pokemon go is not aimed to be competitive like the other pokemon games so i doubt you have much to worry about unless youre determined to single handedly take every gym in ur area taking on gyms seems to be intended as a fun group activity and u cant use items in battle anyways the only type of advantage people right on top of pokestops are going to really get is more poke balls they cant exactly spam recovery items in battle and from the look of it if ur careful u shouldnt use more revives then u would have by normally gathering oh and i believe limited bag space is a thing in pokemon go really limited from what ive seenheardread so in the end the only thing these people get is a bunch of extra items clogging up their bag space
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know enough about the gameplay in pogo to say whether it will definitely be an issue but i do know about what it was like in ingress and it was noticeable sure you could go for walks daily and fill up and i did but people with home portals can too so they still have a noticeable advantage with their chances for the better rarer items being much higher so why leave the game asis with a noticeable imbalance when you can add some functionality to mitigate that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,realistically i cant complain although i have no home portals i am within walking distance of a good number of them people living in more suburban areas or straight up rural areas have it much worse which is further reason why i feel like one of these suggestions or another entirely different solution should be considered
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that may be true with regards to not enough stops for everyone in ingress it seemed like there was more than enough portals though at least for the semiactive to active players so the solution was based on that the balance may be different in pogo so it may not be as viable and yeah i like even playing fields though of course completely even in all regards is never going to be possible with this type of game i wont stick around long though if i have to keep buying poke balls just to keep up or suffer noticeably compared to others who happen to live in more fortunate areas and can coast
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its true that this may be much less of an issue in pogo than it was in ingress and even in ingress it was hardly a gamebreaker supply chains of items were created among teams to distribute surplus items to those in less fortunatemore volatile areas and this plus your own inventory management due to a cap on items as well became a strategic part of the game the imbalance was still there though and made it frustrating for certain players to rely on the kindnessteamwork of others in order to be able to compete i suppose this may not be much of an issue and maybe its not worth worrying about just thought id get a discussion out there anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try logging out and in again or switch out buddy also there are a few other post about people complaining about not recieving candies i also had a issue with my lapras not showing my candy after switching buddy it corrected itself tho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you do it in one day and walk another pkm before theres a i think cap on buddys per day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this made me count the candies ive earned during this event and i have one too many not that im giving it back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only explanation is you did something and forgot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive noticed that i dont get my routine candies after every when my phone is in battery saver mode as i walk it needs verification but it would explain the discrepancy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks i just switched buddy but it shows the same oh well not much i can do about it i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no ive only done about a day filthy casual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i went straight to grimer when halloween was active and have had it buddied since then with the small km requirement even if i swapped out midcandy im still down way more candy than adds up id have to walk then swap buddy over times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would hardly call it the only explanation as someone else mentioned theres the km cap and this being a visual or even a normal glitch is definitely within the realm of possibility
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been using battery saver i hope this isnt a bug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well yeah seeing as he already restarted the app to reomove visual glitch and even with the cap do the math
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just did the math with my buddy and it adds up i walked a lot while being in battery saving mode
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn good news i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that is interesting its like its been changed to cluster spawn random things
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not random as it stays with one kind of pokemon per day in hours the sort doesnt change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been having this same thing happening to me in a nearby park
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all wallpapers and sticker templates can be found here zazzle store wwwzazzlecomyadesignxproducts zazzle seems to have the best quality and variety of cases they do take some time to perfect though if youd like a specific design just tell me the number colour youre all welcome to use a different service if you want i do this only for fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just realized that a battery case option is available for the iphone lucky bastards
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup happened to me on a egg hatch was charmander woohoo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wonder if its just then mine were both i got excited but no idea what it means
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like httpgoptimizfrendefenders and pokebattlercom both ignore the fact that cp is king for the gym meta in most regions though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blissey highest cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to use ivstats as that gave a clear description of best defense and best attacking with a b or c rating is there an up to date version of this style of image or document
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks ive seen this one before i like that it gives you a full breakdown of their attacks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont see more pikachu than before the event still every day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pikachus here yesterday i drove an hour to visit a nest somewhere else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im in coastal connecticut and party pikachu is appearing at the park a half a block from my house regularly ive caught four so far and theres been a few others on the radar i just didnt feel like going after at the time normally i may see a pikachu once every week or two update on a minute walk just now i got four more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive noticed beach towns are crazy about spawn rates the combination of big bodies of water rivers parks downtown areas and all of it make for a pokémon paradise its also very beautiful to hunt pokémon while there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in nice france most of the city is an electric biome magnemites and voltorbs spawn more frequently than pidgeys here so far ive caught party pikachus within of gameplay
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was at queenspark invercargill nz yesterday for hours nothing went to a lighthouse today with stops near and caught in minutes also some slugma a totodile a chicorita and the evolution of this fire hedgehog
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,electric biome caught more magnemites and voltorbs than pidgeys and eevees here partychus are quite common here with around new spawn every minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all of mine have spawned on campus however i did all my playing yesterday on campus so take it with a grain of salt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one spawned in a water biome here i also got a dratini last night
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so far in what i think is an ice biome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nebraska we are missing fighting ground biomes here no pikachu yet only ever saw one outside of christmas event thanks niantic for not increasing spawn rates
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,havent seen one since the event started and i usually see at least a handful daily there was even a pikachu frequent spawn area that i labeled on the map before the event after verifying it was the same spawn pattern as the previous migration another traveler relabeled as nidoran so i checked it out today and no pikachu there very odd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in a beach town it is no paradise i guess we get water spawns but that is about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive heard about santa monicas beach it is like a paradise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here i just finished my gold pikachu badge the day before the event but havent seen a single one in the last two days in contrast to xmas where they spawned as they do normally
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive only ever even encountered pikachu and caught almost all of those were from the giftmas event been playing since the beginning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,great stuff thank you have to ask again have there been any spawns of tangela or aerodactyl in your data still miss both for my dex and simply cannot find them i feel they just dont exist in munich would be interesting to know in which areas to look for them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,growlithe nest in landschaftspark hachinger tal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you the migration has been such a pain for my hunt all nest in my area munich east have changed to the worse now at least now where to go to again llap
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for all your work my local park lost its nest altogether argh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the new eggcexute nest is so rad i caught of them in just about
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,last week there was an aerodactyl near ostbanof in munich only time i have saw one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you i really should start taking advantage of the nests i always plan to and then they are changed up again d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did not see it on the map but there is a frequent spawn of exeggcute from muffatwerke down the isar until max joseph brücke
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish someone would do this for my area around dortmund essen bochum gelsenkirchen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,most importantly is there a spawn map of snorlax after the update i just cannot seem to find him and have not seen a egg in weeks seriously lost of how to get it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tomorrow from about who knows ill be at bordeaux platz by ostbanhof at poke paradise if any other english speaking people are interested in meeting up shoot me an e mail mediabayerngmailcom and we can trade whats app cool to meet other english speakers here in munich d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey bannnanananaa looking forward to your analysis of the fourth migration cheers from the bordeaux platz
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is an updated map for the available ill visit munich next weekend and will be looking for some bulbasaur squirtle and charmander
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit pokemon nests munich x post footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey there since a lot of germans are here anyone found new spots for stuttgart i had nests i checked from time to time and all seem to be gone that cuts my motivation to play at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only one spawn for both of them in this small dataset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same as you i never saw one in munich suburbs if you have the chance to travel south i can recommend lake garda eg desenzano for tangela found my first one there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hatched both of them form an egg play here a lot and have never seen them wild so i think best chance are eggs or travelling to places with different spawns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also got my tangela from eggs dont think i have seen one in the wild yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can confirm what the other said never saw either in southern germany but got both from eggs this is the reason i spent all my coins on incubators just to have a chance at getting rare stuff
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,samehavent seen any of those in the wild yetsame with porygon and grimer happen to have recent input on those
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,woot you make my day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,glad it helps you out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea a nest right outside my doorstep disappeared as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good to know time to head there this weekend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,way better than mankey as it was with the last migration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,go for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is actually from muffatwerk upwards caught there within huge amount of spawn points there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is at least no point with a spawnchance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that was kind of quick this time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they changed some api stuff so currently not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry only tübingen and can only check after the summer break
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,most nests in dresden seem to have vanished too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well atleast we got that onix nest at eckensee and the scyther spawn at kriegsbergturm which are nice for the next generation the only other good nest change seems to be the charmander nest at karlshöhe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,saw an aerodactyl in munich once
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not too uncommon here the spawns from the dataset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,prygon is actually super common in the whole old town city eg within the circle of odeonsplatz stachus sendlinger tor isartor i already caught i can recommend pokewhere for iphone it gives you a feeling for where things spawn regularly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,np man enjoy some eevees spawn there too also found some elecatbuzzs from time to time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for anyone looking theres a slowpoke nest at olympiapark that isnt on the map i caught a dozen or so yesterday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,north on the map is downstream
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tnx so much that actually kinda helps to see in which areas of the city there is even a chance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh rly o ive never seen it anywhere patroling kaufinger straße xd time to go on the lookout again p tnx
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah totally misread that as just down and not downstream sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its usually either a bit south or a bit north of kaufinger straße did you try the app its amazing for finally finding those rare ones
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like your ideas especially the third suggestion i doubt theyll ever change the duration nor do i think they should giving this game full attention for hours does not appeal to casual players i dont think its a coincidence that lucky eggs lures and incenses all have a duration of minutes if they want to remove evolution sprees from the game they could just buff all xp gains other than evolutions and would be wise to do so when they raise the level cap this doubles as a way to mitigate the grind that turns off casuals as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think they should change the time of a lucky egg to an hour or bonus xp whichever comes first right now the normal lucky egg usage can net around anything above that requires you to have a good phone good internet force close app or multiple devices so being able to get xp total before disappearing would be a buff to those who dont have a good phone and a nerf to those who use dubious methods to squeeze in extra xp best of all it would be less stressful worrying about hitting the right buttons perfectly for a half hour sucks this way you could be more leisurely and you dont have to line up pokemon to evolve you can have fewer than that but evolve while walking around hitting stops and catching other pokemon to hit the bonus cap
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not trying to be rude but for future reference please use the search bar this would have been so easy to find if you searched and helps keep the sub less cluttered with people asking for info that has already been provided
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the cp your prestige is being based off of is the highest cp pokemon in your starting for example if you use a vileplume to take out a vaporeon but your highest in your line up is a dragonite you will only get the prestige for your dragonites level compared to the vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have to choose pokemon lower than the lowest gym pokemon for it to give better prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i found how to search
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try beating the bottom two pick all mons lower than the highest one you are battling ive beaten up to and got gain
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep pokemon that are cp to fill the other slots named for easy finding in az sorting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i figured someone had already talked about it but i dont know how to search and i couldnt find it anywhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks i didnt know how it worked
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokemon indoors awesome thanks for the awesome screenshots
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,silly oddish offices are for people and ficuses
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awesome thank u that raichu looks sick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,woohoo level up packs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh my god why when are you realeasing it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this looks so cool how did the pokemon get inside
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is nobody going to talk about that mega charizard y is that just a random pic within the game or does that confirm megas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,great oh god this anxiety is going to kill me soon niantic this is all your fault
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is that jigglypuff in the back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait did i miss something i thought the places we get free stuff balls berries etc were called pokestops that image says pokemon center
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this looks better than i ever couldve imagined
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that charizard v blastoise screen epic although it seems that blastoise had run through a number of pokemon before getting to the charizard i like charizards chances in that battle based on that screen shot teamchar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on the hype train but why is the oddish inside i thought the point of pogo is to go outside and wonder around get to know your local history and catch pokemon outside its probably a glitch of some sort after all its a beta xd cant really expect to much lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is oddish just the office plant of pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oddish is a future ficus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that looks more like a photo of an actual statue than a part of the game though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,which slide
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that looks to be a pokestop located at the pokemon center store in what i believe is akihabara
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is a poke store in a irl pokemon center you know japan
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well no one said this is from the us beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the us was added to the beta the other regions are still going too and old photos dont magically disappear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is amazing is it your creation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup that seems to be the pokémon center mega tokyo store in sunshine city mall it has some awesome other mega statues such as lucario and mewtwoy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see what you mean rip some hopes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw it it seems to be a toy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and old photos dont magically disappear this are new tough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no all credit goes to zmann
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fyi ive had google opinion rewards for a few years and surveys tend to be fairly sporadic sometimes ill get almost surveys daily then it dries up for a bit sometimes going a month or two at worst without a survey also theres supposedly questions to weed out people who just spam click buttons without legitimately answering them its usually the ones that ask if youve been somewhere recently and will list one place you have been and others you havent
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got in monthsguess its something
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to get a day and now im lucky if i get one a week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,opinion rewards arent a steady stream they send them when they have them sometimes a week sometimes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have also noticed since getting a phone with marshmallow that the rewards do not come as often due to how the os tries to save battery when the screen is off so if you go somewhere that is likely to send out a survey like walmart michaels walgreens maybe make sure to pop over to the rewards app for a bit when going in and you might get more later but of course not always
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sadly doesnt seem to even be a thing in europe at least here in portugal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this doesnt have much to do with pokemon go and silph road maybe randroid would like it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,years now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is some info on it being tied to location services and visiting places like i get surveys for autozone and home dept after i have visited one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as mentioned it was discussed in silph road or wherever since pgo has in app purchases this is relevant because who doesnt like free lucky eggs and revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a lot of people have been discussing opinion rewards on here over the last several months this is where i and probably a lot of other people first heard about it i would say that its relevant
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky people i only got € in two and a half years
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would say increase your bag or pokemon storage or wait until easter if there will be a great deal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it totally depends on your goals for the game if you are just a casual player then buy whatever you want if you want to get into the gym game and earn some real money in the future you should level up as fast as possible i would therefore recommend pidgy grinding and lucky eggs ideally save up for a pack of that pack of should see you through to level no problems
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bag upgrades you need to be able to stock up on items and pokemon the best way to use lucky eggs is a mass evolve when you have at least pokemon you can evolve and enough candy to evolve them all you need extra bag space to facilitate this after that incubators
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awesome clothes of course
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,incubators regardless thats so few coins just have fun with them however u like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after you max out your storages incubators all the way if you under level and cant wait for those max revives i wouldnt blame you throw in a few lucky eggs every now and then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky eggs arent worth it theyre good to level up fairly quickly but incubators are something you can always use buy an incubator
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would go for item pokemon storage you should get a fair amount of lucky eggs trough lvl ups incubators are great but i would safe them until lvl max lvl of incubated pokemon is lvl
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at your level and given you only get coin a day i would prioritize getting to the point where youre getting way more than coins a day before branching out that would mean focusing on lucky eggs when you have enough pokes to do a mass evolve ie only use your lucky eggs when you can get a full set of mins worth of evolutions if you get a few levels higher youll get more than gold a day in gyms hopefully and then be able to start spending coin on incubators and other fancy stuff
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id wait till easter in case there is a cool and snazzy event if there is candy get incubators and hatch as much as you can for that egg candy i did that and got dratini candy in a single hatch otherwise pokemon and item storage is great because its permanent and pokemon storage allows you to save up for mass evolutions and if youve got those maxed out incubators are great for people who care about collecting high iv pokemon like myself and lucky eggs are for people who wanna level faster im at level so no advantage when it comes to catching wild pokemon at higher levels and dont play much in gyms so incubators are what id buy but i only buy them for candy events
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,obviously a fancy new hat or those sweet shades
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hats this is after all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,get that glasses
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,flair checks out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do the incubator have infinite use or just
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are lvl so a good point to go for incubators p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just but thats eggs you would have had to wait longer to incubate its really up to you but personally i would go for the incubators because im not in a rush to level up whats the point of getting all the way up to and then having nowhere else to go lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i like to level up so that i can power up my top gym defenders another level and also for the bonuses it gives you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i enjoy that too but i like to have something to look forward to im almost level and im looking forward to leveling because of the little bonus ill get i dont want to rush up to and then have no bonuses to get and no excitement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mean to each his own getting to level is one my goals and im only a little over of the way there by total xp at xp past level so while one may try to rush to level they do not do it quickly or easily recently ive been able to gain xp every three weeks or so without using any lucky eggs incense or lures and running about two incubators at a time playing maybe hours a day so basically playing casually hours a day but still evolving pidgeys and stuff nets me xp every three weeks at that rate it would still take me two years to get to level so i wouldnt worry about getting to level too fast
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,jeezi cant imagine getting that much xp my other issue is i live in a very rural area and play casually i catch everything i can catch and evolve all the pidgeys but i dont get much at all i think thats why its more excitement for me as well and im not setting a goal to level last i checked i wasnt going to get to level until i think
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i imagine being a rural player makes it pretty hard to get mass xp gains
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes the maximum legit level reachable for a pokemon through normal usage of the ui is which is possible when you are level and power it once now if somebody sees your level pokemon in a gym he can report you to niantic who will send the fbi and local police to your house all equipped with high grade banhammers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope glitch is not fixed at least not for lower levels i just hit lv a few hours ago and powered up my lv vaporeon to lv using the two client trick if its fixed then it must be only past not at lower levels has it always been this way when people reached level that you couldnt powerup your pokemon any further to the max until you reached level nope power up button disappears at trainer level when you hit pokemon lv thats it the end no more power ups not even at by using the two client trick you could get to but thats it maybe you just got a network issue on one client you should definitely try it again with another pokemon sorry if i took the wind out of your sails for the sprint to dont let this discourage you they will probably fix it soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is the wrong sub to be asking for forgiveness for abusing a glitch just delete your account start over and all will be forgiven
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for this info i just assumed that level was reachable for all pokemon seeing as that is what is always shown in pogo gamepress all the level breakdown charts and basically every pogo article that cites cp now i know better and will forever cherish my precious pokemon p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you might be able to three client from to or two client from to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gotcha they must have fixed the glitch where you can power up a pokemon past level to level which i didnt even realize was the maximum until right now makes sense now i have nothing to look forward to with level except for my lucky egg reward the grind is just too crazy without a coinciding event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was thinking someone needs to try three client from to that would be awesome if it works
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your pokemon are hitting level where cp gains get cut in half
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this will happen to every pokemon once it hits level not just vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup fyi you can power up a pokemon up to above your trainer level so you op at level can level a pokemon to going from to is when you get your first half cp power up they are alllll like that on up to it seems like a bummer at first but the cp gap between high level and lower level trainers would be really big without that diminishing return
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you didnt know that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does this mean i should start powering up mine im level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also will the number of candies needed for the next power up be a good hint as to whether the cp gain is cut in half i cant recall exactly but good idea in general to keep an eye on how many candies are needed for the next power up usually then it bumps up to needing candies then then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the limit relates to the pokémon level not the trainer level there is no hurry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you could still catch slightly higher level pokemon but youre right around the level where you could certainly invest in powering up pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes but you have to pay attention as you do it when the pokemon hits it will show stardust and candy so your first two at that range will be full powerups and the next will be half if you wild catch at you wont know what level it is based solely on the listed candydust the best way to be safe is to use an iv calculator pokiegenie if on ios to determine the exact current level of your pokemon and it will tell you what cp it will be when it is exactly level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awesome tips thanks for the clarification
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,prestiger vaporeon is a better water attacker for sure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,isnt starmie the better attacker but with much lower hp than vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well thats the highest dps water type that there is so you can either keep it around as a quick prestiger or max it out for quickly killing any waterrockground types in gyms although it is a lot more squishy than vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only two as a prestige attacker ie pokemon for training in friendly gyms given its lower cp cap specifically against fire types as a gift to the professor cough one candy cough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hate you so much i have over candy and have evolved probably staryu looking for wghpnot one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks sitting on eevee candy waiting for that elusive fish lady
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,starme has stronger attack base stats vape is more tanky if you can dodge you will notice it can take down your rhydon arcanine charizard etc quicker than vaporeon does with almost twice its cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe starmie has the highest attack of a watertype pokemon and can learn water gunhydro pump two of the best water moves with perfect dodging starmie may be slightly better than vape
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the cp recommendation how exactly does one prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youre going to do thatwhich i wouldnt with a nearly perfect starmie at least use it as an attacker until it feints or throw it in a gym you dont expect to keep before you grind it up may as well save yourself a couple of potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got a wing attack hurricane pidgeot my first attempt too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont have a vaporeon yet name the eevee rainer and it will become a vaporeon when you evolve it that works only once though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a starme maxed to my level cp with wghp and i find that it wipes out the same opponents as vaporeon in half the time if you can dodge i feel the higher attack stat makes up for the difference in stamina just my opinion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,prestiging is training up a friendly gym to get more spaces for team members pokemon because the formula favours lower cp pokemon as attackers you get prestige for beating a pokemon of the same cp and prestige for beating a pokemon of double cp or more and the norm for a gym defender is you want something around to train against the gym for optimal rewards although if you are quite a low level currently i wouldnt worry about it too much as the cp of the defenders in a gym is scaled down to your level when you train against it if i were you i would just keep it as an attacker without powering it up if youve not already got a good water type as youll likely find another better pokemon on your journey that is naturally a higher level and good moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pick a mon with a super effective move and about half the cp of the defender
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to prestige is to train a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,die
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id suggest not doing this if youre a little new someday youll have that level eevee you really want to make a vaporeon and youll wish youd saved the name trick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,already used that trick months ago before i knew anything about the meta accidentally transferred it prefavorite feature
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so take a gym throw in a flareon defender go to town on it with my starmie attacker profit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,too bad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thatll do it another good one is using gyarados as a defender and jolteon as an attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you have the option try to use lower cp pokemon so it doesnt last as long like a cp flareon and a cp starmie
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this post would be more appropriate for rpokemongo the general pokemon go subreddit cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i posted there sorry for the trouble caused keep up the good work with the datamine dronpes u rock
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no worries friend thanks for understanding
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just so i dont do it again in the future what kind of posts are suited for this sub i like discussing with people here more than on pokemongo since they seem more knowledgeable overall
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the road is primarily a place for discussion of game mechanics and building the silph road network we sometimes allow a few discussion during slow news periods when theyre constructive and novel we stay away from purely editorial posts or posts that might cause too much drama or division this post would fall under that category as its less about the mechanics of an mmo as it is about the comments folks have made about whether theyd like new content to come or not its just a little light on information and more of an opinion piece nothing wrong with that but itd be more fitting for the general pogo sub instead of the road where we keep things pretty infofocused hope that helps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes many of the spawns changed both near me and at my office not a wholesale change but im seeing different pokemon starting yesterday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cool you should post this on the southwest subreddit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey friend we actually remove locationspecific posts as they tend to snowball into an avalanche d these type of posts would definitely be appreciated in the us southwest regions subreddit though and it looks like you found it already cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did as a comment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can only hatch a regional if you got the egg in that area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea if you get the egg in asia
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea i can as im in japan although its one of the only i havnt hatched if your not in asia though then no you cant was confirmed by nintic boss man on twitter awhile back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,edit silph road content policy for many months our subreddit has been a hub for the roads development plansupdates and a place for deeper discussion about the game in general we remove photo posts eg look what i just caught and frequently asked beginner questions if you have questions about pokemon go basics check our sidebar search we have a wealth of information available in historical posts here or if youd prefer to get an answer to your specific question click the discord link in our sidebar and head to the bootcamp channel where helpful travelers are standing by to answer questions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not asia per se farfetchd only spawns on confirmed asian countries japan hongkong taiwan other asian countries like singapore malaysia philippines dont have this regional pokemon hopefully on gen there are regional pokemons on other countries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,information about pokemongo youre right silphroad is definitely not the right place for that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for asking easytogooglequestions and
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dear cardashian if the quote above one about the silphroads creators asking not to post already answered questions as new threads didnt make you reconsider then probably nothing will it took me less than a minute to find a research and a statement by hanke using the search tool both of them on the first page of the search results have an amazing day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope your current progress toward the next candy will reset your total distance walked with that pokemon will stay the same though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you answered the question i was trying to ask i have walked with my dragonair and id hate for that to reset to if i switch it out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just tried this too bad that total distance is not connected to pokemon type i want to walk with the one i power up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ps it will reset after evolving edit just evolved my buddy and utazzzje is absolutely right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually the total distance traveled didnt reset for me when i evolved my dratini buddy into a dragonite yesterday it still shows the km i walked with it when it was just a dratini however you will lose the progress youve made towards your next candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,been curious about this did you evolve from the buddy screen or from your poke bag ive got a ponyta i wantneed to evolve but i dont want to lose her progress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used the buddy screen but the progress on your candy will disappair tho but the total amount walked will stay i evolved mine when it was at or or so almost no loss for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks ill make sure to do that when i evolve mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre welcome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in the past i have reported accounts all owned by the same couple for both gps cheating and offensive nicknames they have had to change their nicknames but theyre still around cheating every night so now im just going to annoying niantic by reporting them every night when they take gyms in a row in under minutes that actually require more than combine minutes of walking not including the drive needed to get between them its a minimum minute trip between car and walking because of no car access at night
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so apparently the original link was removed but this is what happened my friend was started fighting in gyms since this past weekend during a lure party in one of the chicago suburbs using a controversial nickname on sunday he went to downtown chicago and the nearby mexican neighborhood to start painting many of the gyms yellow by monday he received an email from nianticops claiming such nickname is not allowed and he will need to change it during the next time he logs on to the game i highly doubt this is done completely by computer there must be some sort of human intervention if that is the case then we know that there is indeed customer service for niantic only if the right issue exists there are already proof that certain support tickets such as ban appeals gets deleted automatically by their support system
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude if that gets rid of one specific spoofer ive reported consistently i will gild you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perfect timing for your post i was about to ask how to report them there is a group of three that takes over the gyms in our neighborhood every night in minutes flat unless they are capable of teletransportation there is no way to cover the distance between the gyms in that time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,given the screenshot it seems like your friend was spoofing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you friend is not really smart because of reasons his nickname making a screenshot with obvious spoofingapps activated what your friend needs is a perma bann no name change filthy spoofer and you play together with those cheater amazing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are already proof that certain support tickets such as ban appeals gets deleted automatically by their support system link
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can try it and see if that works the turnaround time in our example above is less than hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,remember this only gurantees that a human will look at your report in shortest amount of time whether if they are going to take action is another matter they might queue the account for ban for the next ban wave so dont expect immediate result
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for the amount of cheating that occurs its probably a royal pain to check each account that is reported for cheating joystick users in particular that only go at walking speed to slightly extend their reach say just down a block or so are probably stupid hard to detect as cheating unless they regularly do something like walk across the freeway where there isnt a bridge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how do you see that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see you are from europe in america we have the first amendment which protects free speech second i show him about what you said he indicates that it is a throwaway account what he is trying to do is to send a message just like painting buddhist symbols 卍 on random walls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hes using niantics lack of replies as proof even though its not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a family in my area that cheats only enough to not get out of the car ive seen them pull up and take gyms from across the street they make a habit of putting low cp kangaskhanfarfetchedmime in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a compass looking icon with wings on it i dont want to name the app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see a little joystick thing in the upper right corner so probably that lame
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see you are from europe in america we have the first amendment which protects free speech same in every other civilized country d while i dont understand the sense of your comment when did i try to forbit any free speech anyway we at least try to not abuse the right of free speech for every nonsense that comes in our mind second i show him about what you said he indicates that it is a throwaway account what he is trying to do is to send a message just like painting buddhist symbols in blackjewish neighborhoods what kind of message that sending a message to change the name is much easier to automatize by simply checking for words like heilh and other inappropriate stuff than perma banning people by reports result of his message some may use the inappropriate namefeature to report players the system will not find any checksum and an employee has to check it manually congratulations normal reports take even longer finally he still remains a spoofer i bet the majority does not care if he uses his main or a throwaway account while i would not believe him not spoofing with his main p edit checking your other comments regarding thirdpartytools i dont think you understood what the sr stands for neither the rpokemongodev
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bottom rightyou mean
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope upper right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that is just a circle in the upper right there is a joystick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not just a circle i didnt see the dpad shape in the top right until i zoomed but i think they are both joysticks bottom right you can see the square with the dual circles like a joystick and the dpad top right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,considering how hard it is to heal them at this point i wouldnt want to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really hope this becomes an option at some point thus far go reminds me a lot of pokemon rumble world in that among other things you cant nickname your mon and you keep replacing them with stronger ones as you progress i think its very possible that this will change over time fingers crossed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no customization options exist outside of a few clothing options for your avatar naming pokemon would only make sense if you could create parties or heal in a more traditional way pokemon centers who knows how close to the original games niantic wants to go so its up in the air if such a feature will be implemented
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no at least not yet its unknown if theyll add it in the future but its a common thing people ask for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why once you find a stronger cp one youll drop the old one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe it will be a micro transaction
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes by now it will appear in the new patch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really i just let them die and revive them since its not a nuzlocke and i have max revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hang on whats the process of healing pokemon now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know why you got down votes but this seems like a good feature to place as a micro transaction naming a pokemon is not fundamental to game play and provides personal satisfaction
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spacemaanspiff i think people down voted because they hate the concept of micro transactions that being said this would be such a reasonable micro transaction since like you said it doesnt effect the fundamentals of the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup usually easier to use a max revive than to waste a super potion especially if youre grinding gym prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no pokécenters you have to farm up potions and revives from pokéstops to heal them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think people down vote because im from usa to be honest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,alright since no one has mentioned it heres why everything looks off nbsp the site takes into account critical hits nbsp stone edge cross chop too has high critical hit rate but nbsp critical hits are not implemented yet and mean nothing as of the current version nbsp end of story
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my kabutops regularly beats out much stronger pokemon being one of my better noncore attackers i have mudshot instead of fury cutter which means my primary attack is actually really effective for damage in its own right which helps i should head up the marina and grab myself another kabuto to work on try for fury cutter as long as it brings stone edge im golden
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know the game seems to love it it frequently offers up my kabutops as an option alongside vaporeon with hundreds more cp and in fights where i wouldnt expect it to be a good match and mine has water pulse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like the typing of both kabutops and omastar they definitely have a place in the meta its just unfortunate that they dont get double rock moves if they had that they would be a lot better and the go too attackers against ice and fire pokemon i dont think they deserve a high ranking as attackers as is though they are usable but far from the best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the formula they use to do their simulations seems very simple i think using professor kukuis data particularly the duel ability if you are a nondodger or a poor dodger is more accurate and if you do those simulations kabutops is not the best counter against any pokemon normalized for cp or otherwise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a kabutops at with fury cutter stone edge and he holds well against dragonitelaprasgyarados fury cutter does pitiful damage but the eps allows to spam stone edge he could already defeat dragonites when he was at and i used him not long ago at to prestige against a lapras if the ai doesnt use blizzard right away you have enough time to make lapras eat stone edge and be charging the third at worst you can get stone edge in and have the second charged in time to release it after dodging blizzard the only problem is that you need to dodge almost everything hes a bit of a glass cannon and he probably cant take multiple higher cp dragoniteslapras on his own is the limit since i got a lapras and a dewgong i dont really use him in attack but hes still a great solution for training edit i hope the criticals get implemented someday then stone edge spam will become incredibly brutal might even come back into my attack team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it looks like the key is the eps of fury cutter being able to charge up stone edge quickly which gives it more dps in the seconds even though some of the pokemon look a little odd to me i think it is worth checking out the one i have the most experience with is machamp with karate chopcross chop he is always my number choice against lapras and snorlax because i have found him to be very effective at that role these simulations certainly support that observation people keep telling me how much trash machamp is but i find him to be an offensive star the simulations say the same thing so it certainly has my attention
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if the kabutops had mud shot stone edge it would do a lot of damage to dragonite and electrics its rock typing on defense will also protect it from some of the damage dealt by electrics but could make it weak to steel wing dragonite related question is there any niche use for fury cutter water pulse kabutops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ohhh that would definitely explain it especially in conjunction with the super high eps of fury cutter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just evolved mudshotrockslide omastar what do you recommend me to do with it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax with zen headbutt is definitely a challenge no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rock does not resist electric aerodactyl is weak to electrics bc of this just as a side note
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh man electrics lol i havent seen an electric in a gym the entire time ive been playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,steel wing dragonite doesnt do too bad water resists steel so you end up only taking a dragonite to the face only i find the biggest issue to be dragonite resisting mudshot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also since it lists machamp as a top attacker i just want to share my favorite fact regarding battling in pokemon go bellsprout vine whipsludge bomb does more dps to normal types than machamp karate chopcross chop granted machamp has far more bulk but he isnt actually a viable attacker no matter what target you pick or is at least really bad compared to a lot of other options source i ran calculations via qmikes spreadsheet edit hold up i looked at the numbers again and im actually wrong bellsprout only does more dps than machamp to neutral targets my bad there are still movesets on various pokemon that still outdamage machamp vs normal types vaporeon w hydro pump being the most notable and easy to obtain one machamp only has of the effective hp of vaporeon and thats without taking type weaknesses into account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my perfect kabutops ended up having water pulse so ive gone with my stone edge instead
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its probably not worth leveling up right now but it would still make a great attacker against fire and ice types
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not as bad as you would think that is what i was worried about at first but machamp is a lot more tanky than one would expect he goes toe to toe with cp zen ones without me dodging the headbutts obviously i have to dodge the charged attacks tho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought that was because it was flying type
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good call edited
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen a few beefed electrabuzz holding spots but im not a fully urban player either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i throw my jolteon in sometimeswhen it puts me at least from the bottom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the reason machamp is so weak is not because of his attack stat which is fairly decent its just that karate chop and cross chop yes are abysmal moves karate chop ties for worst dps quick move right after splash and cross chop only does damage for a full bar charge move the fact that its listed dps is the highest for any charge moves means nothing since it doesnt take into account the time it takes to fully charge the attack i could reply to that other guy with this stuff but im lazy p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and let me ask you thiswhat do you think of snorlax with lick as an attacker the true dps of lick on snorlax is the same as karate chop on machamp i ask this because you use the bellsprout example bellsprout may have better dps but it simply cannot handle being hit the same goes for alakazam the dps of psycho cut is amazing but that doesnt do you much good if you faint right away that would mean that snorlax is only a good attack because he is able to absorb a lot of damage so being a good attacker is a combination of dealing damage and being able to take hits you can compare bellsprout and machamp but they reality is that they are not in the same ball park because bellsprout cannot take a hit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i bet the person that down voted me has never actually battled with a machamp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if rock resist electric the penalty would be balanced out so that he is not weak to electric move like how lapras is neutral to fire
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anyway sorry for the random rant but ive looked at these numbers a bunch and i wanted to clear up some misconceptions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i read it i have also heard this before i did say some of the stuff seemed odd and the critical hit would certainly explain it i couldnt figure out why stone edge kept showing up on there that still doesnt change the fact that machamp is very effective for me when used against lapras and snorlax im sure part of that is his bulk he can absorb a lot of damage you also have to consider he is se against the pokemon i am using him against i ask have you actually used one or are you just looking at the numbers a cp machamp works very well for me you might point out that he is a higher level than most of the defenders and that is trueas it is with any of my attackers i choose to use
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax lick hyper beam lick body slam lick earthquake less dps than zen headbutt hyper beam or body slam machamps karate chop cross chop is nbsp lickhyper beam ranks out of all possible movesets on every pokemon in dps snorlaxs effective hp however is higher than dragonites and higher than machamps tied with arcanine effective hp takes into account both hp and defense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and let me ask you thiswhat do you think of snorlax with lick as an attacker the true dps of lick on snorlax is the same as karate chop on machamp you forgot to account for eps which makes moves like lick and bite so effective when paired with a effective charge move like hyperbeam instead of the limpdick cross chop bite lick kchop edit if you want a proper discussion please account for all variables preferably with a spreadsheet to justify what you say
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i fixed that for you because i hate bitter people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think the problem with machamp is he can get so many non stab moves mine has no fighting moves and i had to walk him to get him i was sad that day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you also have to consider he is se against the pokemon i am using him against and half the snorlaxes are se against him i ask have you actually used one or are you just looking at the numbers same question you need to ask yourself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i already have taken into account super effectiveness vs lapras and snorlax there are still movesets on various pokemon that still outdamage machamp vs normal types vaporeon w hydro pump being the most notable and easy to obtain one machamp only has of the effective hp of vaporeon and thats without taking type weaknesses into account all of this is number theory based on qmikes sheet and assuming pokemon are equal levels i have not used a machamp in battle nor have i even obtained one yet let alone with karate chopcross chop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to me i actually have no idea what these numbers actually mean and are solely a way for comparing pokemon heh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for that that says exactly what i thought it would snorlax isnt exactly the best pokemon for attacking which i figured out very early on with my lickeq one obviously eq is the worst moveset but a lot of it was due to lick the thing lick does have going for it is the higher eps the key is the effective hps that is what makes snorlax a good attacker the same goes for vaporeon even tho his offensive numbers are much more impressive that is why comparing machamp to bellsprout isnt fair you said machamp is tied with arcanine for effective hpobviously arcanine has a much better attack stat one of the best in the game i assume but no one questions arcanines surviveability in battle while used on offense obviously defense is another story arcanine seems to play as a pretty sturdy pokemon machamp is the same way this all needs to be taken into consideration i am not sure what you think of this battle simulatori just found this tool the other day im not sure how accurate it is but i put in the info for a real battle i had this was a battle against a zen headbutt snorlax using my machamp i set it to dodge specials because i was able to dodge both of his eq attempts this is pretty close to how it played out in real lifemachamp won easily
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is your reason for being so rude you act like i have insulted you and i wasnt even talking to you if you are going to be suck a condescending jerk you should at least get your numbers correct httpspokemongogamepressggquickmoves eps of lick eps of karate chop if you dont like those numbers you can take them up with that website a very commonly used resource on these pages
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are a few pokemon that way i got lucky and got the best moveset my first try the last one i just evolved has karate chopstone edge stone edge doesnt get stab but it isnt horrible damage wise gamepress has it rated as a b moveset compared to cross chop which is an a stone edge is se against lapras so it might be worth investing in that as opposed to hoping i get lucky with cross chop on my next evolution after my golem and second blastoise with biteflash cannon i made the decision that i would only walk pokemon that dont have a bad moveset or at least ended up with a moveset i would be okay with so much time and effort wasted on pokemon with bad movesets
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i need to ask myself if i have actually used one i have
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the much kinder reply i have heard of qmikes spreadsheet so i know the numbers are reliable but i have found with this game that it is more than just numbers some pokemon just have a better feel or allow people to get into a dodging rhythm some moves are also easier than others to dodge there is much more to the game than straight dps this leads to this point you said qmikes spreadsheet assumes both pokemon are equal levels well my machamp is most likely a higher level than the defenders so there is that to consider the reason i asked if you have ever used one is because i do every day you are using theory based on numbers i am giving my opinion based on a lot of experience using him he isnt this horrible pokemon that your numbers make him out to be he goes toe to toe with any snorlax or lapras providing i dodge the charge attacks besides that i often miss the dodges and he can take a couple of ice beams and still come out on top all i am saying is that i find him a very good counter for those pokemon even with his weakness to zen headbutt am i going to argue that vaporeon isnt a better options against snorlax of course not there is a reason vaporeon has a reputation for being one of the best pokemon in the game but part of that is due to vaporeons hps so with machamp it obviously has a lot more to do with other factors than his damage output
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just want to clarify again that machamp is not horrible but he is suboptimal because his moves are so inefficient comparing machamp to bellsprout was just me stating a silly fact bellsprout is not a viable attacker though he can be a valid prestiger
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sweet now you are getting serious now answer the second part about cross chop vs hyper beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,by equal levels i mean attackers being equal levels to each other machamp is not in fact a horrible pokemon but he is suboptimal compared to much more easily obtainable pokemon in terms of both dps and effective hp there are more numbers that arent included in qmikes spreadsheet since none of it factors in dodging time of quick move animation time of charge move animation and warning time of defenders charge move karate chops cooldown is seconds if you go here httpspokemongogamepressggquickmoves and sort by cooldown ascending there are many moves that have quicker cooldowns most notably water gun at however cross chop has the quickest cooldown of any charge move in the game even considering all of the smaller bar charge moves that part is perhaps current machamps biggest strength because of that he can much more easily dodge every attack that the defender throws at him but yes i only know the numbers and i have not used machamp myself that said if you find him to work better as an attacker if youre comfortable using him and you like doing that then you should keep doing that and you dont need to let anyone stop you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im going to go with hyper beam d that being saidi dont have a snorlax with lickhyper beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for all of the info and explaining it in a respectful way he may not be the most optimal pokemon but i like his feel and he is very effective for me if they every do add critical hits that could be a game changeri wonder if that would change the metaif they simply applied critical strikes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup so of things need to happen if niantic wants to improve the spread of pokemon implement critspeed implement special attack stat bonuses actually change up the damage values again for certain moves and will move fighting lightning and rock types up immediately worse case do though it just means someone else will occupy the bottom slot more variables should be included to widen a spread instead of the current layer system lick body slam works as well in about of the cases hyper beam will result in overkill wasted energy and charge while body slam can be fitted in very nicely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,indeed it would and i expect it to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does seem like this could be a thing i had a nest after migration that appeared to spawn diglett in day mode but spinarak after dark
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,supposedly theres one around here in a park that closes at dusk naturally i dont mind the concept as it could give you twice the variety per week and thematically make sense for dark typesthough some tweaks would be a good idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nocturnal nests is a bad idea could contribute to people trying to go in parks that are closed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the info it actually happened for days now for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree but i woke up at to go to school and passed library and noticed it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,chill repelghosts wasnt using tentative language to imply that you might be mistaken this night time nests thing is a new idea that were hearing about but which has not had a lot of research on yet we like to consider things carefully here without jumping to conclusions we appreciate your contribution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this idea has been posted several times before just so you know the silph road is just a fanmade website for tracking pokemon and studying game mechanics the game is actually made by professional programmers and game designers at company called niantic the people here on reddit wouldnt be able to implement your idea in the game even if they wanted to you might have better luck posting your idea in rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my opinion this thread could belong here it is well written and tsr has many members that dont read every day i am against posting ideas here when they are bad written or just to solve a problem of op in this case it is something to add to the game even if it is suggested before this is way better that another psa revive trick doesnt work anymore tried it on pokemon or psa i found a dratini here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,he did
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah you are not wrong though ive never seen anything about cooldowns i think but i dunno the guys at niantic browse these subreddits sometimes even if its just for finding pretty inspiring stories and a few ingame things like egg colours or mass transfers were discussed in reddit way before they were implemented fat chance yes but well edit on the other hand sharing and discussing ideas just for the fun of it is a thing too though maybe this is not the sr for that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fair enough i would disagree though and argue that fluff posts even wellwritten ones like this that arent about the actual game are better suited to rpokemongo along with the screenshots rant threads and screenshots of pokemon licking each others butts that being said theres no rule against idea threads here but since op asked for my opinion i shared it i wouldnt want op getting their hopes up that someone will read their idea and put it into the game though if anything posting ideas publicly does the exact opposite since it can open up companies to legal liability relating to prior art we know folks at niantic occasionally keep tabs on this subreddit one of the official pogo troubleshooting faqs was based on a psa thread but this is not their suggestion bin
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get your arguments new ideas and experiences are indeed not the main goal for this sub however i think it is necessary for some to express new ideas in this group and if there werent shitposts like there are now i dont think anyone would mind a post like this sadly there are many shitposts so ideas will be on top of those and thats just to much in an ideal world ideas could have a place in tsr but since this wont be the case many will be against them i would even say i agree with you for most of them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,posting ideas publicly does the exact opposite since it can open up companies to legal liability relating to prior art huh really hmm i didnt think of that thanks for pointing it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have an old atrix that runs kit at and it runs fine you cant do any th in else even returning to the home screen will force the app to restart but of its going its going the specs are cores and gb of ram
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably the lack of ram iphone was the last iphone with ram youll probably need to upgrade thanks to that limitation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah my old galaxy still serves me well but in order to play decently i have to stop all background processes and i can fight a gym more or less ok if i dont do that i start with half hp and its almost imposible to play and fight im not an experts in ios since ive never had an iphone but in options look for something to restrict background data maybe it would improve performance also i really hope niantic improves game for older devices but i dont think is going to happen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this has been known for several days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my experience differs from that of countless other people who have provided irrefutable proof of changes in game mechanics that im still claiming to be untrue so im gonna go on reddit and trash niantic anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre just having bad luck ive gotten quite a few babies and im gettingseeing a lot more starters not as many as id like but more than usual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hatch rate of gen never increased lol how would you know that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my baby hatch rate almost doubled from to ive seen plenty of starters today probably as many as id normally see in two months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hatched all before event except cleffa now have in total
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,starters started today all over the place plus evolved as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is working for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im only missing one baby no flop here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught more bulbasaurs today than ive seen since i started no fail here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got of the baby pokemon last week bringing me up to all several in triplicate i organized a huntinglure party last night and pulled dozens of starter pokemon including a blastoise yesterday afternoon possibly unrelated i got my first wild lapras on christmas day and my first wild dragonite last night my experience is that the event has fully delivered in spades even
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can provide proof of that the changes in game mechanics have not changed in my area so i am asking other people on reddit if anyone else is having the same problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not sure why you were down voted for one ive also noticed more babies i didnt hatch any before they increased it and have hatched more with less eggs im also now swimming in squirtle candies and my charazard is finally well fed my venasaur was already fat but i have excess food for im now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because i played the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah but dont advertise an increase in starters if it isnt true everywhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not in my town i am seeing less starters than usual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to see several balbasuars a day here they are relatively common i didnt see a single one today
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not everyone is getting that experience the event has not changed a single thing for some people do not advertise an event as being real if it doesnt apply to all players also lapras and dragonite are not part of the event but since the actual event description was wrong who knows what niantic is doing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,he got downvoted because not everyone is seeing an increase in starters i have been seeing less starters since the event started
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,except it is youre using less than a day of anecdotal crap to disprove a claim
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the event has barely started dont draw conclusion yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,come hang at my house im having a new years eve party and we can hunt starts together tomorrow unless youre under yey for the legal drinking limit to be in the uk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but the increase in gen hatches was supposed to last a week and that never happened either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,far too early to say i agree but i havent seen any starters either only thing ive noticed is an increase in caterpie none for ages three in the last few hours but thats hardly significant rng etc so it might not apply absolutely everywhere i expect to find them at pokestops later we shall see
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey friend we remove specific phone hardware checks from the main sub as they tend to encourage an avalanche of such requests cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sigh no it wont work read the faq or use the search bar it only works with the newest gameboy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh sorry i did not know that thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i searched before posting but i didnt find anything about it other than the article i talked about in this post that says most of the phones wont run it if you could kindly link me to an informative thread i would be very thankful thanks for your answer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you got trolled
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,used my incense today got a squirtle that ran away plus three weedles score definitely use them if you got em but i dont recommend buying them for this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id recommend not using your incense since starters are everywhere now and theyre nestable species better wait for an event with rarer pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats i just tried incense at home while i cleaned out my storagebad rng for me tonight nothing but the usual cast of characters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i think this is dependent on your area im getting about starter in every incense spawns not exactly stellar but more than i usually get
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also not pictured a golbat squirtle and a few growlithes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive managed to get like squirtles and bulbasaurs from using incense at home as well as a charizard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how much rarer can you get well ok there was a lapras event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my incenses were indeed useful during the lapras event im still keeping some in case of an another rare pokemon event snorlax chansey or if the legendaries release is somewhat biome related
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when was the lapras event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it was a few weeks ago but it was only in a certain area of japan it was a sponsored event to encourage tourism
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it was from november to november in a northen area in japan away from tokyo lapras was spawning all over the place and had a much increased chance to spawn from lures and incense used there too went there and got lapras in hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mean same as bubblestrat this is great to get gym level upbut then once you get it to the first attacker will knock you out of the gym in my experience this strat has never kept me in a gym past hours or even close to that long in a suburban area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you can get enough pokes for this strat surely you can find a poke with a slower attack than fury cutter you may want to play around theres been a shift with the recent cp reshuffling so people are still discovering new bubblestrat contenders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for updating post for mod i have used this furystrat and retested again yesterday i have a scyther and paras on file for this strat i attack them with pigeot and pidgeottos with air slash andor wing attack potion every two or three rds having depth in options is always good thanks again for sharing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,before bubble strat i effectively did saomething like this with a big magikarp as defender and a mankeypikachughastly half its cp around splash was so weak you just needed something that could kill it fast enough to only get struggled once and the attackers only needed one potion per fight sometimes per fights ofc bubble requires just the occasional revive if theres something behind the bubble defender and you didnt run fast enough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i recently did something similar but only needed potion every fights i used a cp karp to defend and an cp voltorb with sparkdischarge to attack i could always use discharge once and spam spark to kill the karp before it used struggle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bubblestrat was nerfed hard and is barely viable anymore having to select pokemon while i like your strat i just dont think its viable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is terrible lol this is basically the bubble strat but having to use potions after every fight the key to bubblestratting is not having to use any resources why go through the effort in preparing for this when finding low level horsea is that much easier also its been proven that gastly bellsprout and magnemite work great against horseas after the cp changes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im in a suburban area surrounded by urban centers usually this buys me about days before the defender is kicked out and then half the time the gym has not fallen and can be hardened into a high level fortress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well dual box like everyone else then bubble defender on alt account i know thats against the rules but its what folks be doing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to be honest this strat was made for fast attacks hence fury cutter being one of the fastest and the weakest the strat survived the cp shift so i wanted to throw it out to all as an alternative i agree its not better that bubblestrat but for my area it is has been advantage for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like this now only to find said pokemon im lvl and have only caught magikarp most from nests including from eggs had to buddy one to end up with a gyarados with twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont understand why youre being downvoted this is totally the case i could not agree more with your statement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,prestiging overall has been nerfed hard but bubblestrat together with similar strategies like the one presented by op is still the most efficient way to gain prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well if everything you have on the bubble account except the defender and the attacker are fainted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is a lot easier if you rename your attackers so even though you have to pick it is not a hassle when you only have pokemon named or like op mentioned and you sort by name
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bubblestrat also requires specific pokemon that are not easily found in my area and a very precise setup this allows for prestige gains at the maximum rate with a small amount of resources using resources that are most commonly discarded and with a much wider range of pokemon it also helps to utilize the paras that have become common in many other places after the halloween event i suspect that there are other pokemon that may work as well for defenders bubblestrat also had the advantage of defenders being able to maintain a gym against an attacker something that after the prestige changes is now impossible as a side note since gyms were updated to have attackers while training i have only seen bubblestrat used times out of over gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh all my magnemite became too high cp wthe changes my former bubblestrat horsea also dropped to too low sadly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have some perfect bubblestrat candidates but have never even tried using them its far more worthwhile to just train up against a high cp arcanine or dragonite both easy to prestige against at max prestige if you are the only defender train it all the way to in one go before anyone else adds anything same as bubblestrat costs more potions sure but at least you end up with a strong mon in the gym rather than a
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see the beauty of bubble and all the other options identified here httpspokemongogamepressggbubblestratpossibilities is that the defenders fast attack is so slow that the attacker can kill the defenders before they can get their first attack off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nothing wrong with twister man twister is basically spammed constantly which is way better than gyarados using bite at all is much much harder and more annoying to dodge than hydro pump or even dragon pulse i find that since i always dodge hps and dps from most dos i face twister dos end up doing more damage to me than any other moveset because im usually not dodging twister and he isnt using bite as much which is god awful on defense for the other moves he uses bite a lot more to charge up but twister is almost always charged
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess its because its not a bubblestrat defender ones that make it on to that list require no potionrevive no matter how many times you prestige op made it clear this is not the case rather an alternative for those that cant get the required mons so that at least they can save on revives still using potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because this doesnt meet the criteria for bubblestrat is not bubblestrat and bubblestrat is not the point of the post ops post has value outside of bubblestrat for those who cannot garner bubblestratcapable mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since this is my primary prestige method i also have all my attackers favorited and sort by favorites for furystrat all my defenders furystrat and otherwise are marked with a is for my suicide squad and that comes out on top when sorted az
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have magnemite perfectly in the spots when sorted by name so i can select them as fast as possible still that takes a lot longer than just selecting pokemon like before hence why i said it was nerfed hard i still use bubblestrat its just not as good as it used to be
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how does defenders being able to maintain a gym against an attacker have to do with anything this fury strat is worse than bubble strat in every way you actually end up transferring your hard found cp attackers madness your only acceptable argument is that there are no bubble strat pokemon around your area which im not sure i believe if you are from socal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ideally you get a cp magnemite with spark how can horsea have dropped horseas got a cp boost from the changes my bubble strat horseas which used to be from are now cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this strat was partially born of running out of revives and stardust for over a month its faster for me to level up the gym let my parasect be chipped out also gauging the oppositions interest for that gym and then do a small prestige gain to put in a high cp pokemon hopefully different and complementary to the rest of the gym like adding a vaporeon to a tower of golems and rhydons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah it sounds like this is taking the opposite approach bubble is very strong but its so slow you can kill them before it hits you fury cutter on the other hand is very weak its blazing fast when used for attacking but the defender ai is not going to spam it like a human would so even a cp pokemon can just absorb the hits and kill the defender before taking lethal damage its an interesting idea but i think ill stick to bubblestrating ive been trying to find an updated bubblestrat matchup doc since the cp changes but i dont think one exists
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm ill remember that when i get spare stardust right now im trying to max everything useful with ivs and a decent moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,now i understand your point and that is probably the reason why op gave the whole thing the furystrat name to differentiate from bubblestrat nevertheless not all bubblestrat combinations work perfectly or at least they require very precise ivs especially after the most recent cp changes which messed up many bubblestrat combinations i consider the data presented by op very valuable information that should be spread and better looked into and where better than directly with the guys of gamepress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly im also trying to use everything the pokestops are giving me without wasting or throwing them away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you only transfer them if their statsmoveset arent high enough to take down the defender before the cp shift i had over attackers now im down to but i already have new recruits to try the only time i revive is if i make a mistake or major lag occurs even then the game makes me win once lag has cleared the defenders working on a gym made it possible for an actively defended gym to never fall also im an hour from the nearest beach and no lake or river near me has shown up as a water biome lake gregory and lake arrowhead do but im not fond of mountain driving
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,which im not sure i believe if you are from socal i assume ie means inland empire in which case he would be quite far from the biomes where bubblestrat pokemon are prevalent that said id still make a trip to at least just grab some magikarp over this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it didnt i was misremembering the magikarps dropped horsea became hp still but kills my lvl diglett wbubble as well as the next pokemon too pikachu meowth and others require revives too making it worse than magikarping now as each round often costs two revives i have magnemites for magikarping but they became and respectively too high for the horsea and for the magikarp the best ive found is pikachu on a karp which now gets two fights per pot instead of four
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds pretty viable id been considering the same for a while but never bothered to attempt it in any case youve definitely thought this through well so kudos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah thats definitely more important but any moveset gyarados is worth maxing out eventually especially since they have to add tms or some equivalent to change movesets eventually this is why i have so many particular mon that i dont use at all such as vileplume and rhydon where i have a few high iv with crap moves and some slightly lower iv with the moves i need but i wont upgrade any of them yet id hate to upgrade a lower iv one just to be able to change the move set later and not have upgraded the higher iv also gyarados is only really useful for topping any random gym its cp does it more utility than any other feature it has or for adding variety to a carefully built level gym to force an attacker team to bring an electric type along somewhat weakening their total dps capability of their team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,another benefit to furystrat is that it does not require strict ivs one of my oldest defenders is ivs with attack but due to being lvl it makes little difference i still have attackers that can stand up to it for max prestige every time every potion i get means xp and prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in bubblestrat if attacker dies but still manage to win the battle then his hp actually revives so see if you actually need a revive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,correct ive been fortunate enough to buddy my way to a twister gyarados but since pogos launch ive only been able to make one trip to the coast i can safety say that i will not be visiting balboa peir for pokemon again i actually had one of the magikarp i found there run away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still use my diglets i have an army of them against a karp diglet gets two fights before needing a potion i can get three victories with him if i want to use a revive and a potion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,horsea became hp still i use bellsprout w vine whip and he works my digletts dont any more same as yours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get maybe its the stamina thats screwing it up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how can you find iv without trainers level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,from what ive seen metal coat and up grade are more common that of course isnt a true statistical analysis
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,from how i understand it the ones that are used for multiple pokemon are more common but after that its jsut rng i had metal coats but only upgrade
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,apparently the ones that can be used on two pokemon are slightly more common though i cant find the source for this now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looking at the replies i get the feeling that it has something to do with the area were in up to now i got dragon scale kings rock and only one of the others
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the screenshot is all of my evo items to date prior to the seven days streak i had one sun stone and upgrades
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kings rock dragon scales and upgrade probably just rng
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wonder the same thing however our results are certainly very different i have received upgrade kings rocks and sunstones i have saved up all the mons and candy needed to evolve several scythers onix and seadras but have not received any of the necessary metal coats or dragons scales
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive gotten metal coats and one kings rock im not liking those odds
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so far ive got sun stones kings rocks metal coats dragon scales upgrades
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for me metal coats and upgrades are very rare so far ive got of each however i have kingra and unused dragon scales
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so far ive received sun stones kings rocks metal coats dragon scales upgrade
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes in other words those in this thread saying the ones used in more evolutions were more common are correct this is probably the research post they were thinking of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,havent got a single metal coat yet and have a perfect scyther and a onyx got kings rock sun stone upgrades and dragon scale
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got coats upgrades sunstones dragon scales and kings rocks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that would make sense theres a comment about location coming into play that kind of makes sense as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats actually a pretty interesting tale on it makes sense but i never thought of that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so far ive got sun stones kings rocks metal coats dragon scale upgrades and that is in a very magnemite dense area onix and scyther ive seen quite regularly as well all those coats though they are the only ones i really dont need all other evolution items except upgrades are for dirt common pokemons of which theres actually a chance of finding nice specimens to evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,four times zero is still zero the nearest pikachu nests are over an hour away from my house i wasnt invited to this pika party
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wont hold my breath other than the holiday event ive seen one pikachu since july in my area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,go visit your local pikachu nest some of us live in cities that still dont have pikachu nests you could have ended at biome dependent lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and if you dont have a local pikachu nest hmmm lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no event for many of us its stupid to make it biome dependent i dont understand these decisions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in a biome that regularly spawns pikachu a day every day and i havent seen a single one since the event went live
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive had the opposite i usually see or so pikachus a day and since the event havent seen a single one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmmm so i go from seeing no pikachu in hours to seeing no pikachu in hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,jesus people are salty that you said visit your local pikachu nest like damn guys its not ops fault you dont live in the citylive near a pika nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting i never see pikachu and havent seen any wild got this morning on a lure i placed none anywhere not even on trackers all day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes this is my situation as well id estimate that there was always about a chance of seeing a pikachu where i live so times that is essentially zero meaning i wont see one this week thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not much of a party anyway youre not missing anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not all cities have pikachu nests
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,idgaf i said i used a tracker in my city and i said it was biome dependent my science is biased thats anecdotal yikes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yall are trolling me lately or i really dont understand the arbitrary line this community draws between salty humor and disgust
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i understand that just making a point that people are directing complaints at op for some reason
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because his title seems to claim that it is up everywhere he could have ended with in my city for clarification
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,he is still correct with the increase if you see generally you will still see during the event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly some people will get upset at anything ive given up trying to appease everyone because youll always get some whiners
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,he may be right but his title is still going to piss people off regardless even if it is not warranted so far a day is my normal rate and its been holding even after the increase
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught one pikachu outside the xmas event i was on holiday in spain for that as well im as miffed about this increase as anyone just dont see why op is getting all the hate for reporting his findings
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have upgrades racked up too and ive yet to catch a porygon such is life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same thing metal coats but still no upgrade
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive got of them for seadra
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you get a metal coat your odds of your next item being a metal coat are the same as getting an upgrade or a sun stone in fact for each evolution item you get the odds of getting a duplicate go up if you have an upgrade a sunstone and a kings rock youre more likely to get one of those than you are to get one you dont have
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,about the same as having four different evolutionary items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have over porygon candy and still need an upgrade
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have upgrades and no other items i know im beginning to think the place i hunt only give upgrades
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats a really interesting theory do you have any evidence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not a statistician so correct me if im wrong but getting four different evolutionary items is easier than getting upgrades in a row lets assume each evolutionary item has the same probability and lets call it to obtain upgrades the probability would be p to obtain different evolutionary items it would be p the reasoning is because we have chance of obtaining any evolutionary item after that we have chance of obtaining the remaining evolution items then we have chance of obtaining the remaining items then it would be chance to obtain the last item tldr i have no idea what im doing but i think getting four different evolutionary items is easier than upgrades
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its math when you have over half the items the odds of getting a different one are lower than the odds of getting one you already have
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the odds are the same if you also predict which youre getting so if you say what are the odds ill get an upgrade a kings rock a sun stone and a dragon scale thats the same as what are the odds ill get upgrade assuming each is equally likely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh sorry i misunderstood your comment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive evolved or caught twenty three clefable only gotten one with poundmoonblast twentythree
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wghp blastoise is ruining the game for me blastoise and counting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyarados without twister magikarp are uncommon around me but ive managed to get six gyarados so far all with twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blastoise still no water gunhydro pump rhydon still no mud slap with either earthquake or stone edge alakazam no psycho cutpsychic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wiggly with pound hyper beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vwpb or sb venusaur ive evolved all iv and i just cant get a good moveset im not exactly swimming in bulbasaur candy so itll be a while until i can try again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax with zhbs i know i have high standards
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im actually in the same boat as you with the sb exeggutor granted i havent evolved one in awhile as i havent found a high leveliv one in awhile but once i do i have candy queued up to roll the dice others of course would be like wafb charizard but ive only had one chance at that ended up with eft
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wghp blastoise pjeq nidoking pcpsy alakazam kccc machamp wghp omastar msse kabutops vwsb venasuar wafb charizard i want best movesets for anything just in case mainly attack but cant seem to find these yes some are low but candies are harder to find so it feels like forever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a raichu with thunderive gotten of them all with brick break
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,six seadras and none with hydropump and four pidgeots none with hurricane
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,water gun hydropump blastoise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cant get a mud slapearthquake rhydon for the life of me other than that ive got all the best attack or defense movesets for my pokémon although some have crappy ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i posted a few days ago that i could not get a rhydon with either msse or mseq after tries it is now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent been able to get a dragon breath dragonite all my got steel wing i cant get physco cut on alakazam and also i wouldnt mind a better pound mb clefable i do have one with bad ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont have a single pokemon with stone edge nidoqueen always ends up with earthquake hitmonlee with low sweep onix with rock slide rhydon with megahorn golem with ancient power kabutops with ancient power dugtrio with mud bomb and machamp with submission i cant even get a graveler with stone edge also on fbb cloyster on isib lapras on wafb charizard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vwsb venusaur of kccc machamp of psychic exeggutor of notable mentions cloyster fbb out of rhydon mseq out of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,water gunhydro pump omastar just cant get it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mother fuckin bubble hydro pump on a poliwrath evolved about already and got with bubble ice punch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fire type moves on a rapidash psycho cut for alakazam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poliwraths no bubblehydropump
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,water gun hydro pump blastoise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got wghp blastoise bhp garados vwpb and vwsb venusaur and the third alakazam got pcp still no mseq on rhydon and sandslash though hey even trainertips nick finally managed to get one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im still searching for these and it is really the only goal i have left in the game level lapras ice shard ice beam venasaur vine whip solar beam muk poison jab sludge wave or gunk shot gyarados bite hydro pump blastoise water gun hydro pump
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have evolved poliwraths all the worst moveset the worst
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,most significant would be a raichu with thunder a nidoqueen with earthquake or an exeggutor with solarbeam most failed attempts definitely parasect with fcslb prob failures incl a iv also stuff like beedrill fearow and tentacruel nailed gyarados alakazam and charizard first try so cant really complain
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for here stuck in a gym and it hasnt returned for days i hope hes okay
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,clefable all with dazzling gleam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty extreme bad luck especially given the probability of rolling the move dice identically times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on ill catch up im sure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol im level and ive only made it to candies so far ill take any gyarados
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got gyarados and they all have different charge moves the collector in me loves it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dude sorry i hate this aspect of the game i got pcp on my evo jeez bad design
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have one just caught it wild a few days ago cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i want ppr but cant get that or phb after tries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have venusaur only one has vine whip and he got sludge bomb i have bulbasaur candies with a good iv one to evolve but ive given up on getting vwsb or pb
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got one with iv and wild now d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got a sb eggy on my try cant get confusionpsychic tho just seed bomb after seed bomb and the damn thing are pretty uncommon where im at caught a high iv exeggute a couple weeks back and am less than candies from another try
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same with me for the seadras i had to double check to see if it was still a possible charge move
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good luck with the pidgeot i know how hard pidgey can be to come across
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i finally got the rhydon today still cant get wigglytuff with poundhb though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,might catch people off guard with the ice punch having run into a few it actually does change the battle a bit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats what my vw venusaur has too im jealous of how many candy you have
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,very nice i got tired of waiting and powered my iv zhhb to that once i blew those candies i would for sure get the zhbs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dude nice iv zhbs ran from me the other day one of only two snorlax to flee still so full of sodium about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im hoping they come of use when kingdra is released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me on the other hand have found wild seadra with wghp high ivs and were cp prior to rebalance helps living in a water biome but shrugs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hope youre not being too picky with the jigglys ivs wigglytuff only viable as prestiger
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thought of this as well especially since players often use dragonite as their main attackers i just wish they gave poliwrath a cp buff
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im a candy hoarderespecially when i keep getting disappointed with movesets i have over candies for several mons bellsprout oddish bulbasaur poliwag exeggs zubats and both nidorans and i have eevee candies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i lost a dragonite last nightlow iv but still feel your pain
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wouldnt seadra with dragon breath and either blizzarddragon pulse be of nice use to prestige against dragonite obviously there are several better options to those that have them available but in a pinch it would work pretty well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh im always picky with ivs but at this stage anything above would do ive evolved about a dozen best so far is with poundplay rough which is fine too but id really like a hb one too to complete the collection all the high iv ones have had dazzling gleam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poliwrath is such a badass too darn shame
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont use a lot of my candy so i have of a lot too heres hoping the next cp rebalance is a doozy lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ooooooooof that would have been a plugnplay defender for you sorry about that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think it would have been better this is torture
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting topic for discussion in hindsight if they had had the game ready for release when they first announced it it would have obviously been a massive success the hype was unreal the go trailer is the most watched video on the pokemon youtube channel almost million views compared to million views for the sun and moon announcement video and every single pokemonrelated media outlet and forum was exploding with hype now after this prolonged beta the hype has mostly died everywhere except in these dedicated reddit subs in other pokemon communities im following the reaction to all new information has been at best indifferent shrugs at worst immense disappointment it doesnt seem likely that the hype from the initial announcement can be recaptured at this point but i could be wrong on the other hand the expectations from the original trailer which kinda gave the false impression that the game would include all the features people love from the actual games was way too high for the product well apparently be getting if the game was launched right after that most people would have been immensely disappointed and probably uninstalled it pretty fast now people have had lots of time to see that its not going to be a game that brings the original pokemon experience to real life and so more people might be able to just enjoy it for what it is of course not everyone is following the beta news so there will still be backlash from people who only saw the original trailer but probably less than if they had the game ready to go without all this waiting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think if they did this i would be more satisfied as a user with the dribbling info playing favorites with ingress players and all around lack of engagement with customers i will be giving them in the app store when it comes out and i encourage more to do so i do not do this out of spite but solely on how they offer no explanation of their actions and offer no communication to those they leave in the dark in this age with this large excited fan base to not offer development progress and explain the reason for betas tests sizes is inexcusable i work for a tech company and if i did not communicate to my customers i would have no customers sorry for the rant been sitting on these thoughts for months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,s what im saying man making me even wonder if the hype was done on purpose
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,welcome to obsessive game development watching i have been in this boat with star citizen for years it hurts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting indeed it may even end up with an entirely fresh player base i remembered telling my friends about ingress at first it was thought ridiculous to waste time walking around the place now theyve all formed a community and are even more active than me that being said i would be very surprised if as a well crafted game it doesnt explode beyond expectations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow youre from guyana i was starting thinking that was south americas wyoming which we all know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,from a business prospective it was genius unless somehow the game disappoints although i highly doubt it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but anyone can play sc if they buy the starter pack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true it does have untapped potential in the casual mobile gamer market outside the pokemon fandom since they wont have the same memories and expectations hindering their enjoyment i do hope they expand the portalpokesopgym availability before launch though its very limited in places where ingress wasnt popular before they closed the portal submission for example in my country only the largest few cities have a decent density of portals the rest of the country only has per town as far as ive seen basically as things are now theyre heavily limiting the expansion of pogo to certain parts of the world since the availability of pokestops and gyms is so crucial to the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lmao so think most website developers who give any ip from latin america a full spanish page yes man we very much exist snugly between our spanish portuguese and dutch neighbours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true but all the new builds and new stuff then going to ptu and getting the invite lottery for that every time but i dont have that problem anymore fortunately
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in order to place a pokémon at a gym you must be on the team corresponding to the color of the gym you must have an available pokémon with full health you must have not already placed a pokémon at that specific gym the gym must have a high enough prestige level that it has an available slot for a pokémon is the prestige points it shows that you need to add prestige to get to the next level the gym could still be full i believe a gym at that prestige is level and has a max of pokémon and if they have exactly prestige there are most likely already three pokémon there since you get each time to drop the next defending pokémon off you would need to train the gym prestige up to first to get it to level you would then be able to drop off a fourth pokémon there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you must have not already placed a pokémon at that specific gym so each player can only place one pokémon in each gym kinda figured itd be a bit like ingress portals where you can place as much resonators as you want within available slots and fellow team trainers would be able to replace them with their highier leveled pokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no that isnt the system now a beta tester confirmed to me on another thread that there is no replacement possible or reordering of the pokemon right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,each player can only put a maximum of one pokemon at a gym it says this on the official pokemoncom site for go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you think about it it is like ingress portals sure you can place resonators on a single portal but you can only place that actually matters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so the pokémon stay in the gym until a trainer from an opposing team makes it faint fair enough i think thats a bit more fair to lower leveled players edit coming to think of it they stay in the gym until another team takes it right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,more right on the edit but not completely the whole team needs to be beaten for the gym to lose prestige after being beaten a few several times the gym will lose all its prestige and the pokemon will go back and the gym will be neutral im stating all this from memory of stuff i read here id love a beta tester or someone else to confirm if what i said is all true
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when a gym gets defeated it loses prestige once the prestige has dropped enough the lowest cp pokemon in it is fainted and sent back to their trainer that means it is totally reasonable although unlikely in most cases that a gym could be beaten several times but not actually cleared completely allowing it to be trained back up and stocked with different pokemon its also worth noting that the order is weakest to strongest every time it doesnt matter the order theyre put in at all other than to maybe change the starting strength of a gym im not actually sure on that count tbh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was under the impression that each individual pokemon that was defeated lost some prestige unless thats changed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for offering your help im adding the names of those whore volunteering in this thread to our list well be reaching out to you fine travelers in the next week or two about the translation effort nbsp except ubendyrulz sorry im sure you have other talents

TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can assist with portuguese as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can help with brazilian portuguese too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no considering your flair you can translate it to brasilian you have loads of different words and meanings so theres that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you guys are creating a mess for nothing nobody from portugal offered to help having the website translated to brazilian portuguese is better than no portuguese at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,add me onto spanish just in case did someone say portuguese along the way ctrlf yup found some
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i could help with german too if still needed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,please yes reading dutch and listening to native speakers is the second best thing when visiting amsterdam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is no such thing the language is still the same that is why multiple translators from preferably different countries of the same language are the best for optimal results i also volunteer to help if need be
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no considering you dont know what youre talking about i cant translate it to portuguese theres no such thing as brasilian if someone from portugal or some country from africa wants to translate to portuguese too then we can make distinctions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont want to start anything but brazilian portuguese is not the same as portugal portuguese it is the same root language and one of those languages that are similar but there are some differences that can cause confusion overall if its in braz port or port port it wont make a difference to the reader
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont understand what im saying what i mean is i am tired of seeing websites or applications saying translate to portuguese with a portuguese flag on it and when you click it everything is in brasilian its annoying cause its not the same bloody thing same with all african countries whose language roots come for portugal loads of them come from france too and you never see a translate to french with an african flag under it do you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree but to avoid using expressions that arent common to both countries i suggested the idea above
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres no such thing as brasilian if you want so much you can call it brazilian portuguese ptbr
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haa see theres the difference its brasilian in portuguese not brazilian
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hope they dont instantly ban everybody with two accounts just the ones who use them for things like you said in july when the servers were still having trouble i linked my google account since i heard it logged into google more easily than the ptc ever since then i havent gone back to that account but im worried they might somehow find it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is he using devices or the same one if it is devices i dont see what can be done about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have this same guy in my town i wish there was some way to expose them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can report them but theres no guarantee theyll be banned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have two different accounts too but thats because when i first joined i was in the minority group and didnt have fun since there was only two other players so i switched to another team and ditched the other account for good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill post a pic of them if you want to maybe if enough players report them theyll get banned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,devilishchild please get off the internet you edgy old
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looking at your responses in this thread you are just an angry person good luck with that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this dps analysis takes all those factors into account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,which is funny because i had a pidgey with twister i should have kept it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was fury cutter the only attack that had its energy generation changed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a very short test of this yesterday i used my favorite jolteon twice in a gym that was stacked with water types and he definitely seemed to get in more attacks than before i only used him times but it seemed like he was definitely faster id like to try with him again and really focus on the differences
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no one has been banned for taking screenshots friend only for leaking them on the internet so be careful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you for the quick response
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cried then i realized my battery life would be the same tomorrow and felt better one day i shall be able to kill my battery to try to be the best like no one ever was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i finally accepted that i wouldnt get in this morning after checking and rechecking my spam folder one last time at least the other guy in my office that wanted it didnt get in either that would be salt in the wound
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well you should feel a bit better im from pakistan and have no idea when ill be ever able to play go feel better now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cri
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my salt levels
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah but think about it we wont have to say good bye to all our pokemon and hard work when the data wipe comes before launch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,any hope i had left in life drained to zero i spent months getting to level in ingress solely for pokemon go i wasted all that time my life is over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol john hanke hates u
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lvl ingress player here i knew i should have taken this more seriously
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,both here and crying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea dont want to crash the servers before their launch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they should honestly give to everyone so then we can all help since were all pokemon fans
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree give it to all who signed up what would be the best way to view data that players submit the more the merrier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same feelings from me here in africa
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whos this john hanke i only know hank johnson p after that meme floating around here if he wants me to call him by his real name ever again he can just send me a beta invite pls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lvl playing since closed beta with a year hiatus due to the newborn took it seriously still didnt get invited cest la vie
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wish i could agree with you but i would not want to be the server techdata analyst that has to deal with the fallout from that many people on a platform that isnt ready for a deployment of that scale theyll give it to all the people that signed up and more when theyre ready and the game is more stable theyll call it launch i didnt get in but from my pals that did it is definitely not ready for mass deployment yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ever thought about the people analyzing the data
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ingress i have never played it actually so no idea but i believe it is playable actually im just waiting for pgo global beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,john hanke is one of the core people behind ingress and is a person that many people feel fond of he was one of those players who was also a character not in the paid way like klue or moyer but in the sense that he seemed to really manifest the storyline in his personality and actions he unexpectedly died about months ago from a heart attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dang thats rough then again you already have a builtin teammate p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,john hanke didnt die do you mean joe philley
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh yeah hes almost now and ill occasionally throw the anime on the tv for him he always loves it cant wait until hes old enough to start playing the games with me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah damnit i retract my statement pretend you never saw a thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you just killed off john hanke in your mind now youre definitely not getting a beta invite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,too late d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the belief existed before maybe this is why you didnt get the invite p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh i mean too late for you i got invited
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,time to kill you off in my mind in some tragic way maybe that gyarados that your were so oblivious to bites your head off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not really useful but my daugthers spent a lot of time yesterday creating different mix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ingress was released publicly the day the closed beta ended im hoping that happens here too but its not official
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the guy who created it was just a troll he was banned from the pokemon go united states facebook page for intentionally trying to mislead people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did they announce it or did it just show up in the app store
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nothing confirmed yet but there will be official new info about sunmoon on friday so ive been obsessively checking back here for any leaks about anything at all though it may not be likely that pokemongo is mentioned at all during that event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,were thinking july
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fourth of july weekend would be the perfect launch weekend in the states we can only hope it goes off for hours then boom its live
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ingress only changed from closed into open beta and then from closed beta into released seamlessly with both the open and the closed beta running for a much longer time than the pokemon go field tests
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did they tell the public they were going to fo that before hand or it just happened with no warning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also ingress was only niantic there are a couple other little companies involved with this release
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did niantic say that they were going to do this with ingress did the beta testers have any idea that this would happen i assume that ninatic will handle gos launch a little bit differently since pokémon is a worldwide phenomenon and has the potential to triple ingresss player base
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would even line up with the weekend of the national championship it would crossproduct coordinate so nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and wont happen beta testers will get a screen that has already been leaked saying well be back soon i doubt soon will mean its here already
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it just showed up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,some nonamerican down voted you but ill give it back for fireworks pun and i also want this game asap xx
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats more or less what i meant it went public as in public beta i highly doubt well see a public beta and then a full release theyll probably jump to a full release i just know how they handled ingress if its not out on the then i wont be shocked in fact ill be more surprised if it is out i do know that niantic has been cranking out updates very quickly during these last few weeks of the field test i think the release well see is just the final patch on the field test
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,guessing there was no wipe with ingress then so since we know there will be a wipe in pokemon go im pretty sure the servers will at least go down at some point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we knew ahead of time also ingress beta went on for over a year and went from closed beta to open beta and took a long time each time to go through each step also no data was wiped
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah im not holding my breath i just know that was how they did ingress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you dont ever see many then evolve it no since in waiting months for something better finish the pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why wouldnt you evolve it though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really recommend not evolving it this is what i am doing and i recommend you do as well set blissey as your buddy and start walking him he will be your buddy for a good long time the goal is going to be to build up enough candy to evolve one and power it up to your desired level for me im level so i need about candy to evolve one and max it out i have one thats around candy but why would i evolve it when my next could bring something better i will walk out another candy then pick whatever is best at that point this is a strategy i use with many pokémon by the way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poke genie
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what app are you using to get the ivs here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so i dont get many chanseys where i live in fact ive only ever seen and have been playing since day ive finally gotten enough candies from walking to evolve this one and wondering if i should evolve it or wait and pray for a better one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait youll get a better one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokemongoivs is a better sub for this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so i dont get many chanseys where i live in fact ive only ever seen and have been playing since day ive finally gotten enough candies from walking to evolve this one and wondering if i should evolve it or wait and pray for a better one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agree youll get a better one eventually in the meantime you can evolve this one walk it up and farm the coins youll need to buy the incubators to finally hatch the better one but then im less a stickler for ivs even for defenders i cut off at but made an exception for my blissey neé chansey only in the very most competitive gym scenes will the difference between and matter thats much for gym placement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does anyone know what app is being used in the image to calculate the ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caughthatched total and have one with and one with i had a run from me but a friend captured her so ive encountered three highiv seen that im aware of since in a chansey rich area evolve and power her up imo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah they do attack iv really matters for cp id rather have a than a
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokie genie for ios
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah my blissey wont crack cp because its attack is while my chansey with a attack would if i evolved it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not a popular opinion here but yes fans of dodging everything have been asking for this data for a while and not much has come out about this thats in part due to how complicated it gets there is no generic ranking anymore when you need to consider exactly which move versus which other move some sheets do allow for this type of calculation though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes this has previously been discussed it has been discussed to the point that the gamepress move data now includes separate defensive dps to show exactly what youre talking about fast attacks will also generally result in higher energy gain which is why youll sometimes see a lower dps move considered to be optimal it will give better dodge opportunities and higher energy gain in most cases
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i find charge bar attacks really bad for defenders or more is fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,though honestly i believe with this new system the only thing that matters is getting a defender with as high cp as possible since your worst opponent seems to be your own teammates but hey it could change someday better be prepared
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the issue is that you simulated battles against all pokemon rather than against pokemon that are likely to be used my rankings weight attackers by probability of use see
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really have to disagree with the inclusion of arcanine here and i think that directly says something bad about the methodology used like hes good but only because hes highcp and thus gets knocked out later than something actually effective like a poliwrath but using a fire type for defence is insane in this game because everyone has vaporeons available to attack you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish i saw more arcanine nidokingnidoqueen in gyms they melt like butter to any vaperion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this list mostly matches my experience of the difficulty of beating defenders only nuances would be what are considered the best charge moves eg definitely prefer to face a hyper beam snorlax than a body slam snorlax the first is trivial to dodge the second really quite difficult
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish poliwrath would float up a gym like an arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,arcanine is higher than vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,raw cp matters a lot more in the current meta getting high up in those level gyms is way more important than how tough what you put in actually is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well the part with only dodging charge moves skews the defenders with long hardhitting moves like those with bubbleconfusion i myself find it easy to dodge against slow moves you can fit water guns per confusion yet i dont find it as rewarding to dodge the watergun vaporeon this list is a good scenario for defending against people who just spam through gyms which i do when i have excess resources
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,add max cp at level to that list and i think itd be more informative most gyms have no space for under cp and some have no space for under cp hard to put a polywrath or slowbro in such a gym on the other hand i dont put arcanine in gyms anymore they are just to easy to beat in my area eevee and thus vaporeon is more common here than most any pokemon enough so i evolve about for every lucky egg i use those sessions have evolves it doesnt help that i get eevee in of my eggs on top of the wild caught
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id like to see this list weighted by attacker rarity
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you have readily available what the list would look like if werent a ranking of species where a species is limited to one spot on the list would say anything below exeggutor or slowbrow even make it into the top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can someone explain why poliwrath is good i have battled him in gym and he was actually super easy to take down with that move set bubble seems to have such a slow attack time that anyone could dodge it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was under the impression that the best defense move set for lapras was ice shardice beam am i wrong
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so vape with aqua tail is better than vape with water pulse right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice but quite misleading as this does not take into account some obvious facts just to list a few people will use type advantage very often especially against dragonite and arcanine almost everybody has a few good stab water types which makes rhydon and golem a joke as defenders vileplume ranked what good is his solar beam when any decent arcanine will burn the vileplume to the ground before it even fires the solar beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont agree with solar beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just hatched a lapras last night it has ice shard and dragon pulse ive gotten mixed opinions on upgrading it anyone have thoughts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,except in the real world arcanine nidoqueen rhydon golem and nidoking get totally shredded by vaporeon never use them as a gym defender as literally everyone has a high cp counter ready and waiting to ko them things like exeggutor snorlax lapras and i guess even vaporeon with less easily abused typing are much better defenders while these pokemon have counters they are tough to take advantage of or they otherwise has such high stats that they can do decent damage regardless
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,typing not taken into account so yeah pretty useless unless you assume that your opponent picks their attackers randomly lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this must average some data from all the fights right because some kind of average defensiveness against all attackers is the only way i can see a few of these up on the list because golem is double weak to water which really hurts his defensive capabilities anything weak to water actually makes a paper defender anyway arcanine is awesome for attacking but a joke for defending too many good wghp users in the game that are too easy to get
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,any list that has dragonite as the thirdbest defender is inherently flawed sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have to say this is the worst defensive moveset ranking list ive ever seen i have a exeggutor with confusionpsychic and he hits like a freakin truck solar beam is soooooo easily dodged psychic not as much same thing with zhhb snorlax its my opinion that zhbs is better because its so unpredictable and because ive also heard one zh is enough to charge bslol vaporeon again wgwp is the best defensive moveset arcanine is terrible at defending due to op water pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,could you tell us your methods i dont think people are just going to take your word for this without explaining your methods also the numbers are completely arbitrary without knowing your methods
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is handy does anyone have any apps that act as an overlay or something that can help while in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this list is junk its all about dragonite and power level the highest cp doesnt get kick out the best way for niantic to fix this highest cp is to make it random defender kick when a defending team loses enough prestige it randomly kick one defending pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah not sure how hyperbeam can be better on defence than body slam it is so easy to dodge i dont think i ever failed it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,very much so not only are they easier dodge but also in the case of exeggutor for example if youre using super effective bug or even fire attacks you can finish it off before it can hit you with solar beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do charge moves tale their full duration as a defender
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its written in description dodge only on charges in this way its obvious one charge is better many ppl play like that so it even got some point anyway thanks for your job op
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree solar beam sometimes throws me off but i dodge it most of the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly right now i just place my highest cp pokemon so they dont get kicked out quickly they better change the cp formula and give the speed status actual importance or we are going to see the same pokemon every time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah poliwraths lose value daily because of their low cp cap all bout that cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah many on the list are disqualified as defenders simply because their cp is too low but thats depending on your local competition each can judge by themselves where that limit it is for them at least the top should remain more or less the same because a gym cant really become so full of dragonites that you kick out all the snorlax and lapras if that happens the gym is not going to stand too long since anyone with lapras passing by can wreck it relatively quickly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i typically pick my defender with a cp so it sits just above one or a few of the big three of snorlax draginite or lapras then there is a deterrent to trying unless the attacker wants to take down the whole gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,totally agree it doesnt matter how strong the defender is at least lowest defenders will be knocked down everyday then someone will leveling the gym again so all you should do is try to stay around top of the gym and you will be safe for a while

TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did that but it varies by zone the ranking for my zone is useless to most users here the first spots dont change that much though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the game has moved on from everyone has vaporeons to everyone has decent counters to just about everything everything but the few that dont have much in the way of decent counters lapras snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,where i live there are tons of plant types that kill vapes super easily putting vapes in gyms is stupid except they are high cp and easy to get so they are everywhere shrugs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well this is not metagame based this was made considering every possible pokemon species and moveset without giving more relevance to any one of them i agree one should make his own ranking based on his zone the page that made it has an option for a metagame based ranking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,everyone has vaporeons in your area i live in a growlithe and mankey infested area up to the last lucky egg run my counter for arcanine was a sandslash mud shot earthquake or a bite flamethrower arcanine in the last lucky egg two days ago i finally got my first vaporeon though with pulse and got a sandslash with mud shot earthquake everyone here has arcanines while counters are not as easy to find as there are no water spawns anywhere near sometimes a goldeen or krabby will spawn all my water pokemon which arent that many are from when i drive to a different city to visit my grandma
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have to understand that there are pokemon in the gym and many attackers will have pokes knocked out or weakened or have to switch out and save that poke for later in order to get through an entire gym if they want to be efficient and fast if they got all the time in the world then they can go ahead and use vaporeaon army or whatever other noob tactics that wont help them become better battlers the people battling for speed effiecientcy matchups and tactics will always be the better battlers short term and long term for when metta changes they will have a better poke variety and arsenal as well for when quests come out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you probably see the ones above arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a perfect poisonearthquake nidoking that i would love to power up and use in gyms but due to its low cp compared to vapelapsnorlaxetc and how rampant vapes are it stands no chance to stay long as a defender
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,funnily enough i have a really easy time dodging body slams but always seem to get nailed by hyper beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,their score is almost equal i find both of them equally easy to defeat to be honest grass and water pokemon are too common apart from poliwrath the first spots are hard to beat imo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this only applies if there are high level gyms which do not change hands often in your area i have watched the gyms near me change from red to yellow to blue and back to red in less than an hour here it is a war of attrition in my area so picking defenders which will deplete your opponents time and resources are the highest priorities
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my zone is usually enough to get a good spot on a gym people here also dont have that many vaporeons since venusaur exeggcutor and other grass types are too common seriously im getting tired of catching bulbasaurs the list wasnt made based on my zone though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on the other hand i dont put arcanine in gyms anymore i dont either retain one of mine for taking out exeggutors and lapras the other is trapped in a glitched gym that always errors out for both attackers and prestigers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just go in pokegorankcom and select antimeta ranking or something like that you can choose the attackers youre interested in there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how would that work rarity depends on where you live
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just poliwrath and slowbro didnt even make it ended up at spot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes that baffles me as well and the entire reason for bubblestrat working is that the defender has bubble and is fainted before it can get bubble to hit httpspokemongogamepressggbubblestrat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good attackers can dodge every move easily at this point and take defenders down pretty quickly defenders spam quick attacks at the beginning of a fight so having a damage quick move with stab hurts i dont know why hydro pump is considered his best move as i think ice punch has a pretty good place in the meta since its doubly effective against the best attacker in the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yah i disagree from my experience id prefer facing an aqua tail over water pulse outta times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anything below the place is bad actually its a that doesnt mean all are equally good neither similarly good its just a reference chart one should always adjust to its own zone and catchable pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragon pulse is as good as any other charge move for defense ice moves will get resisted by attacker anyway so the damage will be only magneton resists both types and will take less damage from dragon move on the other hand attacking lapras would take more damage since he double resists ice tldr lapras with ice shard is a great defender regardless of charge move power him up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre not likely to get another lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its worth powering up to put in gyms not only do you want high cp anyway for defenders but a big lapras is one of the only two actual deterrents to someone attacking the gym they wont know it has dragon pulse until theyre fought it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,totally agree though no defender is invincible i think how good a defender is determined for how high the cp of the attackers needed to defeat it is since it determines teh prestige loss also the time potionsrevives needed to defeat it high cp counters are bad in my opinion low cp counters take much more prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive done rankings that take into account type
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah its an average and i agree on that curious enough vaporeon is everywhere though grass attackers are quite easy to obtain and defeat vaporeon easily
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,again it all depends on your zone playstyle and other people playstyle on your zone theres no such thing as an absolute ranking that applies for everybody i guess but people seem to believe in datasheets i dont see why simulated battles should be less trustworthy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its based on simulated battles againt all other pokemon just evolved the numbers are just a measure of how good they did on those battles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my xperia have an overlay internet browser very handy not sure if there is one for other phones but all xperia have it i think
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how in the world does this help ok they beat up on your vaporeon and the dragonite got kicked out yay youre still in except theyre just gonna keep beating up on your cp until everything gets kicked out anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in a decent ranking of effectiveness as a defender dragonite doesnt crack the top five as for your suggestion random is a terrible and lazy idea there are plenty of better suggestions that have been repeated ad nauseam in the many many many gym stagnation threads that litter this sub already
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the table is quite misleading imho and can seriously confuse new players it takes no consideration of the current meta and the fact that almost exclusively people use stab attackers against a vulnerable defender and all experienced players dodge easily stuff like hyperbeam earthquake blizzard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i agree with this my mindset about gym defender is as long as not bar charge move its good for defend gym to dodge bar move is a piece of cake imo the hardest move to dodge is dragon claw dragon pulse and body slam respectively
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its highly subjective though to try to rank every pokemon based on how difficult you perceive each and every attack is to dodge if op would do like that there would have been if you can dodge both well for example hyper beam again becomes the better move so i can see why op chose to do it this way using all attackers is also an objective way to evaluate them its not perfect but neither is a global estimation of the meta perhaps ranking each by performance against their best counter would have been better but its not completely objective either since have counters more rare than others and are unlikely to be pitted against that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think there is an exception if the fast attack is very powerful and stab bubble confusion and the short charge attacks arent that good submission bubblehydro pump poliwrath i actually think is the best poliwrath against a prepared opponent a proper counter to bubbleice punch poliwrath makes ice punch pretty bad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and you resist solar beam which negates stab psychic is definitely more effective and very unlikely to be resisted by the attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,coming up on months and it hasnt changed same defenders everywhere hard to expect a change when its been an unchanged problem the whole time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as time progresses more and more people will get dragonites in months itll be gyms with nothing but dragonites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,somebody kicked my poliwrath out of a level gym so they could stick in a vaporeoni am starting to get really angry with multiaccount scumbags
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,species or cp makes very little difference to whether it can be defeated but the higher the cp the less likely it is to get knocked out because pokemon are knocked out from the lowest cp up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,imho they will change a lot dragonite will be massively overrated slowbro dewgong hypno massively underrated arcanine should definitely not be in the top its terrible against vaporeon which is what it will be facing of the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,everything has counters but if your counter is one of the big you have a real problem vaporeon is objectively good and a very popular candidate to pump full of stardust any time i see an arcanine defender i am thrilled
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use a primape on snorelaxs highest ive gotten to fight so far was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,parasect with bug bite solar beam is my go to vape killer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would say the same of any monotype with a hard counter vape is a dismal gym defender because water gun is lousy on defence and its trivially easy to counter and the same is true of arcanine only more so because it doesnt have the hp and when attacking water gun is outrageously good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive done something like this taking type into account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and what is the url of that page
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if only trading were a thing already httpiimgurcomwwioqrpjpg until a nest popped up somewhat nearby i only had a single arcanine thanks to an egg and the buddy system
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a nidoking that earned a battles won somehow so they do find themselves being useful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think you deserve the downvotes different people can have different experiences
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here i suspect it might have to do with whether youre trying to dodge everything if youre only dodging charge moves hyper beam is obvious from a mile away whereas body slam comes out of nowhere on the other hand if you try to dodge everything dodging body slam feels a lot more in rhythm for me its like dodging another quick move whereas hyper beam messes up the rhythm even though you see it coming a mile away that might account for some of the difference also semirelated it gets me that hyper beam has such a long prelude that you get really tempted to squeeze a few more quick attacks in and then you mess up and your mon instantdies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vaporeon has almost the stamina though so its going to take more time to take one down and time to kill is really the best defensive metric imho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still just have my starter bulbasaur have walked him to near candy everybody is jealous of everybody else haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks i didnt know about that tool yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so just to clarify exeggutor doesnt make the list either poliwrath is above exeggutor on the list in the post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the responses guys i had these thoughts as well took me months to hatch this guyso im not sure how much patience i have to sit on candies waiting for another one looks like ill ignore the advice of the naysayers in my city telling me to wait
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,quantums rankings was much better then this the fact that the ops list has arcanine as a good defender in a meta full of vaporeons indicates it is detached from reality not to mention all the bar moves just no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the problem is that grass attackers are almost always dual type and therefore its harder to get them with the correct attacks to hard counter vaporeons ive managed to evolve both a vileplume and a victreebell but they both have poison attacks so i still dont have a good vaporeon counter yet so while sure vaporeons hit them for not very effective it still takes a while to take down the vaporeons because im just hitting them with regular attacks instead of super effective
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the bad thing about two of the big three grasses is you might roll poison moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,grass attackers are quite easy to obtain maybe in your area they are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the whole point of an analysis is to remove bias to say it depends on our zone playstyle and other people playstyle on your zone is a goalpost shift that concludes something everybody already knows these analyses are derived from a sample of the population it does not good to point out that there is some place somewhere that challenges the norm when the defining the norm is the goal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what did you simulate though what was your dodging strategy i suspect no dodging or random since the hyperbeam snorlax shouldnt be where it is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well what happen if the vaporeon gets randomly kick out first the point is its random youre not safe even if your on top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no dragonite is not a great defender but like i said in the end its all about cp putting the highest cp in a gym secure your spot longer the point of random is that putting up even the highest cp or the best defender doesnt secure anyone a position to hold a gym tossing in a low level cp will just make it even worst with this in mind people would rather put in their best defender and hope they dont get a chance to get randomly kick from the gym i dont mind getting kick randomly because its kinda boring sitting at the top at least it puts me in a position to go back and toss in my pokemon something to do other than farming dratinis all day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed in my experience of battling dragonite absolutely should not be i wince far more if i see a big poliwrath or slowbro in a gym than if i see a dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,earthquake interesting you list earthquake when lists floated out with how easy something is to dodge factored in the creators in that had the option that earthquake was the hardest to dodge you see from that one example then that how easy something is to dodge is just too subjective of a measure of ever include
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the other extreme can be just as bad say twister on gyarados now you dont even need to dodge because its just so pathetically low damage and you clear the battle faster than if gyarados had a bar move since youd have to stop dps to dodge that one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the of this is that you need to get an accurate gauge of the dodging skills of enemy players in your area if many of them dont dodge the move its still better to use even if you dodge them every time im like you that i tend to assume im facing competent opponents however i have lost count of how many level players that just eat solar beams to the face without a care in the world when we battle gyms together
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are exceptions earthquake psychic blizzard are all hard and awkward to dodge and thus put lots of damage on board or make you dodge a lot more to avoid them resulting in more damage received at the end anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but what if for example you just considered the defenders performance against the pokemon it proved weakest to thats gonna make a world of difference already and theres not much subjectivity in it other than the choice of the number which youd be free to vary and as far as i can see the only thing it doesnt take into account is the rarity of these pokemon ie in practice a defender would be weaker if effective counters can be easily found and everyone has them if you do it that way you at least account somewhat for the fact that most people are likely to choose a pokemon out of that top because theyll tend to be effective type counters in this table some pokemon probably rank highly just because theyre strong against a bunch of attackers that no one would ever bring out against them even though the attackers that people actually use tank right through them im looking at you arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,soooooooo if they have a high cp electric type with a good moveset that makes ice punch pretty bad hrmmm seems like a big enough if that ill continue to rate my bubbleice punch poliwrath among the best thanks though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,while i understand your view i am optimistic that change and balance are still being worked on the first months niantic was catching up to the overwhelming success they have been working on global roll out this whole time too i think in some respects the fact that they have a full work plate and they has only been out months is a reason for optimism for the future
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im quietly campaigning for an update that puts a day lock on a device after a different account is used so for days after that account is signed in only that account can be signed in it can be signed out just not a different account signed in after the day lock you can change accounts again but doing so would start another day lock it would end multiaccounting instantly it would stop people running assassin accounts to kick out their own team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also contrary as to what udopaminedelight thinks iv doesnt matter except for getting the cp on a pokemon as high as possible for its level a iv vaporeon at cp will do just as well as a iv vaporeon at cp

TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me too ive even started using seadra to beat down big arcanine if the gym is small and i dont need to use my pokemon repeatedly theyre almost laughably easy to beat if you dodge and user a good water attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well vapes are easily countered with exeggs or any of the other wide array of grass attackers that are readily available exeggs are easily countered with all the flareons people were disappointed to get when trying to get vapes arcanine and the wide array of bugs that are available dragonite is countered by so many different mon the only thing it has going for it is a high cp against low level players the vaporeon meta is so july everyone has a bunch of exeggs now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its on the picture bottom wwwpokegorankcom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,growlithe caught amount is actually of my pidgey caught amount even with the event change i have still caught about growlithe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats what my collection looks like except with arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aww man i thought i had a lot wheres your growlithe nest we had one in denton but its long gone now its an electabuzz nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im annoyed because i have hatched two growlithe one during double candy now around candy neither hatch was highiv so disappointing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was about to reply to the same comment and then saw youve basically said most of what i was going to say you want speed take a squad consisting of the few overpowered attackers and melt through a lineup added bonus in most cases you wont have to dodge nearly as much as when type leveraging with lower tier attackers which is also a time saver but i suppose thats more noob tactics as for this the people battling for speed effiecientcy matchups and tactics will always be the better battlers short term and long term for when metta changes they will have a better poke variety and arsenal as well for when quests come out i personally dont use an all vaporeon army but when im soloing a strong gym i basically only draw from the same species of pokemon and spam as much as possible while still getting the fullclear bonus so probably noob tactics trouble is when im prestiging im always leveraging type matchups with massive level handicaps so i have a large army of trainers and have to actually focus on dodging and the like so dont see how my noob tactics when battling enemy gyms is going to disadvantage me when the meta changes or when if quests come out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in uk dragonitea remain very rare you might see dratini occasionally but even one a day is unusual until this event i was on dratini candies total at level it does actually make for a wider gym meta which is really nice remains useful still since its really only vaporeon thats really available of the cp set so we are slowbro vaporeon poliwrath with occasional lapras or snorlax but rarely high cp which seems a lot better than dragonite or gtfo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is mostly a luck based factor thats being charitable its either luck based or cheating based
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or people were attacking with suicide squads of pigeottos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exeggcutor makes it differents moveset get diffetent spots if i remember correctly only bhp poliwrath was on the
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely ice sharddragon pulse lapras is a powerhouse in defense usually the attacker will choose a pokemon with resistance to ice so the type bonus for ice moves is cancelled out meaning that ice beam and dragon pulse do the same damage and the ai likes to fire it off regularly also against an attacking lapras its the best charge move lapras just doesnt have a bad charge move
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,with victreebell i actually prefer acid as a quick attack you dont get se against water but its still stab and quicker to execute so its easier to dodge whatevers coming my way my one razor leafleaf blade bell is just so painfully clunky that i rarely use it for attacking any more unless theres only one water type in the gym if i need it to take out more than one vape or whatever ill switch to acidsolar beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im really tired of catching bulbasaurs really
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the strategy is dodge if possible and dodge specials only it means you attack normally and when the defender starts its special attack you try to dodge if youre not in the middle of your attack theres a time window for that that varies for each attack minimum i dont know why hb snorlax came out first i suppose its high damage compensated for all the tmes it got dodged body slam can also be dodged its harder but if you become an expert in dodging i guess youll have no problem with it not my goal i barely dodge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no then ppl will just put in low cp pokemon like a weedle and be safe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my level bubblehydro poliwrath beckons you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it could be that most often than not i am facing earthquake with a vaporeon and dodging with a vaporeon is quite easy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,low damage stopping for one bar we are talking best defenders here so no prestige battles which means not only do you counter him your mon is also fairly strong unless you wanna feel like a hero and challenged yourself to use weaker mons for said gym when do you ever not finish the battle before he charged up his in my experience never which makes on twister more damage already and two twisters are more damage than dodged pump if you somehow happen to encounter a before pwning the gyarados
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ice punch hits hard against grass and dragon so its good against a player who doesnt know its coming and assumes to use grass or dragon as a logical counter to water but against basically anything else strong or neutral vs ice defender poliwrath does more damage spamming bubble than using ice punch which he does best paired with hydro pump
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sure some people would just get a cheap dummy phone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,iv doesnt matter except for getting the cp on a pokemon as high as possible for its level you sure gamepress lists ivs as factoring in to the damage formula attackbase attackattack ivcpmhttpspokemongogamepressggcpmultiplier assuming thats legit your example is mostly false the vape would have an attack number that is higher than the other although that difference may not make a difference in damage output most of the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont follow what youre saying at all no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed arcanine is one of my favourites to take down in a gym as vaporean wipes the floor with it fast and over of my pokemon are water it makes it useless to defend a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but exeggs only have a grass move as their charge attack and some just have all psychic that messes up direct counters exegg is a less perfect counter to vaporeon and fire types are less perfect against an exegg defender
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exeggcutor isnt as great a counter because of the psychic quick move and even then most people have much more water pokemon at their disposal than grass at least in my area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my growlith nest is my entire city lol wish i had so many water pokemon though have vapes and like flareons jolteons and all i want are vapes neither of them had hydro pump meanwhile i have over arcanines just chilling actually transfered a few a while ago but still have over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mayfield park in austin two migrations before that it was redbud isle dog park which is should have stayed because thats just too perfect
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bit of a generalisation to say the whole of the uk more likely just in suburbsrural areas im in london and there are loads of gyms now with to dragonite in albeit many of them spoofersbots in central one of the days from this event where i was trying i managed dratini in one day and im only level so not one of the more hardcore players some of them manage plus every day so there are places here where dragonite defines the meta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah im not the only one going for desperate measures when low on potions d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whats your opinion on razor leafsolar beam my one and likely only venusaur rolled this and im a little unsure obviously vine whip is better
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the reply i just found it odd as hyperbeam is probably the easiest of all moves to dodge the animation is completely obvious and you have lots of time to prepare for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should post your data at least an example also can you normalize by the highest for attacking and defending having the top be or whatever feels meaningless also id include the next best few movesets and their percentages compared to the best with that this could actually be useful right now its just a mess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how would a weedle be safe good grief its random second that your not helping your gym by putting your best defender if your best defender is a weedle then you might as well dont need to play
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just got a bubblehydro poliwrath last night should i be more excited about this guy i didnt even power him up was planning on using him for offense because of the charge move should i power him up and use him as a gym defender sorry for the newb questions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,shudder
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont spend as much stardust or candy on my attackers because i need high cp defenders and im definitely not powering up an electric type when theyre essentially wastes of stardust at the moment as such my current answer to gyarados is a cp poundhyperbeam wigglytuff since it resists bite and dragon type moves and deals high dps neutral damage while having enough hp to take out another defender after and ive found that when i fight hydro pump gyarados at cp or more it ends up getting a hydro pump off before it dies i know for sure id rather face a twister gyarados than a hydro pump one im sorry your experiences differ
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you are willing to pay for double data lines then you win
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the iv vaporeon is going to be a higher level and therefore have a higher cpm i think youre double dipping on cpm here a level vaporeon with iv will have a cp of and a level vaporeon with iv will have a cp of the former has an attack of a defence of and a stamina of the latter will have an attack of a defence of and a stamina of thats very little difference and mostly comes down to the stats being arranged slightly differently in terms of total stats thats vs so the lower iv higher level one has more combat stats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,less than perfect a single exegg w solar beam or seed bomb can beat equal level vapes with a medium level advantage vapes are koed before they ever get a chance to use a charge move and a single exegg could sweep a whole gym since water gun does nothing to an exegg its just a fact the idea that the whole gym meta is based on vaporeon is a relic of the past when everyone was low level and few had candy evos when most peoples best pokemon was their vape heck i dont even use my vaporeons anymore sits in a gym collecting coins and dust i might bring up another pulse vape to do the same nowadays you can safely assume that anything that can be countered relatively easily will be a nidoqueen is no worse of a defender than a vape both are readily countered by pokemon that everybody that participates in gyms has nidoqueen might actually be the better defender since it does neutral damage to dragonites the attackers that actually matter to lvl gyms almost all have dragonites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eggs resist water attacks and deal stabse damage charge moves which are charged by neutral high dps stab moves venusaur has the grass quick moves a zhsb exegg deals more damage to a vape than a vwsb venusaur at a given level venusaur does more damage per cp im sorry but eggs wipe the floor with vaporeon quality matters not quantity i will submit that good water pokemon are easier to get than good grass pokemon but by the time someone reaches the level where they can participate in the gym game in a relevant way pretty much everyone has a good grass attacker if not several
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have vapes theyre unimportant to me many have or better ivs ive only caught like growlithe and all have shorty ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vw is better but against vaporeonpoliwrath you have a good matchup anyway i tried with both movesets and theres nearly no difference against vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i know the simulator assumes the player notices whenever a move starts independently of its animation i feel i can notice it myself i look at the pokemon movements rather that the attack animation you just have to wait for a move pattern different than the one it uses for the quick move recently i noticed the name of the charge move appears on the screen after the attack is done was it always this way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,he uses hydro pump more often than any other gym defender afaik so it throws people off quite a bit i recommend it typically he defends nicely near the bottom half of a gym he is a real pain to fight even if youre dodging most of his attacks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just got a bubblehydro poliwrath last night my only one is a mud shothydro and its crazy high ivlevel so close
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,electric types have advantages over of the listed almost half ive had great success with my attacking pokes of which are electric because the top tier defenders are mostly water or flying which are weak to electric magneton jolteons and raichu completely rip apart lapras poliwraths vapes dragonites slobros and hypnos theyre also fast dodgers with high attack rates so they arent that bad against snorlax either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,itsnot personal preference or experience its solid math of taking more damage dodging hp hits you for with dragon resistance two twisters do and hp dodge makes you deal less damage in that window wheres room for preference here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax doesnt have twister or generally charges considered worthless nor does he have hard counters and that scenario wasnt discussed but even then snorlax has better charge moves considering damage taken per fight compared to hb
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well you could use the one phone to hotspot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i made a small mistake with my numbers but if you take a vape at cp and a vape at cpthese numbers are closer to your stated then the has a marginally higher attack my main point was that you made a blanket statement that iv only matters for cp purposes when it factors into every damage calculation your examples are pokemon at different levels and not at the same level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,of course they do but not as well as vaporeon wipes the floor with arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when trading comes up hook me up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive only seen the delayed text when im getting spammed with not very effectivesuper effective which i wish theyd fix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well ill be damned he sounds perfect for my small town gyms with mostly pokemon the teams here are pretty organized so a good defender is going to be more useful than just a high cp defender since we know the enemy team wont be intimidated by high cp plus im more in need of good gym defenders going to power him up immediately thanks for the info
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this was my one my perfect one got mud shothydro as well lol its actually pretty good on offense mud shot does good damage and is relatively quick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,unfortunately they dont allow much room for error being resistant to hardly anything and having both low hp and defense especially for pokemon of similar level for the listed pokemon i just use exeggutor against the water types especially poliwrath and slowbro arcanine against lapras lapras against dragonite and while i will admit i do not have a resistant se counter to hypno i will probably default to a lickhyperbeam snorlax for that or whatevers left over from attacking other defenders maybe a vaporeon or arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im doing less damage during hydro pump so ive taken longer to kill the defender so the move has served its purpose i have to watch for hydro pump and cant effortlessly spam attacks like i can with twister twister really just doesnt deal enough damage for me to see it as a threat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would lock by mac address i think andor perhaps game install yeah they would have to validate over cell or something idk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you made a blanket statement that iv only matters for cp purposes i didnt umrrmlt did but if you take a vape at cp and a vape at cpthese numbers are closer to your stated then the has a marginally higher attack yes and the vape will presumably have higher stamina youre talking about a level iv vaporeon vs a level iv vaporeon the lower level higher iv one has attack defense and stamina the higher level lower iv one on the other hand has attack defense and stamina thats very similar with rounding youre looking at a difference of defense and stamina between the two and the only difference is as a result of the ivs giving a different stat ratio my main point was that you made a blanket statement that iv only matters for cp purposes when it factors into every damage calculation your examples are pokemon at different levels and not at the same level it is impossible to have two pokemon with the same species same cp same level and different ivs cp is derived from level base stats and iv if you increase iv while keeping cp the same then you have to also be lower level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whether you can beat or opponents is rather irrelevent in all but very lopsided gyms again because it need repeating that the gym meta is based on vaporeon is so july its very outdated everyone that actually matters to your gyms defenses can counter everything that can be countered easily this is why in the new meta is cp is king and in this meta arcanine is very valuable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no problem before this event eevee were my third most caught after pidgy and ratatta im hoarding a few low cp but high iv ones just for trading too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the purpose of defender is to make efforts to stop you from winning or even fighting in the first place seconds wont make me consider the fight annoying or harder getting lower on potions will im sure thats the case for most people that have to fight to get gyms more than train in convenient scenarios
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well whomever made whatever statements iv matters but maybe not as much as its commonly made out to be but the overall point is that ivs do matter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agree to disagree its october and i still get excited when i see someone arcanine as a defender in a gym im about to take thats my october brain thinking october thoughts in the month of october because of october meta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whether you can beat or opponents is rather irrelevent i absolutely disagree the fundamental point of a good defender is to bleed the attacker so he runs out of items or decides to take down some other gym instead your defender is going to get countered but you just want to make it as messy as possible vape vs arcanine is about the cleanest matchup in the game arcanine is definitely valuable for its cp and as an attacker but this infographic is about actual performance as a gym defender piloted by the ai
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eevees are relatively common for me eevee for pidgey ratio but my evolution luck is awful getting a lot of flareons and jolteons but no vapes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea i feel the same way ive caught about eeveepidgy ratio ive made total vapes most either having high ivs or best move set not usually both next gym battle ill probably power one up over its not that necessary but i still see lots of arcanines even after the nest migration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it should be possible to attack a gym from a greater distance ie if you see a gym on your screen im sorry but it sounds as a terrible idea as there are still people that play unfair and it would be harder to identify them i used to hate gym stagnation now im slowly learning to use it to my advantage taking down gym you have a mon in a gym prestiging a gym you have a mon in a gym both require hard work and resources but the results are shockingly different
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spamming crappy posts about unbalance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really dont think theyre doing it as any kind of strategy its literally just trolling
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this strategy would never work in my area put a cp pokemon in a gym and that gym will fall long before you can get enough other gyms to be worth collecting even if you did it really late at night it would take a long time to get to hours at least and someone would take some of them back before you finished so youd never get to gyms and by the next night all the gyms would be back to level finally even it does succeed taking a gym costs far more resources then reviving a defender anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do this when a i have cashed in my coins for the day b when i want to fight a gym for fun because its supposed to be fun c when i know the gym wont last an hour anyway sometimes i will just leave the gym empty
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can imagine scenarios where this guy is not doing this for trolling lets say he is in the minority team he knows he will be soon out putting in a good pokemon makes no sense to him as well his solution could be to put in trash that he can send away after getting kicked out and he doesnt need revives for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i sorta do that but i use fire and forget pokemon say i catch a cp eevee and it has iv i evolve it and lucky me i get a cp vaporeon great i take a gym dump this pokemon in and haul off to the next one once there i dump in another high cp low iv pokemon say a cp exegcute that went into a cp exeggutor and move on i dont normally get gyms a day but at my best before gen ii i was getting then later in the day when all of these gyms have invariably flipped i transfer the pokemon ive titled as so i can sort by name without reviving them saves me potionsrevives worth notingmy fainted pokemon toll this weekend peaked at over im currently at fainted with an additional less than hp the only reason its that low is that this morning i decided to be lazy and just collect the one gym that had made it through the night instinct doesnt do well in my area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds like the issue is that this individual is taking down gyms isnt that how the game is supposed to be played someone adds prestige the gyms and places a pokemon in then someone else takes the gym down and places their pokemon in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw a variation on this last weekend theres a stretch of lowspeed road near my home with a dozen stopsmost of which can be spun from a car and two gyms one of which is right above a row of parking spots any given time of day you can see people slowing cruising up and down the street refilling their bags i was doing that sunday when some valor joker in a black car with heavily tinted windows parked under the gym then a mystic gym took it down and put in a mon and then just sat there sure enough within a couple minutes a woman in a minivan pulled up two spots over took the valor mon out and put in an instinct one in the minutes it took me to fill my bag i watched this happen more times i was going to go over and take the red mon out and drop in a junk shellder but before i could valor got bored of messing with people and drove off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a related question assuming you arent collecting coins at that time is anything else gained by putting one in as opposed to taking down a gym and leaving it empty experience counting toward a medal im wondering if theres anything to be gained by putting one in and then later having to revive or trash it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks my town has gyms you can hit in about a minute drive with more only minutes further out add in time to battle the gyms i can go from to gyms legitimately in about minutes less if there are less than pokemon at any of the gyms more if they have high cp pokemon additionally nothing is open past midnight except bars only on fridays and saturdays and hardly anyone is out that late and this happens most often between midnight and and sometimes in the middle of the workschool day between and some of the gyms in the neighborhoods go days without being taken down ive even tried wrecking their plan by waiting or minutes and taking down their low cp gyms but they come right back and take it over again within a few minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive left gyms empty before but only in response to people doing this to begin with at the gym down the street from my house ive seen some guys get out of their cars stomping and swearing for minutes before driving off way above the speed limit ftr ive seen these empty gyms go untouched for sometimes hours ive heard this can get you banned if too many times someone sends in a complaint to niantic under the category im at this gym and no one is here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can see that but its several different playersaccounts oddly a majority of them are from instinct at least different accounts ive come to recognize but some from mystic and valor as well in my area instinct and valor are the most common teams i hardly see any mystics
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have to admit i like your idea thanks for sharing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i disagree and its several people in hightraffic areas maybe but you dont think it takes the fun from other players how is it fun to oneshot all my opponent pokemon why would i want to add my pokemon to a friendly gym where one slot is taken up by a cp nidoran wheres the challenge in taking down a cp nidoran with a cp attacker the whole mechanic of battling suffers in my opinion wheres my challenge im always a little disappointed when i go to claim and my gyms were taken down but thats the game the hyperspecific instance of low cp gym trolling is in my opinion worse than when they changed prestige mechanics the first time its also not just one person its at least different people from instinct and from mystic and valor theres no challenge and hence no fun in taking down a cp nidoran with a cp attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think it could be because a tier gym takes at least battles to take down it deters opposing players from taking your gym down especially in low traffic areas or places where they can do drivebys as said in another comment sometimes even the two or three minutes it takes to knock out one defender is enough to prevent someone from taking over a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it stops opposing teams from dropping in defenders as they drive by sometimes even the two or three minutes it takes to knock out one defender is enough to prevent someone from taking over a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no i dont think so maybe thats another idea how niantic could fix this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats the thing there are never three pokemon in the gym in my area or almost any area actually at least since gen ii came out its minimum and almost always at least so thats your way to beat this person get all the gyms to level itll cost him way more resources to take them down then it does for any of the individuals training them up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it could also be that people might do this because they know the gyms are high turnover and dont build up anyway i have done this in the past sometimes i just kick people out of gyms because they sniped gyms from me or are spoofers and leave the gyms blank
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also saved up a hair under eevee candies for gen iisoooo i have a few to sparestill sitting near
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont understand your position its okay to take down gyms but not to leave a low cp defender when you do assuming its okay to take down the gyms why are you concerned with what they leave in afterward if nothing else they are making it easy for a low level casual player to take a gym and get rewards did i misunderstand your point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why dont you just add prestige over the cp nidoran that is how a lot of teams get their gym to lvl fast and hold it they use the bubblestrat mechanic to get to level then they add their pokemon in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i definitely must live in a low traffic area some of these gyms will stay for days or more and get up to as high as level with all low cp pokemon from lv players if they put up higher cp pokemon it would make the game more fun imagine if you could oneshot all the ai and trainer pokemon in the handheld games id be so bored
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i live in a low traffic area there are only a handful of high turnover gyms and they most often get skipped when someone is dropping low cp pokemon in they also come back and retake low turnover gyms if you knock them out within about minutes past minutes ish they leave you alone its pretty obvious theyre doing it for coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why would i want to add my pokemon to a friendly gym where one slot is taken up by a cp nidoran even if its friendly why would i want to add my pokemon to a friendly gym where one or more slots are taken up by a cp nidoran i dont understand how this scenario is fun for everyone it makes an otherwise fun game boring for me and my kids did you think the first change to prestige mechanics was fun too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres no challenge and hence no fun in taking down a cp nidoran with a cp attacker the whole mechanic of battling suffers in my opinion wheres my challenge you only have to take down pokemon to drop gym prestige you can already take down a gym by fainting pokemon flee heal faint mon flee heal faint another etc i think what youre saying is the gym system is already flawed so who cares
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my area there a number of gyms that turn over every hour regardless of what defender or combination of defenders you use many of the others turn over at least twice a day why would i waste a good defender on those on the other hand to directly answer your question i usually look for higher level at least level gyms to prestige and to place my good defenders if the first defender or two is low level they likely will get shaved either by a casual attacker or by a cheating teammate with an alt account they are therefore irrelevant to me once they are gone someone maybe me will prestige the gym back up so a good defender can take its place its so easy to prestige any gym to level that i dont really see much of a problem with one low cp garbage mon obviously ymmv edit minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so yes its obvious to me i live in a low traffic area some of these gyms will stay for days or more and get up to as high as level with all low cp pokemon from lv players if they put up higher cp pokemon it would make the game more fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would agree although i enjoy tearing down high level opposing gyms i get far more pleasure from helping builddefend a strong gym that lasts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,right i just dont see the point in winning a game i cant lose anyway i would never have played the original games if i could oneshot all the ai trainer pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have caught venusaur and evolved one afterwords i proceeded to amass bulbasaur candy they are incredibly common where i live and havent had even the slightest problem catching them theyre actually easier to catch than half the pidgey i encounter so im sure youre just incredibly unlucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,running after the first throw sounds like you were softbanned for a period of time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have evolved and caught three venesaur and i still catch a few bulbasaurs a day without any trouble myself i have evolved the others to their second form and i havent seen an increase in the flee rate either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure but i have noticed that i have a harder time trying to catch wild starter mons than other mons squirtles bulbasaurs and charmanders have been giving me a very hard time independent if i use just a regular pokeball or if i use berriesgreatballs etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its only bulbasaur though not any other mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so maybe i noticed it in bulbasaurs but its actually a broader phenomenon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not sure haha all i know is that they give me a hard time when trying to catch in the wild compared to most mons ive caught so far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its probably just bad rng
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have only percent to catch something amazing so is really not a lot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,found three with good ivs out of maye charmander at wartortle at bulbasaur at
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just got a perfect bubla youre just having bad rmb unfortunately
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i found a charmeleon iv after the event started
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,impressive huntingive caught less than and one of them was a charmander over with perfect attack the rng giveth luck and rng taketh luck away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i literally just caught a charmander like a block from my house the rest of my starters from the event total crap
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,event just started youve caught about already
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got a one with above at least and i have only caught a few
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got a one with above at least and i have only caught a few
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,found a bulba and it was probably my catch after the event started its just luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just caught charmanders both were iv
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea ive got about charmanders in the last day and were wonderous caught squirtles and were wonderous rng gods only favour the great
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it definitely could be and i hope it is bad rng rather than some weird event oddity i was hoping other people could check appraisals as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its actually closer to i believe so my catches were quite the outlier prompting my post thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whew thanks awesome bulbasaur btw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,am i the only one that sees screen shots like this and tries to click the x at the bottom to go back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks glad to know its just bad luck rmb chinese currency p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks im glad it was just bad rng as odd as that sounds
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre giving me too much credit camped four overlapping lures with plenty of people around for two hours almost every other spawn was a starterevolved
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,camped overlapping lures for a few hours probably around other players around and the starter rate was from lures blastoise ivy charmeleon as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cheers just keep hunting em theyre out there to be found
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,apple autocorrect 😭😂
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dang thats impressive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yessir
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats what you get for being a
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sure the ren cen will be similar d i live in ann arbor
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when you first activate location services the phone will estimate the location using the quickest method available which is the location of the mobile phone tower that the phone is connected to this is a lot faster than waiting for a gps fix once the gps fix happens the location is updated to the more accurate gps coordinates
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea its gps drift i can mimic it consistently on my iphone as well it happens when i put the app in the background for about seconds dont close the app then switch back to it i pop up about three blocks over as well and then pop back to my actual location
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in some places at my house gps is horrible and drift is pretty crazy and it seems to always have a path or go to a specific spot its always the same place in the forest about from my house sadly there is nothing there on the way there so i cant use it to get to pokestops etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep if i wake my phone up downtown itll usually either snap to midwestlake or up to cal anderson try having the app on when youre headed into the metro tunnel it flips out like nobodys business and usually snaps me to westlake before going blank i think its related in some way to stops you commonly use because im never anywhere near the pioneer square area and thus never get snapped to stops around there assuming you mean wells fargo on ave whereas im always dicking around at westlake and up capitol hill it must somehow remember what stops you frequent when it loses location data thats a little creepy but hey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the point it snaps back to is one that i do pass by occasionally but dont ever spend any significant amount of time at and i believe it would be at least a week since i was last over in that vicinity if it wanted to pick a point im at frequently id expect it to pick something closer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah the westlake waterfall thing isnt exactly my stop either im there maybe once a week yet thats where i end up when locations lost same with cal anderson really only hang out when the weathers nice meanwhile i hit every stop up from convention place to sccc neardaily but never snap to them maybe certain stops or areas count as sort of landmark zones like thats the center of whatever grid square youre on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i delete berries weak potions and revives to keep them at a low stock because i dont battle gyms anymore or just once for defender bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you know when people suddently start posting stuff like hey is it just me or x doesnt drop as much since yesterday i trash all of that particular item just the day before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent deleted a single pokeball most of the time i catch everthing i see so i run out of balls pretty quick i dont really participate in gym attackingdefending im more of a collector type so heres my list potion revive super potion berries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont access gyms often so i tend to throw away potions of all types i keep a minimal amount because you never know one day my phone might not crash at a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will never use of the razz berries the game tries to give me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get rid of automatically of potions super potions then revives i like to keep but ive tried keeping and before just trying to look what the number that works better for me is pokeballs just for the chance of transforming a pokeball into a great or ultra ball as for the rest right now im keeping it all no matter what i tried some time ago discarding berries but i regretted it shortly after i got a drought of berries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use up as many weak potions as i can a lot of the time i will yolo train gyms with a bunch of different stuff and not bother healing it up if i cant justify the hug potion on it then i drop regular potions and super potions i keep regular revives below and stock up on max potions and max revives i try and save the max stuff for big time attacks i pretty much hoard ultra and great balls until i have a crapload then go visit a super spawnzone i found and run incense until my balls are gone then i pretty much am stocked up to do gyms while i refill my good balls and repeat the process
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first i use what i can revive a dead pokémon and use my regular potion to heal it deleting whats left after i heal everyone if i havent used all the regular potion already that clears up spaces depending on cp after that i get all my other potions to about the same number usually around depending on if i plan on trainingtaking gyms then raspberries they build quickly keep maybe next is poke balls down to around for regular and greats i always keep my ultras but havent stayed above of those before using them my bag space is fwiw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,revives and berries even though im active in gym fighting i still always have a lot more revives than i need never pokeballs as im always low lots of pokemon not that many pokestops after revives and berries i grundgingly part with some potions a lot of people throw all potions and super potions away but i find it hard to use a hyper potion to heal thats a waste of half the potion and i have yet to use a single max potion im just hoarding them until the time ill deem a pokemon worthy of their awesome power
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion super potion hyper potion revive raspberry great ball used to be regular ball until pogo i dont fight gyms much so i only keep max potions around for the most part and a handful of revives i dont use many raspberries because theyre too annoying to apply and most pokemon i can catch with onetwo great balls right now regular balls are like gold because i chew through them with the plus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you get pogo regular pokeballs become almost more valuable than greatultra balls i never can have enough of them considering the amount that i go through in a day the order i get rid of things is berries to regular and super potions revives combined between max and regular to rest of the stuff usually equals out well enough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,red balls only
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here is what my bag composition currently looks like and my ideal potion super potion hyper potion max potion revive poke ball great ball ultra ball razz berry my composition i try to keep potions revives balls berries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,depends on what im about to do either pokeball or potionsuper potion if im going to be doing gyms next the balls are first to go and vice versa if i plan to catch stuff after that revive and eventually hyper potion are on my trash list i of course prefer to use the items however inefficiently rather than trash them if possible
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions and revives always and only i dont live near many gyms so i have never found myself with too few of either while i have come close to running out of pokeballs several times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hp potions revives i have gym in my area i cant battle so much i havent seen level gyms for days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i delete all potions and revives because i want as many balls as possible
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,red pokeballs and raspberries i fight too much to get rid of potions and revives and my bag is at now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions i dont do gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions super potions revives i try to keep about around there are tons of pokemon spawns near my work and a couple at my home so im always out of pokeballs i stock up over the weekend and try to stretch them through the week by only catching good stuff i can hit a couple pokestops here and there during the week but not enough to keep me in supply
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs i delete them at a time to make room for pots razz berries i delete when i have more than bring it down to or so revives i only need not smallest potions are next i dont need more than of those so delete at a time this generally leaves me with about great balls heh currently have ultra balls razz berries i prefer to have closer to super pots go through so many so fast tend to have somewhere in the of hyper pots and separately max pots im usually digits of max revives so yeah i always have way too many balls i throw great balls most frequently ultra balls behind that and regular balls least not enough pots
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,always the regular potions first then poké balls i have never had to dump anything else really
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i maxed out my inventory space and i delete items from my inventory after almost every pokestop i do not often partake in gym battles which id say is the most significant factor in my inventoryrelated decisionmaking i have also recently purchased a pokemon go device so i still have a need for regular pokeballs i keep as many great and ultra balls as possible i also have razz berries i keep max potions and revives currently in case of a gym battle the rest of my space is filled up with regular pokeballs and incubators as well as a couple lucky eggs incense and lures i have acquired through leveling i delete all potions super potions and hyper potions immediately i have no use for excess max potions or revives ive also deleted plenty of regular pokeballs before getting the pogo while trying to acquire as many greatultra balls as possible my inventory currently consists of max potions revives lucky egg incense pokeballs great balls ultra balls lure module razz berries and incubators ive capped off my great balls at because i was running out of regular pokeballs for my pogo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion super potion revive i dont gym at all so theyre not that helpful to me down to hyper potion because i have a case of final fantasy elixiritis and dont want to get rid of everything on the off chance i decide to start doing gyms at some point down to razz berry i tend to forget to use them down to poke ball not too likely unless ive spent a good deal of time with multiple stops and less pokemon down to great ball not likely down to ultra ball haha yeah right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in the early days i used to dump revives first now because of the gym update i tend to hoard them my now dump are normal potions and now super potions sometimes pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs and raspberries the occasional revive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potionssuper potionsrevives to potions to i usually dont need to go below that i dont battle too much not enough timebattery life to do more than grab my pokecoins per day i catch far more than i battle and i hit pokestops on my commute one way walking to campus so i usually keep a pretty good equilibrium of pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion then super potion then revives i never get rid of any kind of pokeball my bag can hold up to items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions of all types revives red balls it drops waaaaay more potions than i need to keep up my and fight a few on the side for fun i usually use them up from weakest to strongest but rarely ever need to break into my max potions they just build and build and build so i toss them too on occasion when they get near back down to when i go ball farming i toss all potions but my max potions theyll build right back up in no time likewise with revives it drops waaaay more than i could ever need i try to keep it to minimum i play real reviveefficient i really only need them when i mess up prestiging or when ive been kicked from a gym i used to throw berries but now i use them a lot more and im typically on the side of running low if my bag is full when ball farming and i still have time to go ill toss red balls in hopes of converting them to yellowblue balls in the area i live there is easily a spawnpointpokestop ratio so balls are always a concern good old suburbia pokemon everywhere extremely sparse pokestops i go farm balls downtown times a week to augment feeble ball farming attempts daily near my house
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions start with the weakest and go up revives and razzberries my house has about pokestops within miles so a few walks around town fills me back up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion super potion berrys never pokeballs used to get rid of revives but im startin to attack high level gyms now so never again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poké balls potions super potions hyper potions max potions revives razz berries depending on how many i have of each of the three i very rarely toss razz berries and never toss great or ultra balls since i use them pretty often never left with too many i dont fight gyms that often i enjoy taking down level gyms though so ill go after one every couple of days and raze it to the ground i have bag space my ideal inventory that is actually somewhat reasonable ie isnt just ultra balls is poké balls great balls ultra balls razz berries max potions revives and other
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,berries i normally keep potion super potions hyper potions max potions revives and berries if i run out of room because im full of balls and need to pick up an egg for example then i start getting rid of berries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,balls and potions and if i have revives they have to go too i keep everything else often ill use the potions to heal instead of throwing away which saves me a few hyper potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im lvl so anything thats not max revive or max potion is deleted and i keep all type of pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all potions except hyper because unless you are going to go allin on gyms and play in groups at weird hours gyms are pretty dead where i live may as well have inventory i can actually enjoy using
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion super potion revive hyper potion i dont think ive dropped hyper potions before but that would probably be next id also never drop all my revives for me i can unload my pokeballs without any problem theres enough junk to throw them at that i will run out eventually no matter what i do i guess if i played only on this one street where i go to farm pokeballs i would hit inventory cap eventually but ive never been there long enough to get to the point that id drop pokeballs berries are similar to pokeballs since i can run out of pokeballs without any problems i will use excess berries on the tougher common catches id rather preserve excess pokeballs than excess berries i also tend to use potions and super potions very inefficiently because i dont need them that much i leave all my pokemon wounded until i need them or until i can fully heal them with weak potions my main worry is overloading on revives and max potions right now i am at almost of each so its eating a good chunk of my bag i maxed my bag at some point so i can hold items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs potion razz super revive in that order
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,razz pokeballs great balls i try to never throw out potions or revives as i usually try to power up gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all types of potions and revives as a rural player with pokemon stuck in stagnant mystic gyms i have no use for healing items but i do need pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a small army of bitehb raticates and watyphoon pidgeots i use them first when attacking a gym and then use my good attackers i leave them with low hpfainted afterwards when my bag geta full ill use my extra pots to heal this army of cannon fodders to free up some space
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,caveat my inventory is maxed out at i toss pokeballs until im down to then weak potions until im down to total potions or revives until im down to total revives my ideal allocation is total pokéballs potions revives razz berries and the rest is misc rationale being that pokéballs are aplenty but i will sometimes travel to a high rare low pokéstop area and will deplete my pokéball reservoir by balls at a time when i go on a stocking run and throw away junk i will sometimes have max potions max revives and great balls in those situations i oftentimes need to decide whether i want to throw a pokéball or a berry i usually opt for the ball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to save throwing the weak potions out i use them mostly post gym battles normally im battling gyms and need potions especially when trying to level up to get top slots so i mainly throw out ordinary balls then raz berries this is with a bag with spaces im mainly rural but get to make a minute walk every day when i go to work drive into the city real early walk around for minutes spinning every stop i can hit then drive back out to work this mornings walk was cancelled as it was sheeting it down with rain so my bag is a bit light today
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potionssupersrevives im rural and have bag space only gym within walking distance and competition is almost non existent i also just got a bubble strategy pair so i dont need to dump any resources into that gym but now i cant get my bubble mon out of the gym ive only dropped berries once but i should have dumped revives instead current inventory pots super hyper max revive pokeball great ultra berry never enough pokeballs have to go and stock up again in the nearby town miles each way bike ride i borrow my sisters bike but its almost dead
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i toss pokeballs when it hits max capacity i have a total inventory of my ideal balance is hyper potions revives pokeballs great balls as many ultra balls as i find razzberies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it just depends which items im lowest on or what im trying to get i usually try to keep a good balance so i can both catch pokemon and take on gyms a few weeks ago per day id discard pokeballs and or so berries to keep my totals at around each just to try to get any type of potions i had over super balls and over ultra balls and obviously i wasnt capturing pokemon at the rate i was hitting stops at the time the revives werent useful after training against enemy gyms either so id discard all but a handful of those conversely when i know im going to be traveling i dont try to take over gyms outside of my hometown and i stock up on pokeballs and discard potions and revives ive upgraded my bag storage and generally prioritize healing items to pokeballs these days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the first thing i get rid of is coins to buy more inventory i like my items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,raspberries revives and regular potions havent deleted anything else in a long time have to try to use as many berries as i get train more than i battle so my mon dont need to be revived often and all else fails a super potion does the job of a regular plus more so why not get rid of the regulars
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when im heavy on gym battles i keep everything i need for that and maintain space for potions and revives abundant and readily available dont use those much since spawns around are subpar balls master balls are more important only when i have more than of them super potions only when i have more than of them i have a item bag capacity when the goal is to catch mons potion keep i just dont use them that often but keep some just in case keep rather have other types keep at least i keep enough items to be able to switch from one playing goal to another with as little discomfort as possible and make room for more rare and more powerful stuff
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions revives and berries pokeballs if i have to i dont battle gyms muchjust once a day to get my coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get rid of all potions and super potions aside from the first of each so lucky eggs arent on my item screen every time i open it and theres no chance of accidentally clicking them then i ditch revives and hyper potions in whatever order i feel like ive only tossed away pokeballs once when i had like eight pokemon to heal and over pokeballs and it just felt wrong
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first of all i always get rid of revives first but i usually keep around on hand then goes the weakest aka normal potion then ive only had to do this once while in vancouver i get rid of the regular pokeballs in hopes of getting greatultra balls also sometimes berries ive literally never ran out of berries before and i use them on most of the mons i try to catch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get rid of all super potion and normal potions keep revives depending on how often i take gyms i keep everything else i have inventory slots though i keep pokeballsberries for weedlepidgeycaterpie because they keep running away if i dont use a berry and it saves me from using all my great and ultra balls sometimes ill ultra ball a weedle just because i dont want to waste pokeballs they really hate me lately for some reason
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i usually dont get a full bag but once it fills up the order of getting rid of items is regular potions super potions hyper potions max potions revives pokeballs if through some miracle im full and thinking of throwing away great balls thats when i know theres no point in further pokestop spinning i dont do much gym battling because of my inability to actually keep a gym long enough to get multiple coin bonuses
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions i usually have more than of them and when things get tight i prefer to trash some of them instead of pokeballs which are most of the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have set values for every nonball or berry type item and i usually just toss anything over those values those values are super potions hyper potions max potions revives the rest of my inventory is reserved for balls and berries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,berries pretty much useless imo pokeballs potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,never enough potions always enough balls boo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,firstly i will throw away berries until theres about left next time it fills if i have enough i will start using my revives and potions next time when my party is fully healed id throw away either pokeballs or potions whichever i have most of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep one of each potion type because i have an unused incense that ive almost triggered a few times keeping the potions push the good stuff down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,drop all super and normal potions pokeball down to revives down to berries down to i do this until im maxed with roughly those numbers then i drop all pokeballs and fill my bad up until i have a full bag with no poke balls and around those numbers on the other item i limit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i actually have quotas for all items personally i prioritize keeping all kinds of pokeballs the most i will retain at minimum hypermax potions favoring max berries revives favoring max revives once i hit i discard potions and hyper potions freelyimmediately if none of my fighters need healing immediately reasoning i have gotten pretty good at not letting any of my pokemon faint in gym battles and the only time i leave actual defenders is when the gym will be wellreinforced otherwise it gets evolutionexp fodder so i rarely use revives in any way and therefore only need potions which is why i retain so many catching is the name of the game so all space not specifically reserved for gym supplies are instantly reserved for pokeballs and berries because more catch rate is better than not more catch rate this is the primary way i gain stardust and therefore very important to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokéballs as a matter of fact i dont keep em at all anymore also my berries are always kept on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got item slots i always try to keep max potions of the other just to push the inventory so i cant accidentally click on lucky eggs max revives berries i know this may sound excessive but a couple of times ive burned almost on a few straight ultra rares the rest is for all the other balls and when my inventory is full when i have the stated amount of the items mentioned above i just delete regular pokeballs i currently have poke great and ultra
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spots balls potions only super and max revives berries that is how i keep my bag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all potions except for max potions all regular revives then poke balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,living in a major city where stops are plentiful the value of a pokeball is really low to me since its so common i usually dump pokeballs to because i need a few for pogo then in terms of potions i have been dropping normal potions and super potions because gym battles wont need them and bubblestrat training doesnt need them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i throw away my pokeballs first then berries then maybe some great balls if i have to because i have a ton of great balls and ultra balls i save all my potions and revives because my friends and i go out and take over at least gyms nightly so i really need them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am shocked at how many of you throw away so many potions i never throw them away and never have enough i have combined potions regularsuperhypermax and still need more as for me razz revives and regular balls are the only things ill discard everything else is useful stock once i get max revives ill start cutting down on regular balls i generally try to keep at least combined poke balls i used to think id be fine keeping or so balls until i ran across a dragonite who broke out of every last ball i had how he didnt run away is beyond me but it hurt a lot more staring at him with nothing else to throw now i keep a lot more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i never have this problem if i have too many pokeballs i start catching rattatas and visit a nest or lures if i have too many revivesbig potions i take down a few enemies if i have to many small potions i train friendly gyms rarely there are situations when i am near the limit then i use potion to heal my army of golduckshypnosjolteons that i sometimes use in battles and dont heal straight away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my rules are simple i never have more than pokeballs have more than superballs have more than ultraballs ive never ran out of all my pokeballs but ive never come across a dragonite either lvl currently regarding potions i try to never throw them because i battle often but when my backpack is full i become more wasteful with my potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i battle several gyms most days so ill typically go through potions per day easily so i generally trash a ton of pokeballs and keep a stock of great ballsultra balls and potions with pokeballs as filler
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thousands of pokeballs deleted every loop i toss or so i only deleted potions when i first started because i wasnt battling gyms since them ive never had the opportunity to delete a single potion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions then revives i need pokeballs in quantity for plus otherwise my third thing used to be deleting pokeballs i do defend gyms but usually dont attack i generally extricate myself before fainting so i dont need too many revives just the better potions i love berries i can always use them up is nothing to sneeze at if i have to use them on commons whatever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first revives i never need revives and i always end up with near after a day of walking around i only use berries on things im using ultra balls on so i discard a lot of those too sometimes i get down to of each of those and start discarding regular pokeballs because there isnt anything to capture i try to get every stupid pidgey and ratata there is just for the stardust i will absolutely never discard a potion though i need all the potions i can get for training and attacking gyms theyre so rare compared to revives and balls and i typically use the smaller potions up faster in order to optimize healing or are the most common amounts i heal only when i run out of the smaller ones will i start using the stock of bigger potions but that happens every day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just impose a personal cap in specific items so i never really end up capping bag space max pots regular pots super hyper revive no max revive cap they never get too high berry chain use them frivolously if im over pokeballs never really get high enough to need to cap
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs then potions then berries and super potions usually i would be aggressive towards high level enemy gyms if i have too many potionsrevives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,instadelete potions and super potions super worthless keep max combined hypermax potions delete the rest also keep max revives and delete the rest i only fighttrain occasional easy gyms or those with a shot at longevity try to keep berries if over i use them on pretty much everything until im back down to if bag is full i may delete some maybe once or twice have deleted a regular pokeball never a great or ultra ball i do feel for the poor urban players though until a few trips into the city i didnt realize how annoying having to constantly manage your bag really was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions super potions and some razzberries not all of them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for me it depends what i have in abundance last week i was throwing away berries and balls because id just used up my entire supply of revives and potions but this week i havent visited many gyms so i have heaps of potions usually though im on average emptying my bag faster than im filling it so its more about making sure i remember to head into the city every week to stock up again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for some reason my luck with better pokeballs and super potions is really bad i have a lot of potions a lot of hyper potions and barely any super at the pokeball front i get really bad lucky with great balls and recently only got to so cant say about ultra i think i will end up throwing hyper potions and razz to make room for pokeballs though days ago i managed to get my first backpack upgrade
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep hyper potions and revives and delete all potions and super potions i keep all poke balls sometimes i have to delete berries but i like to keep around
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty much the ops order with a bias to pokeballs since you always get more id never throw away a revive too valuable compared to other items more or less the same for berries use those quite regualrly and you dont want to run out the minute you run out a snorlax will suddenly appear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs followed by berries i tend to take gyms over the weekend so i need the potions and revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont necessarily have a hard delete first list i try to maintain a balance usually i keep my potions and revives capped around berries around my normal pokeballs around and pick up as many great and ultra balls with the balance depending on what my goal is these levels can increase for instance ill go heavy on base potions if im planning to bubble strat berries if im hunting mons with a chance at a rare etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i delete everything except for pokeballs ultraballs and paid items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am about to be level i get ride of all the potions except the hp but i am thinking i will have to soon also the revives i may have discarted around of each by now why you may ask because i currently live near an hospital so if i really wanted i could catch around pokemon in hours but there is no pokestops here so i have to travel km away to get to a park with pokestops and there is near cero pokemon spawns over there and i am in team instinct in a very active city i just try to get one gym x day and that doesnt needs that many potionsrevives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get rid of a lot like hundreds of regular pokeballs since theyre not very effective past level or so i keep and manage everything else since i gym battle quite a bit for me gyms are the primary reason i play i have pretty much figured out where to catch the mons i need in this neck of the woods the only way i have found to catch rarer ones are to reach higher levels
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,basic standard potions first always i seem to get them by far the most i do quite a lot of gym battling so i chew through other potions quite often and have a lot of bag space i get rid of potions then super potions then either revives or pokeballs depending on my recent finds from stops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,get rid of berries if i have over balls or potions depending on what i need more after that because anything i get from a pokestop can only be an upgrade or the same i pretty much fight to my potion capacity so its always useful for me to have them if im running heavy i might take down a level enemy gym otherwise i might only train or target small enemy gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm in order get rid of potions super potions some berries down to make me have the same number of reviveshyper potions get rid of pokeballs if i have
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have never deleted anything on purpose besides regular potions and that is a rare occurrence i just let my bag inventory influence my activities when needed if i have a surplus of potions i try to focus my time on battling if i have a surplus of balls then i spend more time hunting at dense spawn areas usually the nests closest to my house i enjoy both so its no big deal focusing on one or the other when i have to ive never upgraded my bag and i have a lot of pokestops nearby i get regularly if im running low on items in general ill spend time doing circuits of pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,regular revives i keep on hand to supplement max revives potion super potion pokeballs my goal is to collect from gyms daily so i usually have to retake or gyms each day i try to use all of the lowest level potions first after each battle because i hate throwing stuff away ill also get rid of pokeballs at a time if im on a restocking runegg hunt in the hopes of replacing them with greatultra balls im a rural player so some days i go to where there are more stops than pokemonthats where i stock up once every couple of weeks i drive hours to go to a great pokemon hunting spot that has zero stops and zero gyms for those trips i plan ahead and stock up on the maximum pokeballs of all varieties
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poke ball i have ultra balls and great balls no point in keeping the little ones razz berries i kept these forever but have taken myself from keeping about to keeping only i was never close to low on them and kept getting more after this i use up revives down to then use my potions and super potions up this keeps me consistently in the range for items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i drop in this order potion super potion revives down to or razzberries down to or pokeballs hyper potions down to i might start dropping great balls soon too im currently sitting around great balls and or so pokeballs since i use regular balls for the vast majority of pokemon and ultra balls for the ones that i really want to catch i really only use great balls if i run out of ordinary poke balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i play gyms a lot more than i got out and capture so i always throw out pokeballs granted at inventory space i have ultra great and regular balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all of them except for the yellow balls or the full restore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is always tricky but basically this is what i do keep a minimum of revives unless im planning on prestiging a few gyms in which case i might up it to you only really need these for mistakes missed dodges etc as you dont really need any revives for prestiging keep a minimum of max potions again might up this to or inclusive of hyper potions if im planning on levelling a few gyms keep a minimum of razz berries in case i come across something ultra rare i could probably cut this down to about though i toss all regular potions supers and hypers after that i toss any pokeballs to get to within capacity ive been doing more pokestops than hunting lately so im up to nearly great balls which is really cramping my bag space need to go on a big hunt to purge some of the balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,revives pokeballs red razzberries thats about it i dont attack much but prestige like crazy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i auto delete potions and super potions always delete any revives i have over delete all hyper potions if i have at least max potions delete base pokeballs if i am still full up the way i figure it is that if i delete pokeballs worst case scenario i get the same thing back best case scenario it upgrades to a better ball only occasionally does it get replaced with a max potion or max revive and put me in a dilemma because i am low on balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i delete revivespotions razzberriessuper potions and last pokeballs to try more great balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions berry pokeball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,always been kind of frugal with berry use given my limited motivation for catching things that arent particularly uncommon as such they build up pretty fast revives are something else i occasionally toss since i receive them much faster than i use them for some reason as for potions well they seem to be in higher demand for me with poké balls sitting in the middle as such razz berry revive poké ball potion thats honestly it though i hardly ever dispose of potions as it is and greatultra balls is out of the question
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions super potions hyper potions revive max potion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs have plenty of stops nearby and they drop regular pokeballs way more often than useful potions plus i battle a fair bit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i upgraded my bag once but afterwards i realized the space wasnt the problem now i stick to soft item count limits for bag management and toss the excess when space is low havent had problems since here goes first to go are always small potions and normal poke balls poke balls great balls berries hyper potions revives this core makes up about slots the remaining i use to collect ultras and max potions ill keep above the limits only if i have space after a gym or capture run otherwise this gives me slots to spin stops i keep large amounts of healing because i need to fight the people that try to build up gyms near my rural residence often i leave some attackers at low hp so i can use the small potions the next hours my daily commute to the city supplies me with plenty of ball restocks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a bag i discard all nonmax potions i keep max potion revive and berries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i spar at gyms a lot razz goes out first then some pokeballs then excess revives when over then maybe some regular potions or ill just train some more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im focusing on maxing out my pokemon storage so im constantly deleting items from my bag top deletion priority are pokeballs potions super potions revives and berries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get rid of what i have too much of that is typically regular pokeballs and low potions i keep enough berry to be able to use it with every great amd hyper ball i have
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs and berries theyre the most common from stops and you dont use berries that much imo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions super potions battle gyms to burn revives and hyper potions to further clear up inventory space
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i aim to keep ultra great balls berries potions revives and that leaves spots for miscellaneous lures eggs incense etc i recycle items according to which of those target levels are furthest from being filled
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dump revives to dump berries to dump all pokeballs revive everything and use regular potions to free space have only dumped great balls once i am usually sitting at great balls ultra potion super potion hyper and max potions i never need to dip into
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the first section i delete automatically poke ball potion super potion hyper potion then the rest is in order great ball razzberry revive max potion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,normal pokeballs revives thats all i never get rid of potions but i usually use my weakest ones first it only takes a few seconds longer than using a more powerful one but clears up your inventory faster and means you save more of the more powerful potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i throw away everything that isnt an ultra ball or a max revive because im not a casual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion pokeball super potion razz berry hyper potion great ball revive max potion ultra ball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs great balls berries i really need more potions fighting and training gyms is what i like i take care of valors gyms in my city and i try to keep the enemy gyms low level so mystic and instict keep going for eachothers low level gyms instead of the valor gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont battle that often so ive only run out of pokeballs and never potionsrevives but i hear of people running out potionsrevives and i anticipate battling more once i get my dragonite so potion super potion delete berries until i hit delete revives until i hit delete hyper potion until hyper potion max potion ive bought one bag upgrade btw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im more about gyms nowadays so poke balls berries keep minimum of and thats it i always have something to revive or heal so o use potions and revives rather than toss them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have an inventory size of at the moment i toss mostly poke balls and berries which i keep at and respectively to give way for more great and ultra balls i currently have of each i fight gyms daily so i try to keep of each kind of potions and revive no limit for max revives i actually dont have a limit for berries because i throw them most of the time because i believe poke ball berry great ball great ball berry ultra ball what do you guys think about this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,never throwing anything away oo why would i potions up until hyper potions are gone so quickly anyway lately great balls have been a lot harder to get for me so i switched to using pokeballs again thus not throwing these out either if you run out of inventory space upgrade theres ways of achieving that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am still grinding pokemon for xp so i need lots of balls i only take one gym a day because where i live it is too much hassle to try and go for more at the same time i am level btw i dump potions razzberries revives a few potions if needed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i delete all potions only because i found the perfect bubblestrat all my and are gone everything else is dedicated to the grind and battling inventory drops by every hours depending on my schedule for real life events the next day this may vary however mostly staying on par edit as far as a specific order i throw balls at everything cherries at everything yellow or deeper in color and minimum blue balls from orange to red circles and blow through potions from lowest hp first
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,berries and balls i need all the potions because gym battle is what i do most of the time also balls and barries have the highest drop rates and its much easier to grind for balls than for potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this depends on what i am doing that day some days i am catching pokemon others might be a gym battle marathon others might just be stocking up on supplies i used to throw away a lot of potions because i never did gym battles but im level now and battle gyms everyday so i can go through potionsrevives a lot to answer your question though the last time my bag was full after doing a pokestop run through town i found myself throwing out to pokeballs if i knew to stops were coming up and i was getting close potions can be scrapped too if needed up until recently i used to throw out revives here and there but now i find myself running out of them quite a bit i dont ever recall throwing out anything but these items regardless of what level ive ever been in the game only exception is pre level i used to throw out super potions along with my potions and revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if im in a peaceful phase a lot of catching and little fighting i get rid of potions and sometimes super potions if i have at least hypermax potions if im in a warlike phase a lot of fighting little catching i throw away pokéballs in order to get below total balls i never throw away revives hypermax potions which are the same because i have no chansey great balls ultra balls and razz berries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get a lot of revives and lower level potions i have upgraded my bag because i am still hoping to get a pokemon go and saving about balls i can carry a thousand items but i hover around
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion super potion revive hyper potion i have pokemon reachable from the house but no pokestops so if i stay home over a weekend i can run out of them easily so small potions go first for obvious reasons then revives because i am pretty set in the gyms at worst i drop down to holding gyms so i never really need more than revives per day except for accidents when training since most my high cp mons are holding gyms i dont need to be very offensive so the big potions are stacking up too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,delete pokeballs and go battle a gym and use all the weak potions first
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if my bag does get full i just use all the regular potions i have i figure itd be wasteful to throw them away why not heal my pokemon yknow i hit gyms everyday at school so most of them are ready to fight or be dropped
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,normal potions cos i get tonnes and they are useless then pokeballz cos i have loads then raspberrys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i delete berries till down to revives till at then purple potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,regular pokeballs revives down to then but never below razz berries down to then but never below regular potions i have never in my levels of playing deleted a max revive a max potion a super potion a hyper potion a super ball or an ultra ball i cant imagine any justification for doing it i do a lot of gym training and most of the time you dont get to choose who you train against which means experimentation and inevitably taking a fair amount of damage as you shoot for max prestige the potions are more valuable to me than an ultra ball or anything else i can get from a pokestop and the chances of replacing a good potion with a better one are too slim to be worth pursuing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i throw away anything above pokégreatultra balls razz potions i am sitting at super and hyper potions and around revives because my brother wants to go gym farming at night since weeks and he never manages to find the time he rather gets high at the moment getting gym after gym with him at night with bikes was such a great fun but i already feared it wouldnt last that long so i will probably lower my caps for superhyper potions and revives soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion revive super potion the only ones ive ever binned more pokemon than pokestops here revives are less frequently recently but still averaging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i only get rid of pokeballs and razzberries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions and revives i dont fight gyms im still just trying to fill my pokedex so theyre worthless to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the weaker potions and revives are usually first to go especially revives since i always end up with way more than ill ever need i hardly battle at gyms but catch pokemon all the time so i have never thrown out any balls berries i used to throw out rarely in the beginning but dont anymore might as well use them instead of chucking them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i play the game mostly for collecting and once in a while for gyms so i keep a couple of hyper potions and revives and otherwise stock up on balls and berries as much as possible ive run other of balls before because there are so few stops around me and i want to be able to keep playing in rural areas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep potions and revives im not sure why if i go after a gym once a week its a miracle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my answer coins dat bag space real answer my drop order is berriespotionssuper potionsrevivespokeballs i rarely get past berriespotions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep normal potions then of the other potions and revives berries then everything else is pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nothing pogo uses a ton of pokeballs and if i start to fill up i just swing by a level gym take it down using the recommended six pokémon each time get the xp for battling the gym then use revives and potions starting with the smallest working up takes a bit more time but getting xp for items seems better than just throwing them out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when i stock up about once a week my bag hold items i keep them limited to about potions super potions hyper potions max potions i dont toss them i use them to get rid of them revives berries the rest are balls if im down to the above limits and my bag is full then ill start tossing pokeballs to make more room for more great and ultra balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,berries i only use them when needed and have constantly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion super potion revive hyper potion berry i live in a small town without any gyms and pokestops so i basically dont need medicine i would never think of throwing away a ball this will probably change because im moving to a bigger town now looking to finally reach coins to upgrade my bag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i try to keep revives and berries first i delete revives down to i never delete berries but over am a lot more liberal with their use then i go down the list of potions i never delete balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get rid of all my potions aside from max potions first and then i get rid of all revives apart from then i get rid of all razz berries and pokeballs until i have of each my bag capacity is at my reasons for this are that i dont ever touch gyms im simply to weak to make a dent in any of the gyms in my area which are all team mystic level gyms i have no snorlax or lapras or dragonite to tackle them with so those few max potions and revives are just in reserve for in case i pass by a level gym the last time i actually battled a gym was like weeks ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions then revives i never transferred a single pokeball ever i run out way too quick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i leave enough best potions and revives to last me fighting gyms the next time after that i dump pokeballs so that theres a chance of getting great balls and ultra balls if it gives you shitty potions just throw them away and try the next pokestop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,berries and potions in order of weakest to strongest will never ever throw away a pokeball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs im going to find more every stop so always pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions and revives personally i rarely do gym battles no point in doing them when their dominated by level people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potionsrevives because essentially all gyms in sf are botted and battling is a waste of time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,berries because when you have pokeballs ultraballs great balls and berries you realize pretty fast that at a berry per ball ratio you literally cannot use all those berries i do not save more berries than my total number of pokeballs ever it should not even be possible to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it depends on whats going on for me at the moment and what the ratios are in my bag it can change from moment to moment day to day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i delete anything related to healing i dont go to gyms so they are not a necessity to me or my conquest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i delete berries because im never able to use them faster than i acquire them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,potion super potion hyper potion revive max potion max revive razberry i dont care for gym battles dont see the point im sure the max revives and max potions would have a lot of trade value with other players seems such a waste
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i always delete every potion except max and i cut down to the following amounts for others max potion revives razz berry i keep as many max revive poke balls for the plus great balls ultra balls as possible my ultimate bag looks like this when full max potions revives max revives saving as many as possible poke balls currently great balls currently ultra balls currently razz berry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,almost exclusively pokeballs and sometimes revives for greater balls ultra balls and berries i set myself a limit of each as soon as i reach about i start using them way more freely yap then i catch cp rattatas with greater balls and berries until i am back to about as for nonmaxpotions i usually use all of them whenever i can i rarely need to delete them if i have excess potions i usually just train a little bit more to get rid of them max potions i try to keep as soon as it goes above i use them a lot max revives i try to keep that fills my inventory spots
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bag full what a novel concept i think i actually had that happen once when i ventured out of the suburbs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokecoins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i always try to have zero potions zero revives zero pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,red pokéballs almost everything escapes from them beyond level and pokéstops always give the lot of them i live in a city
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed always delete potion super potion hyper potion revives first then berries to load up on more balls once that is done i start deleted regular pokeballs to stock up on more great and hyper balls i only keep about revives and max potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe reconsider gyms at least in my area with fewer people playing gyms have gotten to higher levels with stronger defenders and people have stopped trying to take them down as often ive had two in gyms for about two weeks now in relatively populated areas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seriously berries why not just use them on everything you encounter improves your catch rates and clears your bag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when i start getting close to berries i just use them on every throw instead of tossing them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,defender bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres no reason to ever delete a berry when i get too many i just start tossing them at every high level bird and rat i encounter saves balls and makes room for more balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are no rights answers to my question but this is the right answer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that happened to me as well xd i remember the times when revives were almost useless and i decided to only keep in my bag the next day revive drops went down defenders came back fainted and training could faint your pokémon as well oh god i took almost weeks to restock that xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use a razzy every time i throw a great ball that will solve your problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to think that and threw away berries a month or two ago last night i used berries on one dragonite as a matter of fact i used berries ultra balls great balls regular pokeballs i literally caught him on my last regular ball anyway i dont have tons of berries now starting over from i am back up to berries today i think ill be carrying around more balls going forward i never imagined using that many on one pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im getting so many razz berries that i now use them on every single pokemon i encounter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my pokemon havent been healed in over a month can i have your potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,razzberries potions super potions and normal pokeballs i used to dump revives because they were rarely required that changed and now i hoard them not sure if this is worldwide but where i am ive had difficulty getting revives for the last week and a half and have pretty much stopped taking down gyms by myself as an aside ive noticed a lot more level and gyms than before whereas a gym would rarely last an hour before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe its a west coast thing i do the same i dont battle much in gyms and potionssuperpotions are essentially worthless to me im a collector so i mostly want to increase great and ultraballs and also always want to have a solid stock of razzberries in my bag i try and keep a solid handful of max potions pluks revives just because i keep hearing how rare they are these days and if i ever start battling more often ill want to have a good starting supply
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn this is exactly what i am doing too even with the what number of revives should i keep thing only difference is i have amassed max potions so even hyper potions get tossed now over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also at currently and its amazing how quickly it fills sometimes isnt it ill look through the numbers quickly and nothing looks that high and then ill realize that when youve got items it only takes a few of them being over to start hitting the max pretty quickly i know ill get to eventually
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think people make too much of the revive change just run or switch mons when it looks like youre not going to survive another hit to finish the mon off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the plus has changed my playing habits significantly too i use great balls all the time unless its a green circle since i have tons of great balls my work is a pokéstop and only about regular balls tops and those can get consumed to and from work i had almost berries so i had to dump a bunch of those ill probably regret that if i ever see anything good but that seems unlikely pokedex has been stuck at for weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to throw out all of my pokeballs but after getting the go i now keep around on me i keep my greatballs at around and then however many ultraballs im able to get usually around berries i keep at revives at either or and the rest are potions i used to drop potions and super potions and only keep hyper and max but i realized that when training gyms the reg potions do come in handy sometimes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed that regular pokéballs are my most valuable asset with pogo i go through them constantly and can never have enough luckily i live close to victory memorial parkway in minneapolis which lets me stock up on or so in about minutes since there are many a couple hundred or so pokéstops over a mile i dont know how anybody else stays stocked
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed i burn through revives and potions like no tomorrow but ive never had fewer than regulargreatultra balls ill get rid of regular balls at a time depending on how many stops i plan on hitting in the next hour or so
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whats the most balls youve ever thrown at one pokemon i just had my first epic encounter with a dragonite last night my first dragonite went down in balls the one last night was about balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a flaw in this thinking are you saying if you have hyper potions but only super potions you will throw away the hyper potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,believe me as soon as they would implement item trading every competitive player would have a socalled backpack account niantic knows how this goes from ingress and if they have any common sense they will neverever allow item trading because it will lead to people creating backpack accounts on secondary devices sorry but trading inventory items is one thing we definitely cant have ever and i really hope that niantic will never implement it as for trading pokemon you can at least easily create a system that makes backpack accounts really really easily traceable by noting who caught the pokemon for every pokemon and guess what the account x who has pokemon from player y in his inventory but only a handful alibiselfcaught pokemon is obviously a backpack account so for trading pokemon there is a solution for that problem for trading items there isnt a solution that is worth it so niantic should just never allow trading items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,would be nice to have slots instead of i have like ultra balls great balls and pokeballs when i cap slot limit normally lower amount revives they are really rare now hyperpotions and some razzberries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol ultra balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the gym game in my suburban area completely changed lately as well im in lvl gyms now for over two weeks i drive by occasionally to see if they have been attacked but they are always sitting at full prestige i fear i will never see these pokemon again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the gyms most accessible to me at the ones on campus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,extra clickstime its not much of an advantage and i get a ton of them id always rather have an extra greatultra ball than another berry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats exactly what i do over fifty i use way more of them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,every hours you can collect your defender bonus which gives you stardust and poke coins per defender in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,extra click time is annoying and not convenient i rather have an extra greatultra ball plus nobody knows how much it improves your capture chance in my experience it does not improve it a substantial amount
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,great or ultra
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i watched a random guy use all of his balls on a dragonite too i think he had more than you list here the big difference was he did not catch it with his last ball he literally dropped his phone on the ground afterward and he told his buddy that he had uninstalled the game he sounded serious too as for me it fled after maybe a dozen ultra balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how in the world did that dragonite not ran way mine always run away after ultraballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,surprised he didnt run away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here i am with everything rare running away after one or two balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill keep your experience in mind and up my raz average from to p two nights ago though i couldnt even use before a lapras and a dragonite ran away for me minutes apart p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also went through about ultras great and berries on the first dragonair i ran across for some reason i couldnt reach him with the any of the different pokeballs i only made contact maybe once every throws never had that problem with any other mon before is this normal but i finaly did catch him to bad he was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,omg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe im just lazy but this sounds like a waste of time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh my i cant deal with unhealed mon i dont care if its wasteful all mon must always be healed and my healing screen must always be clean
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i throw away hundreds of hyper potions currently at max potions will likely start throwing away some of them in the future too i dont have that much space for that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get my gyms rewards every day but i dont fight just because fighting i avoid established gyms only fight those change frequently usually to pokemons on it and train those from my team that are established back when i used to have revives i realized how many i threw away and how little i used i dont think i ever go below my limit the extra right now are just in case
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh that is a nice position i havent been able to get over max pots i think but i only have space on my backpack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i heard of the revive change but never noticed it its by far the item i need the least of maybe the change just overlapped with my change in gym strategy mystic dominates the whole area havent seen a strong instinct or valor gym anywhere for weeks so i never bother attacking them anymore i only train up mystic gyms i only need revives when i mess up a charge dodge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the revive change was only a resource issue during a fairly brief period when folks had to rebuild their revive stocks now that i have a base of and collect tons more every day i never come close to running out even when i doing ridiculous amounts of battlingtraining since they heal of damage along with the revive i dont see much advantage to running away early unless im fighting magikarp with my tiny fighters it always seems silly to use a revive and a potion on someone who only has hp to begin with
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep around berries and when you encounter an ultra rare pokemon you have them to use and you can replenish them whenever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my work is a pokéstop im so jelly my work is technically a pokestop but the location of the pokestop far from my desk and is so conspicuous that i dont dare spin it for fear of outing myself as playing pogo at work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not currently no i wish
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ballssee that is obscene it should never take more than like balls for any pokemon i wasted on a snorlax that ran away today and i was pissed off that is how you make me stop playing the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine was a dragonite as well i think it took about ultra balls i have a full living na pokedex so i usually just run away if higher stage evolutions take too long to catch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,holy moly first dragonite was went down with ultras the one last week was and i used up ultras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup i generally only take gym a day since gyms swap quickly in my city so i could technically get rid of of those items i mentioned and still be okay but if i ever want to go on a gym bonanza i have more than enough items to do so i throw away hyper potions and revives all the time since i value pokeballs and berries much more than them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ultra balls are for dragonites and thats stuff but how are you gonna catch a mew you guessed it with a hyper ball the master ball is for mewtwo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea yea whatever lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what happened in the gym near my house was my lapras was the defender with a cp and slowly as the gym got taken down one level and replaced with a stronger pokemon my lapras moved down the ladder until its first now its out of the gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mystic right as an instinct i have yet to see a level gym by my team i live in the biggest city in my country and ive been through the most of it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we need a withdraw option i need my larpas back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ooooh yeah no college kids with too much time on their hands i stay away from those p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i thought ultra and razzy was a given
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats madness mine fled after the ultra ball its so frustrating its the only dragonite i ever saw but all those gyms have dragonites in them all the time thats crazy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonair is pretty far away too far for my curve throws further then a zubat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mostly straight tried some curves too was hitting the ground right at his feet on about of my throws missing left or right maybe mostly hitting inside the circle on the remainder but plenty of outside the circle hits as well never anything better than a great ironically the shot that got him hit him on the chest below the circle with a regular ball no curve no good throw no great throw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well maybe it would be nice to have a button for razz berry in the catch screen itself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cant do this i dont have enough potions i have tons of revives but no potions maybe i need to let my pokemon die more often
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how id say about of my fighters are healed at any given time lol i use max potions basically on a case by case basis for getting defenders ready suburbia ahoy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol me too i once tried taking a gym in which i fainted over pokemon so every time i finally get a revive from a pokestop and see a list of pokemon it makes me cringe its going to take a long time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,during my past couple downtown runs to stock up my bag ive noticed that my formally huge supply of revives is gone in fact as of right now i have zero i never would of thought that possible a month ago i used to have to keep a strategy of how many i would keep on me regularly throwing them out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so why hold onto great balls do you live far away from pokestops and have to save up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah my first was cp this one was cp and cleared my bag i think if it were a it just would have ran and one or two more cp and i might not have caught it on that last ball and it would have made me buy more balls or run ive been using a second phone for gps accuracy issues but in an emergency i could log in on the one with inaccurate gps and buy the balls honestly i was so demoralized at the end of my bag that im not sure if i would have had the presence of mind to think to do it though i might have ran and then been upset later when i realized i had the option
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you shouldnt throw away a hyper before a super though the hyper is better in every way no reason to pitch one unless you have regular and super potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are lucky the players on your team are still active here i level to in a very strong gym next to a busy local shop and no one bothers to put a mon in days then it is slowly going down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,port douglas queensland has a level instinct gym right by my holiday house
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup mystic here for what its worth my wife and i dont attack instinct gyms they are few and far between in my area as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats an epic amount of balls seriously try the curve from full bottom left to full top right of the screen faster and further than you have before basically off your phone and wait until the circle is smallest but dont worry about trying to hit it in the circle also try putting ar on and angling him down the bottom of the screen i only have one data point ultras where i missed the first times finding the range and didnt remember to use a raspberry until mid way through but i dont think it should take that many balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hitting the circles and getting bonuses doesnt change the capture rate just how much xp you get what does change the capture rate is the size of the circle the smaller it is the better so with rare things that keep breaking out of the ball every throw should be when the circle is tiny
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have been known to waste max potions if thats all i got after reviving them just to clear that screen absolutely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you need a place you can go to downtown of a big city that has like pokestops within a mile radius and just go in a loop to get you back up and running your basically puttering along it seems like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because i rarely play anymore but when i do ill go somewhere with way too make pokemon to keep track of i live in la pokestops everywhere i pretty much only play using my pogo these days so i dont really have a use for items in general but im saving up for days when i go mon farming or for future generation releases
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,doesnt make a difference either way as i will never be in a situation where i need even a fraction of the total amount of revives and combined potions on my account at any given point in time i just have a max inventory so i figured i would hold onto a set number of items to a cap so as not to overfill the chunk of my inventory i have reserved for balls it is mainly to just be prepped should they ever release a good gym update i could legit throw away all super potions hyper potions revives and most my max potions and it still would not negatively impact my gameplay is the point i am getting at
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im surrounded by level instinct gyms and i dont live in a heavily populated area of the world
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,those kinds of areas seem to be where team instinct thrive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i picked instinct because when i looked around my area all the gyms were blue except that one yellow gym i wanted the challenge i even met two players in the neighborhood who when i told them i was instinct their response was im so sorry they were valor mystic i snickered valor mystic would have been too easy today the entire neighborhood is painted yellow the gyms are all lvl once in a while a spot opens up and i am able to squeeze a guy in as of last night i have pokes out in the field i live in a smaller city with a population of aprox
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess so i mean i live near pensacola fl not exactly the middle of no where
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have guys out in gyms every night
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,give or take i got bumped out on friday but will be putting some back in today
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you live in a major city
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in a smaller city with a population of aprox
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heres the map i went off of if anyones confused about the region choices
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen my first other chicagoan i was expecting it to be longer before that but i guess with a big city with a huge ingress population at least a few other people were bound to get in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so few in appalachian thats where im at and i sure hope they send out a lot for this area in the next wave
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pacific coast is rocking this survey california up in here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i voted and im not in it ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is why we cant have nice things 😖
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this sounds more like theyre planning for a full release sooner rather than later its a good thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure whats there to be nervous about from this it looks like information on if youre applying for that kind of job unless you are applying for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dronpes should apply for this job
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im getting nervous about not getting an email from testflightniantic c
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh that yeah i am too though either way congratulations to you if you do get it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats but tsr isnt really the right forum for these kinds of posts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good for you i kind of wish id kept mine but didnt all those dudes have low ivs anyway its cool that you had enough decency not to send it off for candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyre all which isnt too bad usually my cutoff for ivs is higher but theyre still better than most wild ones it took me ages to find a good iv squirtle i have a hatched charmander with ivs in the high that im saving for something for now all my candy is going into this guy so i dunno what im doing with the other one i hate to transfer a good iv charmander though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,smoochum is causing magby to shoot fireworks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or smoochum
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man you better charge your phone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyre still walking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,who do you think lit the fireworks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there was no love for charmander or bulbasaur on the last holiday loading screen either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hes fire type so theyre all watching him blow up happy new year
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,magby is the fireworks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no love for smoochum in this post p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,took a while to understand you filthy little poet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,check again youre connection with the server was probably poor
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this also happens to me from time to time for seemingly no reason i might care more if location info was useful or accurate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had this too for about a week both on wifi and on data while my gf still had it yesterday they came back as unexpectedly as they went
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have the same problem for weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i reloaded the game and it still isnt there im connected on with a solid connection check your game and see if its not just me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a shame we cant have the map like we used to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats really strange my game has been acting up all day my go plus hasnt been working properly and now this i had to reinstall the game to fix the go plus issue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did check thats why i said to check again sometime it doesnt display but if i close out of the pokemons info page and bring it back up it usually displays the capture location
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is just speculation but could they possibly include a way to link it to your pokemoncom trainer account i thought i had heard something about that way back when
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,golden tip bro
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is because niantic used to be a part of google so they may not include this in pokemon go now that they are a separate company but its a data point to consider niantic is still using g a lot well google invested several million dollars into the game alongside nintendo and the pokemon company the next point is that niantic is still absolutely dependent on google since without googlemaps data neither ingress nor pokemon go would be possible so its not unlikely that google wants to keep promoting g through pokemon go like they did it through ingress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well to be fair ingress has to be a google account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,out of curiosity for those in the beta who also play ingress did you use the same email account you used on ingress are there any advantagesdisadvantages one way or the other as far as you can tell i want to use a different gmail account for go instead of what i chose for ingress so i was just wondering
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you use those workarounds in the links above dont forget to have your mail forwarded to your gmail
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats what the beta has
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,these are good points
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there have been plenty of people who have had this issue most recently which is what prompted me to post this here i think you can use whatever account you are signed into on your phone its been ages since i signed up though so i dont remember the process all i really know is that its a known issue in ingress that might also pop up with this game since its by the same company id rather people be aware than not you know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for the beta we basically had to use the same email we use for ingress i assume those restrictions will be less for the launch version
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the beta is a different thing when people signed up for that you wanted to use your ingress email so that niantic could see you were an ingress player then those that were picked had to log in using that same email since thats how it knew who to let in to the app for the open launch you could probably use whatever gmail you want to use the only possible downside i could see is if they ever do some kind of crosspromotion thing like giving an ingress badge for joining pogo or a pogo badge for being an ingress player i dont see that as terribly likely though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the beta let you choose to log in using your email or your pokemon trainer account or uh so i heard from a friend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to clarify the pokemon site does have a pokemon go section i am not in the beta so i havent really done anything with it but it is there so hopefully nintendo is coming into modern times with regards to a universal nintendo user account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what if my email for pokemon trainer account email is my gmail i plan to use does it recognize it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you probably saw it in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seeing a pokémon in a gym counts as seen in the pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,saw it in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you all sorry i havent played in a while and feel like a newbie
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pssst maybe delete now that its answered
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe even drove past a gym with the app open
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you do need to click on the gym though i went past a gym with porygon two it for about a week its a cross from my house he was on top and refused to interact with it until i got mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have to click the gym but dont have to scroll to the pokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is this question searchable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,assuming this is a nice troll post screenshot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,happened to mine too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,albino poliwag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill be seeing it in my nightmares
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same as our avatars turning white except for the belt or whatever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,polarwag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im torn between you must keep it just in case there is something unique valuable about it to be discovered later and transfer it now because it doesnt deserve to live its so hideous
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kill it with fire i just instictively see the blue and swirl its almost irritating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a sper nope nvm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to be fair if other poliwags are normal then this could very well be a shiny the fact its devoid of colours means the maskingtexture layer hasnt been applied from what i heard about the shinies theyre rumored to have some glitterysparkly effects to them also so itd mean something messed up on niantics end which shouldnt come as a surprise if this was indeed a shiny similar to applying texture packsskins incorrectly or clashes with skyrim mods etc obviously youll only know when you catch other poliwags
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,alolan poliwag confirmed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,casper the little ghost
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poliwhite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,glitch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,glitch but funny glitch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,minor text fix incoming
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its just a texture that isnt loading thats all a visual glitch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it looks like beherit in berserk so scary
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does it stay that way if you reset it would be really cool if it was something with that specific mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that would be the lamest shiny ever a pokemon devoid of all colour and detail a silhouette
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the shinys is pokemon go will just look like zhey did in the old games you can actually can find lists for that on the internet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i noticed something rather odd yesterday though not quite as odd as this i was checking the nearby tab and noticed that some of the pokestops were displaying without pokemon once i clicked on them the larger images would appear but when i backed out they were still missing after that i went to my pokemon inventory and noticed that a few of my pokemon were missing from there too just the artwork though there was still a space for the with cp etc and i could still click on them and go to their page but i couldnt see the pokemon themselves i concluded that it was a graphical issue and assumed it was my phone i had been running the game without a restart for about hours assuming these things are connected it looks like it wasnt my phone after all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kill me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a shiny poliwag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so any updates check pokedex put in gym anything really
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its devoid of color how is that shiny
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,clan poliwag lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its actually alolan poliwag ice type instead of water type and evolves up into either icefighting poliwrath or icefairy politoed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kill me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but it stayed that way including in storage ive never seen anything like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at first glance i thought that it was in the realm of possibility that this was how niantic chose to implement the shiny mechanic it look the same in storage as well but theres nothing else special about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can i see a pic that sounds amazing 😃 if youre being honest then that must be like the glitch pokémon in gen like missingno
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpimgurcomqlurvsg yeah sure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,missingno was due to random stripes of code working in a way they shouldnt have each effecting another where this is a graphics issues like when you press the home key and your avatar turns white
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats really neat seems like theres a problem in the coding of that individual pokémon itself unfortunately it probably wont stay that way for long but id definitely favorite it and keep it unevolved just for how cool it is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its weight is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,put it in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,name him snowball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you have other poliwag it looks like your phone has lost the graphic for it but if it only happens for one poliwag and not others then im stumped
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well check pokedex first then this and ask anyone you know to check the gym and see if its either missing regular texture or missing shiny texture
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont unfortunately ill see if i can catch one asap whirl and wrath are normal fwiw but i suspect youre right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh man i didnt even consider that what is this is a shiny that somehow made it through early before the mechanics behind it could be added
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the other way to test this would be to uninstall and reinstall the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,show pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tbh with all how buggy its been lately id be too scared to do this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe when you get a speed softban you also reset the counter but im not sure because when i drive for with the bus i always get the pokestop bonus and its in between quite fast i think the distance might be in a similar range but there are no big gaps in they way maybe if the gap is too large you reset the counter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as long as you get the stops at least nine min apart it can be over no speed reset or catching mon reset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have to get all unique stops inside of minutes ive gotten the bonus while driving so i dont think speed effects it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my drive from the first two pokestops to the rest is about nine minutes so i think you are on to something there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,read httppokemongogamepressgg bro not trying to be rude but this isnt a qa forum
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,multiplier to catch rate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are a variety of catch bonuses bonuses for having medals for the pokémon type you are catching different throw bonuses increased catch odds for using razz berries or better poke balls what exactly are you looking at
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am pretty certain hes trolling its becoming less and less subtle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is it not meant to help other players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it can also help new players to get more people to get playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when we get the medals
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this forum is for research
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would and have pointed new players to gamepress it has great research is easy to read and is well known among the community im really not trying to be negative but one line question probably arent going to help more than one or two people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre not accomplishing that by any stretch of the imagination
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gamepressgg has really good descriptions of the various catch bonuses short answer is that you get a slight increase in catch rates for having medals related to the type of pokémon you are trying to catch something like for bronze for silver and for gold for a pokémon with a small catch rate like dragonite for example that is a big benefit for most pokémon it helps but not by a huge amount on the other hand every little bit helps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but would it be terrible to help other people too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but also to help new players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was that comment to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they can ask on rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just scrolled through the past hours of activity on this site its about questions announcements research related posts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,okay and still against rules
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,okay and what happens when theres no research h to be done
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,please go back to rpokemongo this forum is not for discussion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fabulous
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hard to see the purpleblue arrow on my pointer finger but here are my pokemon go inspired nails i used holo glitter on the poke balls to imitate the flashing on the go plus when you catch a pokemon and the arrows are done in team colors
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry but the only thing remotely pokemon about these nails are the pokeballs not too sure if i would look at those and go pokemon go without the explanation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the glitter was meant to look like the rainbow flashing of the go plus light when you catch a pokemon its hard to see in this light but the arrows are a gradient of the three team colors i did the arrows as a nod at continuing to move when the game is released every part of it was meant to be inspired by pokemon go i even put the decription in the comments earlier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ye i meant if it wasnt for that description i wouldnt have guessed pokemon go specifically love the pokeballs btw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds like bs to me a somewhat more plausible theory would be spawn locationfrequency correlates with app activity so you wouldnt get a new spawn just by making an account youd need to see activity from multiple accounts over a large period of time a month in order to get more spawns in an area not to mention that the global spawn rate increased with the last patch muddying their data even further
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,those arent even his pictures they are stolen from reddit if his supposed theory worked he would have his own screenshots to back it up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have been told that spawn rate is based on the historical volume of cellular activity plus the amount of pokéstops nearby if you play ingress it should be visible as the amount of xm on the ground
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spawn points have a correspondence seemingly less so after the recent spawn point updates with ingress xm ingress xm is said to be generated based on cell activity data from or years ago so this article is speculation contrary to the communitys current understanding of spawn mechanics
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am quite sure that not even a bit truth is in this even heard of those map scanner guys creating tons of ptc accounts for their scanning i guess most of them dont care for location so they just enter one and each account gets created at that geolocation that means those places should have hundreds of spawns right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as of the last update people have reported that places that used to have no spawns because they didnt exist in so no cell dataxm now have spawns so it seems like niantic is transitioning to a more uptodate spawn map
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no one here knows if there will be a st pats event and if so what it will be like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im saving mine for the next event banking on easter more you might want to consider hatching one of them so that you can continue to gethatch eggs in your infinite incubator until then if youre going to wait
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,use infinite incubator on one save rest for next event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,come on you are not seriously considering waiting for the next event and not hatching any eggs with your orange incubator until then hatch at least one and keep your orange incubator running with the eggs you get
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if they didnt do a candy bonus for pokémon day i doubt well see a double candy for st pattys my bets are on easter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,paddy not patty fyi
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first of all there is no such thing as pattys day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does there really have to be a comment like this every time someone brings up st patricks day op like the rest suggested just hatch one so you can at least hatch or in the infinit incubator that way if there isnt an event you would still be getting xpdust
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,would you like if we started referring to independence day as independix day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that wouldnt bother me in the least why should it matter how they spell it you still understand what theyre saying i think you should take offense that the holiday itself is just an excuse to drink alcohol and represents the irish in that way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and what about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess its your problem if you mind one but not the other then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually its a general annoyance here in ireland after all its our day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh noits retarded
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpimgurcomaxmwar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also got a squirtle seems like the most common dont really care because i have a wartortle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what website is that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its silph roads iv rater httpsthesilphroadcomresearch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,while we obviously arent certain that does seem to be the implication and current line of thought
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,use of bluetooth to establish a connection would make sense in the main games they use ir to significantly speed up establishing a direct wireless connection nfc would be really good for equipped devices has apple adopted that yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,considering people are hatching eggs by riding bikes i would hardly consider the trailer a source of legitimate information
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but we have almost nothing from the original trailer it is nothing but a concept video
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,while i agree with u it doesnt make sense to have regional specific pokemon and then only have local trading for them bc most of the general public isnt going to be traveling around for them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then most of the general public isnt going to get them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you only have to trade to get it into your pokédex then trade it back on gentlemans agreement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but that would defeat the purpose of gotta catch em all wouldnt you say
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,absolutely not you always had to trade and work hard to collect the full pokedex cmon man its doable if they implement local trading and only those who try hard will complete their pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,like i said before i agree with this notion and at the same time i dont well just have to see rumors have been going around that its going to be implemented sometime in october
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice thanks for sharing that the latest large apk update added a lot of code that may point to a navigation function coming soon but it seems directly related to the go device so it may require the bluetooth device they have recently added the ability to select one of the nearby pokemon which places it in the nearby section alone now but no other ui is added to assist in navigation at this point either way great to have a visual on where the mons could be spawning at their known distances
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry if this has been covered but is this a tool in the vanilla pogo app or is it something else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive tried that selection and i didnt notice it updating unless i brought up the full list again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a one of the very first pics niantic themselves gave us the op was using it so no nda would be broken
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes thats been a bug others have seen too it apparently freezes the distance when you select one mon from nearby looks like that feature is still in development
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no worries i always appreciate others looking out for beta testers if stuff like that happens
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when i read the blue link i was thinking how great would it be if this was venture bros and then you made my day i yell this at my ex like all the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,already posted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my strat is to simply build a team that is half the cp of most of the defenders if there is one exceptionally weak mon at the bottom i ignore it if there are several low cp i build to defeat just them only and then retreat when i hit a high cp mon nothing worse than having a lowcp snorlax at the bottom of the gym though thats like a teamkill
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do something similar but my naming convention is simpler basically everyone in the cp team has as the start of their name everyone on the cp team starts with then i add an abbreviation of their moveset so a cp wiggly tuff with pound and hyperbeam would be po hyper a cp golduck with water gun and hydropump would be wghydro when its time to prestige just sort by name and the teams will all be up top sorted into teams by cp range number
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,great explanation i run a similar set up using symbols so when i sort by name they go to the top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a great idea to make prestige teams built around a leader who represents the cp cap of the team i like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,very similar to my approach main differences i never power up prestigers unless im swimming in stardust i evolve directly to the appropriate cp range i name my prestigers according to their cp team so is my parasect in the range is my venomoth with bug moves in the range and so on when i approach a gym i sort by name and favorite the candidates for battling then i sort by favorite bonus after prestiging the main defenders highest cp are just below the favorites my cp ranges are and period no need for higher cp ranges because they give less prestige per minute
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is amazing thanks so much for taking the time to write this out im going through pokemons tonight to sort them into teams
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just battle with whatever the game suggests
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not to knock ya but this was commonly suggested from day one after prestiging changed p tbh you only need two prestige teams though and covers all your needs being at exactly half of the enemy cp isnt necessary for efficiency but if you are juat looking for things to do building more than two prestige teams is good busy work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im about to get to level hopefully this year and i will start using this so i will set a remindme day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have found that hatched pokemon when evolved and left alone fit into the prestiging range almost perfectly usually depending on the mon these guys make up a majority of my prestige team because they are commonly strong attackers due to being hatches i prioritize based on moveset preference too that starmie end up with tackle and psychic to the grinder he goes water gun and pump time to compare him against my other water prestigers to see if he is worth keeping
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im figuring out my own little naming system using emojis that will actually show in game for me on my phone this is mainly because an emoji takes up one character and on top of that ill put the quick move type emoji on the left the name or iv if need be and then the ending emoji is the charge move type for example ☃️cloyster☃️ tells me its a cloyster with dual ice moves if its ☃️cloyster⛈️ or ⛴️ undecided i know it has icewater attacks if it can have multiple water or ice moves i may add an ✖️ at end for not best moves or ✔️ for best moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im doing a similar thing but since cp is the current cap i build legions from cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i search the gym and star everything i plan on using unstar everything im not using easy to heal and select quicky my to pidgeots usually stay starred my low jolts too due to gyarados popularity my wiggly tuff get used often as well i only use the star for prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had this then they changed the cp formula and made it impossible to hold gyms so i dont bother anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you say level is exactly what it sounds like but you got numbers higher than in your picture so i assume you count the half levels so thats not exactly what it sounds like p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,trained a gym with a cp chansey followed by a cp snorlax worst of my life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep thats pretty much the same thing i do i ignore low level stuff at the bottom and bail out ifwhen theres a big jump in cp midlineup
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do basically the same thing just build a team on the spot based on whats in front of me im trying to build a living dex and i also catch just about everything i come across so i have loads of pokemon spanning basically the entire cp spectrum onhand all the time it may not be quite as optimized as ops system but its been working well for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,better than a cp chansey i hate those
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can use wigglytuff to train against snax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh i hadnt thought of that sorting by alpha instead of favorites would work very well good idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this was commonly suggested from day one after prestiging changed p was it i definitely missed that then i figured i couldnt be the first person to come up with this idea nbsp being at exactly half of the enemy cp isnt necessary for efficiency oh i dont go for exactly half i just sort of gut feel it based on what im fighting i generally try to go for short of the lowest mon in the gym nbsp but if you are juat looking for things to do building more than two prestige teams is good busy work ill be honest busy work like this brings me a lot of enjoyment in games fight dragons in skyrim nah ill pick flowers and collect bugs for a week first to make some potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of days to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i prefer to focus on getting defenders into established gyms whenever possible i often find myself battling lineups where the lowest defender is reliably taking down defenders of that level with attackers is a pain
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why does changing the cp formula make it impossible to hold gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats right so favorites will always be highest cp and since it would take pages to scroll down i come up with the symbols and name sorting as a solution to easily access my prestigers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i meant that they did two things they changed the cp formula which ruined my prestiging team and they made attacking gyms much much easier making it impossible to keep gyms sorry for being unclear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still spawning theyre a permanent addition and well probably be seeing shiny versions of more pokemon soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it continues
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awesome thanks guys for some reason i couldnt find anything difintive in my searches
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if niantic gets identical or nearly identical reports theyre more likely to ban the reporter than the reportee thats obviously suspicious
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we have no evidence of anyone ever getting banned for reports even if legit you have nothing to worry about
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i doubt niantic would ever ban somebody based on user reports alone i think reports just help flag accounts for investigation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea but most likely only them selves reports only flag the accounts for review if the account has done something worthy of being banned its possible they will be however if its found out that the accounts reporting are all the same person most likely they will be banned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why would they be coming from the same ip he is using some sort of proxy service for all the scanning accounts he would be smart to use it for reporting also
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is no real way of knowing how this would work no one knows how this works but niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one would hope
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think youre missing the reason why pokevision is down niantic is combatting against these maps since they use gos api and query the server directly putting extra strain on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how exactly is my post indicating that im missing the reason why pokevision is down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also because niantic is a bunch of dick chuggers theyre putting more effort into getting these sites offline than theyre putting into improving their own game if they fixed the damn tracking system the use of sites like pokevision would significantly drop heck they probably wouldnt have ever really taken off at all if they wouldve just fixed the tracking system niantic is just an extremely shitty company with shitty priorities that truly doesnt give a crap about the people using their product
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is awesome i have the galaxy edge myself but these are glorious and awesome if i wasnt such an android fanboy i would switch just use these
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blush ☯ ᗜ ☯ th thank you menarinchan
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not a challenge its just plain antifun you basically wouldnt even be playing the game if you did this challenge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would severely hamper your xp gains if you only allow one pkmn catch per day dont think too many will do this until they stall out on level gain
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,new challenge dont do this challenge reward actually have fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that is why its a challenge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can add your own rules or modify some of mine if every one agrees on them ill make a pokemon go lets play following these rules
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one possible reason this isnt a part of the database yet just conjecturing here i could be wrong is that theyre still doing research on biomes not a whole lot of defining characteristics are known about them at the moment and adding a database to track biomes before we fully understand them could just cause more of a headache in straightening things out once we know more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the problem is its difficult to identify individual biomes and even harder is defining how large that biomes span is individual spawn points have biomes applied to them so you can find close spawn points with different biomes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly dont shoot me here im wondering if biomes are too simplistic for the actual distribution of species ive been watching data from various sources and i feel like there are not defined biomes that have certain pokemon but that pokemon each have certain ranges they inhabit exclusive of others for example i saw a hotmap likely gained by spoofing that showed dragonites spawn in elevated areas the information i read suggested that lower lying areas had no spawns while higher areas had many also part of my area is supposed to fit all the criteria high uncommon but regular fairy types and ive yet to even see a dragonite on the radar since i started playing on i cant wait to hear what the research team finds its going to be very interesting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id love this capability as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see them all the time in downtown edmonton some of the pokemons that spawn here are clefairy meowth pidgey clefairy rattatas aerodactyl very common actually clefairy again spearow and maybe a few more clefairys lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,start by searching the sub for other relevant posts lots of folks have posted lately in search of hitmonlee you should be able to find a decent amount of info just by searching
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel bad ive stopped catching them because i see at least one a day on my radar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just that he is usually found in desert biomes with a few outliers like bruce lees grave i too seek a hitmonlee to complete my pokedex having biome information on the map would be very helpful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should all i need is hitmonlee and dragonite to complete my north americanpokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait is he really spawning at bruce lees grave or are you fuckin around lol i never heard that before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you search this subreddit youll see a user describing the situation iirc its washington state here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,most of the time during the capture sequence when the pokémon jumps the shadow just reappears when it lands but on occasion there is a circular flash that happens underneath when it lands pictures any ideas as to what this indicates i am not talking about the flash that occurs before it strikes at you pictures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh ive captured too but i just figured it was an interesting graphic to jazz up the jumping nothing special
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,personally ive always just viewed it as the different between them dodging and attacking they both have the same effect but as more of a flavor thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hunter is reaching the supersaiyan stage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,must be ditto
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,remindme hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,flatulence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looks like it represents the grass under the pokemon moving as it jumps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just a thought but could it mean that the pokemon is exhausted and will not jump or attack for a set time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this circle is to represent the weight of the pokémon as xl youre welcome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that was my initial thought too but i noticed that it happens so infrequently i just sat here watching a rattata dont we all and there was jump or attack moves inbetween circular ring landings and then there was and no apparent pattern now it could be that they programmed it to have a lower frequency for no reason at all but i wanted to explore the possibility that it might mean something maybe an attempt right after that will have increased odds of catching it or decreased odds i dont know just speculating and wanted to see what ideas other people had
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of hours to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bonus is for every pokemon of that species you caught
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haunter is nothing but flatulence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,flashtulence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is not just caught a gastly that did have the circle and it was normal size came back to this thread to tell you so and take away the upvote i gave you earlier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since the circle happens with every pokemon if you wait long enough im going to say no this isnt it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is this a fact or speculation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fair enough i just noticed it made my assumption and basically ignored it after that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,funny all my santachu are male my only party pikachu is female
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only the female pikachus like to party
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine is male
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have both male and female party pikachu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have both caught slightly more female though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok cool im gonna delete this post now just was curious its quite the coincidence then lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,girls just wana have fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree completely i have a ninetales that i literally have not the slightest idea where i left it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds like it would be cool maybe one day when i last longer than mins in a gym it would even come in handy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just join instinct you wont have that problem here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my pokemon stay in gymns less than minutes i live in london and am on team instinct i wish i had this problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i stopped at a level gym yesterday that was from level and started powering up got it to and realized i couldnt put a guy in i thought maybe someone sniped it so i started the haul to level finally reached it and and still couldnt put a guy in thats when i started going through the mons in the gym and realized my poliwrath from days ago was already in itoops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,be nice to know when and if your pokemon won a battle and you should get exp for that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,would absolutely love this idea recently every time i put a pokemon in a gym i collect the rewards right away for my daily bonus because i dont expect them to last long enough to take over other gyms however today i left my arcanine at a gym and hours later it is still there the gym was level and had venusaur snorlax arcaninemine and vaporeon when i left the gym which makes me wonder how strong this gym really is going to visit again tomorrow and check up on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think it would be cool if when i pull up a pokemons data sheet i could click on the flag that signifies that its in a gym and get the gym display the same one you get when you click on a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats why every time i put a pokemon in a gym i make a screenshot had my first snorlax gone missing for weeks and didnt have a clue where he was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i assume its the player drop and possibly the baning of cheaters but lately i have been seeing waaaaay more cp pokemon guarding gyms and different ones too instead of snorlaxs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i never know where my arcanines are and at this point im afraid to ask
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gym status should be off limits too much information for people who monitor gymsand i say that as someone who currently has creatures in level gyms or higher so thats something that would definitely benefit me creature gym locations though i think is a good idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i too agree but be happy its out putting in work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in addition or instead when your pokemon gets knocked out of a gym there should be a way to know what gym they were kicked out of perhaps there should be a gym summary page similar to the journal each time one of your pokemon is placed in a gym it creates an entry with details when a pokemon is knocked out of a gym they get a second entry or the entry jumps to the top of the list
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youre complaining about having too many pokemon in gymsyou need to stop complaining yes some extra information would be nicebut i think its pretty clear the idea is for gyms to be taken over and changing often if you had too much info about your gyms at your fingertips it would put the balance in favor of gym holders being able to monitor the status without being there in person just isnt fair if you dont want pokemon in gyms dont put pokemon in gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my average gym retention is a bit over a week that means on average i dont recall where most of my defenders are at any given time id really like to see this implemented
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they should just start to adopt even more from ingress there you have an overview over all the portals gyms you are in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed but probably the idea was to ensure you visit the gym even after assigning your món they want you to move around to monitor and not do it remotely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,getting a notification when the gym is under attack or something would be awesome and make active defense more viable without having to camp it all day and night which i assume was the intent of it in the first place or at least a way to see a list of all gyms you occupy their prestige levels and general levels so you can tell if its under attack or not me and my group want to try and hold a three gym cluster for a week like we held one but that required three of our team living within sight of the gym and checking it frequently just this addition might spur some more group coordination to hold territory for starters and make the gym system more engaging and fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for the love of god yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gym question do you get higher bonus in coinsdust if you hold multiple gyms at once if so how does it work if you capture one can you collect additional loot once capture or will timer apply and you have to wait to capture them all before you collect
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive got into the habit of renaming the pokemon when i place them in gyms it helps me figure out which stay in gyms for longer but i agree it would be better for the app to tell you these things and to be able to see the current status of the gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,clicking on the gym icon on a pokemon should open up the window as if you tapped on that gym on the world map plain and simple solution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i can see the use but the game is meant to be augmented reality niantic wants people to go out in that reality and investigate things i actually think it is very strange that you are able to access the shop from anywhere the shop should be out there exactly like pokestops forcing you to get to the shop physically but i guess niantic got softgreedy and defined it as an online shop with instant delivery
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i disagree this game is made as a real map interaction game if you are not there you are not supposed to know what happen there for example you are not supposed to know if there are any pokemon spawn far far away imagine you are a gym leader like in the cartoon you need to be there to know the status of your gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its far from ideal but ive accepted the possibility that any one of my gym defenders could theoretically be lost forever i do know where most of them are and can check on the gyms but every time i do i see that the gym is either unchanged or has gone up my only steel wing dragonite who i would love to power up has been sitting down the street from my house for a couple of weeks now i dropped him into one of the most contested gyms in the area thinking id have him back in no more than hours and as little as minutes i worry that as interaction with the game drops over time we will end up essentially losing our monsters unless niantic implements some way to retrieve them or a time limit days or so before they are automatically kicked out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i like the idea i also like the idea of being able to see the other pokemon in the gym or get a message that my gym is under attack so i can defend it and what would be really cool is that you get a message someone is attacking the gym and you can fight for yourself instead of the ai or take over the fight if ai already started to not delay the attacker of course if you do not respond the ai takes over but this will probably cost too much data or maybe that you can give a strategy of the sequence of the attacks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just change the nickname of the pokemon to place if i expect it to last longer sort by name and gym defenders are at the top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the sad thing is you probably want to put it back after its finally returned and you wont know where that gem of a gym is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have an army of vaporeons i never remember who is where
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a lost little lapras out there somewhere kicker is i snapshot gyms when i place out of my area but this gym description is just two bear bench which can be anywhere in a mile range between my parents place and mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so true it hurts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,being an instinct living in the city or really anywhere having multiple gyms for longer than a few hours is the most impossible feat imaginable for me i have never lost track of my pokemon this game is such bullshit when it comes to trying to keep a gym yellow for hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,been there done that super frustrating until i realized what was going on too i thought id discovered some whole new flavor of glitch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hah i did that multiple times until i started renaming my pokémon based upon their gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,itd be really interesting to see what gyms last how long not just from an academic perspective but also to see where i should go to harvest coins it might have the effect of drawing people to lesser played gyms and spreading them out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,would be great if the position of the gym icon also moves up and down the cp arc to show the current gym level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perfect way to implement this i think doesnt use up any ui space that isnt already taken
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not a bad thing i would love to leave my creatures in a gym and never have them come back that means theyre earning you pokecoins and you dont have to go back and open a slot or take down an enemy gym which translates to saved potionsrevives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is the best current solution but its a bit of a hassle to have to juggle through screenshots and then delete the ones that get knocked out etc etc ill do it this way for now but definitely hope they come up with something better in the future
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i woke up on gyms for the first time today lets not make this easier niantic doesnt want a few people running an entire citys gym game thats why you cant see if you are on more than
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in addition
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this would be useful since you cant do anything about a pokemon stuck in a gym the location of them would be useless information but this one has done utility do you know you can go back and retake the gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well then the idea of gyms is wrong it should be more balanced or they shold hurry up and give us pvp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you had too much info about your gyms at your fingertips it would put the balance in favor of gym holders being able to monitor the status without being there in person just isnt fair bingo im currently in gyms that are level or higher and im totally against this feature it would greatly benefit me because i could check up on the gym hp and status then go and do some upkeep if its been attacked or go defend it if its being attacked this aspect of ops suggestion iswellop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would have been easier to do that why do you think they chose not to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can only collect once every hours if you can hold a few gyms at a time only collect once you dont think you can get additional gyms for instance i bike to work and pass by over gyms i grab as many as i have time to and then collect my reward this morning was gyms and i had only leftover gym from yesterday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as someone who is in a team that dominates at least gyms in a radius this would absolutely destroy the balance of the game other team members would never stand a chance any time a gym is under attack or has been attacked at least one person who is invested in that gym will just go over to it and build up its prestige again heck i can monitor gyms from my house and every time its under attack or it gets taken down its immediately flipped again in favor of my team by either me or someone else and at least creatures get added by the end of the day or the beginning of the next day its back to level or higher personally if im around a gym that im holding ill buff its prestige up at least levels to make sure i dont have to waste revivespotions and go back to open up a slot and add my creature later on its worth it to me in time resources both ingame and real world and energy so you better believe im not gonna watch it go down without a fight
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed said so myself in another post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea limit their main source of income to certain areas man i was going to spend on coins but my car doesnt work s
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no thats a horrible idea a lot of rural towns barely have stops and gyms let alone running out of pokeballs and having to walk a mile just to buy more just to try and finish catching the thing youre after
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a company interested in making money niantic was never going to make the ingame shop inaccessible at any point during play i get what you mean about the ingame concept but it would be absolutely insane as a business strategy wanting to make money isnt greedy its what companies are created to do
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at minimum i should know where my mon is and how long its been there i put it there in the first place and its not dead so i should still know when and where
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,losing our monsters literally wtf the point of pokemon is to hold gyms having a pokemon in a gym forever is the ideal situation what else are you going to do with it attack another gym why so you can put a monster there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is basically the definition of a first world problem are you actually complaining that you have had a pokemon hold down a gym for that long that is awesome you should be grateful my dream is to have about gyms passively earning me coins every day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a life expectancy of less than one day on my best spot xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly or even to be able to go train the gym more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a very new functionality in those devices called smart phones that functionality itself is called screenshot it takes around seconds to perform said functionality it also remembers at which date and time you used said functionality use the functionalities of your smart phones edit the down votes this post was meant as an advice about how you can keep track of your pokemon in gyms with much less effort than writing where it is you see the name of the gym and a picture of the gym this will help you remember where it was you will also see the name pokemon and the cp of your pokemon i guess i did formulate my response a litte to much stating obvious stuff you already know but did not think about btw you dont have to do this it is entirely up to you there is no wrong way to play this game play it the way you like to play it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,would also be intuitive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for a little while sure but after a few weeks you start to miss them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah unless you decide you would like to power it up a bit my current record holds a cp clefable that has been in a certain remote hidden gym in a forest for weeks already
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i spent minutes prestiging a gym about a dozen potions to level no other valors came by in that time so it was a sitting duck with one flareon and open spots some mystic kid illegally parks runs over and starts bashing it down to before leaving in the span of minutes i could not prestige it faster than he could take it downso
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,doesnt have to show current prestige or level just which gym and how many if any battles it has survived
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and is it an additional coins per gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the info you mentioned is okay but i just disagree with showing who else in the gym or the level of the gym etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah thats basically my train of thought when i say ive accepted it i find arcanine to be a relatively poor attacker for me for example but he seems to hold gyms quite well i do however wish that my best one wasnt in a boy scouts of america office literally miles from civilization lol but i agree with you if theyre stuck in a gym great free coins until you get or of them stuck in gyms or something you wanted to power up more to show off or your best attacker cause you dropped it in by accident in a hurry also whenif pvp battling andor training comes it could be an issue for the time the fun is holding a gym but if you ended up holding all the gyms in your area for months without ever getting kicked out it would get quite boring and thered be little motivation to take more gyms which i guess is to say that my real worry is that this game depends a bit too heavily on extreme levels of user interaction to function properly and if the player base drops to that of an average game it could theoretically become unplayable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well to answer your question no i am not complaining about it im engaging in a discussion about pokemon weve misplaced at forgotten gyms and added an anecdote about them possibly being stuck there forever i struggle to understand why so many people want to hold gyms without attacking hatch eggs without walking and catch pokemon and level up without leaving their house it essentially sounds like not wanting to play the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah lol who can defend anything anywhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for me its more like hour at best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have pokemon stuck in gyms right now and i only know where one is it is a disappointing feeling to find a goldmine and not be able to find where you encountered it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nothing says im in control like a camera roll filled with random mons in gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its meant to be a casual game the responsibility of tracking defenders should not be put on the player that being said im going to start screenshotting from now on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a start but it doesnt reflect how the gym changes people wanna see if its close to being taken down so they can go train it or if its being trained up and fortified
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and going through the list and deleting every kicked out poke
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know its just my opinion but i have a lapras that i hatched days ago and went home to put in a gym that i havent seen ever since never even attacked with it once i hope he stays there for eternity if you have a creature that you want out of a gym post on your citys pokemongo subreddit and advertise the gym there was a valor gym in my area with prestige for over a month and thats what i did a few days later the gym had flipped in favor of my team its actually the gym that my lapras is in now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for what if theyre in a gym for a long timethats a good thing i wish the defenders i have in a gym right now would never come back to me leave them there so i can click on the collect button every hours for as long as my pogo career lasts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but how you cant remove pokemon currently in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that kid is doing it right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah im in agreement with that heres the quote from which you responded to keywords being this aspect this aspect of ops suggestion iswellop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes each gym will get you coins when you click the blue shield icon in the shop just remember once you click it it goes on a cooldown process so if you had gyms and clicked it youll get coins and dust not sure how much dust and itll go on cooldown if you by any chance take over another gym while its still on cooldown youll have to wait for it until you can claim your prize again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup gyms coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not sure why your original comment is being downvoted but i upvoted it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can only cash in gyms at a time ive had gyms shop screen only showed if youve permanently got more than that in gyms youd literally have no reason to attack unless you were desperate for the xp even then unless your area is barren you can probably get xp quicker by hitting all the pokestops in your most pokestop dense area if your area is that barren you probably dont have the potions for gym work either gyms are for pokecoins and stardust id be over the moon if i could cash in every day for maximum gain and literally zero work ive a couple of mon embedded in some local level towers and its fantastic although i admit i usually put high cp lower tiered pokemon eg slowbro victreebell gyarados etc into something that looks of it might form a tower and keep my a team for smash and grabs that im only trying to hold until i can cash in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its the one advantage that rural players have
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah for sure and i go alot of random places if i check the game and see a friendly gym ill train it upl and drop something or ill take the gym and do the same
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you want to keep some track this is the most effortless way to do it you dont have to keep track though play the game how you want to play it im just showing a good way for now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this works if you can remember where the gympokemon is but currently there is no way of finding out without either remembering or physically traveling around searching for the gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well lets say you didnt know better and you put a rare pokemon with an offensive move set in a gym but you would like to power it up and use it for attacking now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that kid is doomed when i unleash my fearsome diglett on that gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youve permanently got more than that in gyms youd literally have no reason to attack unless you were desperate for the xp or you know if you enjoy playing the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree with the suggestion about knowing which gym your creature is located in i just dont like the suggestion about knowing the gym status thats too much information and i say that as someone who monitors gyms and has creatures currently defending at the moment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what are the odds that you have a rare pokemon no attackers and dont know any better the rare pokemons snorlax lapras dragonite make for far better defenders due to their ridiculously high cps theyre usually gym leaders or top in the gym ladder also attacking in this game is the easy part you can wax any of the best defenders while being several hundred cp lower using type advantage and dodge some of the best attackers are also very common thanks to eeevee you can also use attackers so you dont even need a great creature this game heavily favors attackers both in terms of gym mechanics and creature attributes most creatures are likely to make for a better attacker than they are to make for a better defender i dunno i guess its a difference of opinion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i must admit i utterly detest the whole gym fighting thing and consider it an odious chore that has to be tolerated if i want pokecoins because i refuse to give niantic money i dont really understand why anyone would enjoy such simplistic gameplay but horses for courses i suppose
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well it happened to me and currently i would love to get back my only lapras with frost breathice beam simply because i dont have anything to attack dragonites with i have a single universal attacker snorlax with lickhyper beam and i have to use him for exeggutors too because all my arcanines are useless bulldoze even all my slowbros have pathetic movesets and i cant do anything with them eiher
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,love it or hate it its at least half of the game ¯ ツ ¯
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,personally ive never used lapras to attack dragonite even though he has type advantage because i never had a lapras until recently and i dropped it in a gym the first day i got it without ever even using it to attack its still in the gym nor have i used arcaninefire to attack exeggutor and i wreck both of them thats not me bragging eitherattacking is the easy part in this game you can beat any defender several hundred cp better than you using type advantage and dodge regardless if you want your creature back i can understand that if you know what gym its in go to your local subreddit or your teams subreddit and advertise it for someone who has a group of friends to take it down worked for me on a valor gym that was up for a month or at least i think it was because of that who knows for certain
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you notice that gen pokémon are now spawning in the wild
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait are you serious
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,op isent crazy just not being specific enough it seems as though some of the styles have had their textures changed a bit not new items but still a new look last week i had to choose between black pants and slightly different black pants now those black pants are sweatpants with a pokeball on it and the other pants now have stripes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,everyone its old news
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,someone get op an ice heal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,burn heal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it was in the update notes of course people know of it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had ice berry in my head whoops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this has already been tested and proven the contents of an egg are decided at the time you get the egg one of the biggest ways this was proven was that eggs from before a moveset change were able to hatch with legacy movesets
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since its already been proven to be predetermined lemme know what eggs you have so i can guess what theyll be anyways p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and regionals hatching outside their region because the eggs were picked up in their region
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,beta tester here were still not on biomes but that being said ive found jynxes in suburbia what is truly goddamn fascinating though is that weve noticed a positive correlation between rain and spawning of water types
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no one knows
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,shrug not sure but it might still be hard for someone in guam to find an ice mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats where the fun of the game is working with what we have until we can get around i for one certainly shouldnt spot any ice types in this hot climate id like to think that therell be bountiful fire grass and water types
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no water pokemon for so cal than unless i drive out to the beach i suppose
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yay year droughtwouldnt doubt the ocean starts drying up too p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is the data of the poll that i conducted a few hours ago i asked how everyones pokedex was going and collected this data im not exactly the science type of guy so you can do what you want with this data thanks to everyone who took part in the survey cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,check your bag they may be there even if you didnt see them appear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hit on ios this weekend and got my stuff as usual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had waited around on my level rewards for a while and even continued playing for the night nothing ever popped up until the next day got up and opened pokémon go and the level up screen appeared
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rpokemongoallentown
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they have started
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,check rpokemongo plenty there are saying android sent out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my friend is at my house showing me but wont let me play
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,have you changed your battery they only last about weeks then it seems to get a little glitchy you prob pushed the button more times than you thought
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ya often too i had just changed it hat morning actually
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup its throw hit or miss thats why people say pogo are perfect for first catch bonus maybe this is niantics way of making the game safer by encouraging first catch bonus for pogo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure if this is something confirmed or not but i think nests have off hours where they spawn much slower or not at all our local nest takes a couple hours off during the day and then goes full force at night so its possible that yours has nights off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you will sometimes get an hour or two with no nest pokemon then other hours more than usual but probably not the same hours each day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am not sure about moms but as far as mons i can say with certainty that the nests nearest me do not spawn the migrated mons if its too late or too early this has nothing to do with the halloween event in my case an example is the migration poliwag nest i visit regularly for my walks if i get there around and walk for an hour there are zero spawns i go back during the daytime various days and i walk away with over a dozen same when i have driven by late at night this was the exact pattern when it was slowpoke jigglypuff etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is most likely a product of rng and confirmation bias
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can approve somewhere in august i went to an eggxecute nest until no eggxecutes spawned from to i caught at least
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to think similarly as i have a single spawn point nest that i can see from my house i used to think it didnt spawn in the evenings however after playing the game and watching this node for months now im pretty sure its just random as ive caught plenty at every single hour of the day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what i would do for an exeggcute nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea ive got execgute candies nest in central ct halloween event in full swing gg only spent morning there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,idk that was long ago i have no idea what spawns there now and not that many silphroad users in my country
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldve lived there for the whole event lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heh that option have i did not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im glad we have discovered all the useful things and moved on to this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think it might be your phone i cant reproduce it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i respectfully ask who cares
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can reproduce it iphone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here i can reproduce it too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can on an android
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what does this add to the silph road
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lmao sometimes i do this to gyms in my hometown and people usually dont mess with them for weeks because they dont know the is a visual glitch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dat bubbastrat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a question every person should ask themselves before posting on tsr
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,best point ever ssilph roadinterneti
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for every multiple of of a given pokemon that you catch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also noticed this the other day and didnt know what it was for thanks for asking the question
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats on catching a spearow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charizard is the most epic looking pokémon you can find in my opinion the first time i ran into one my heart sped up lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats but am i false when i say lured pokemon dont show in the nearby tracker in that case the spawn wasnt because of the lured pokestop correct me when im wrong
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congratulations still hoping to see a fully evolved starter in the wild some day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my cp charizard fled
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats ive just caught minicharizard cp only
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats of all the starters its charizard i wanna encounter the most
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and you both caught it ive seen wild ones and have nothing to show for it all of the ones i actually have are evolved
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice i just caught a blastoise in an airport thanks to lucky gps drift putting me on the other side of security
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky still never seen a charizard caught a dozen charmander today but my two local parks only generated or starters in an hour that i was at each
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charizard is the first starter i seen and caught today so awesome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for playing with your daughter i love playing pogo with my girl too she loses her little mind when something rare shows up on the radar i think shed literally explode if we ever saw a charizard in range
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent seen a single starter today probably caught ish others though mainly pidgey and meowth did get a ditto though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i ran into an blastoise earlier today most excitement ive felt from playing pogo in a while im crossing my fingers for a venusaur encounter because bulbasaur is incredibly rare for me it would save me a couple hundred kilometers of walking thanks niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we ran six blocks to catch one that showed up it disappeared as we were rounding the corner so mad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so sweet im happy for you and your kid im a grownup but playing with my dad who got an iphone for christmas while ive been visiting my parents this week has been a blast
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice catch good for you guys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw a venusaur as the closest by at work earlier too bad i was on my way to clock back in from break
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and then another show up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also ran into a charizard at a lured stop annoyingly my first two throws were excellent throws with ultra balls and with raspberries kind of what more could i do he ran after another one or two that were nicegreat every time for someone that only had charmander candies of which came from buddying it was especially crushing seeing as ive got a total of pokeballs of all kinds left after trying to catch a few of the bastards that are starter pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also encountered a charizard mine fled but i directly caught one for my brother and my friend caught it too i am not so mad about it because i already have a very good charizard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,doesnt this kind of post fit more into rpokemongo i mean theres no discussion or question here just a pic of a charizard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i honestly expected to see starters isnt that what the event was beeing announced for starters and their evolutions we will probably see more starter then we saw gengarsjust a guess of course
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i need to leave work and get my blastoise on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats awesome im happy to hear you and your daughter are enjoying this i also ran through the snow and ice yesterday to find a charizard myself and it was the most fun ive had playing the game since the summer its been hard to get motivated to go out in the cold but this event is making things so much more exciting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah this event is great i like that theyve made them common spawns but not the only spawns so i still see some other stuff found a porygon growlithe and rhyhorn earlier as well as some poliwags and magikarp definitely learned their lesson from the halloween event where we were drowning in the same few pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen squirtle and it ran away after a single great ball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen and all but venusaur and charizard today iall be just as excited if i see a charizard on my nearby
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hope to find one soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cant bring myself to thank niantic when i can still barely do anything where i live because they wont let us add pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my brother and i went for a run yesterday and saw all the starters but no evolutions still better than what was showing up before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,finally got enough charmander candy to evolve my first charizard an hour later i caught an even better cp wing attack fireblast
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i went from charmander candy to candies im loving this event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wowowowoowow u found a bellsprout i would kill for one of those
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats ive only seen one in the wild and it ran after one razzultra throw hoping to see another for the event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats i hope he was worthwhile right after reading this i looked at my nearby and saw a charizard at a notverynearby location as it was on new years eve i figured id do a brisk walk to catch him unfortunately he is only a and is only above average so hes only worthy of candy material but how do you turn a charizard into candy it seems so disrespectful so ill hold on to him for a while just because i love charizard he was my favorite holographic pokémon card and i even bought boxes of japanese cards on ebay in just to have both the english and japanese versions of him
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,doh thought that was a dragonite until i read the comments not surprising since ive never seen either one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,second halloween thanksgiving and increased spawnsitems
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha no way was i going to use the plus to catch charizard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i needed that lol thanks to op for wording it and photoing it that way to allow for that interpretation i am still laughing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i ran into a blastoise his morning only cp tho but this is my third blastoise i ran into other starter i ran into was venasaur
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just as gyarardos looks amazing in the wild
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,too bad it is useless in gyms though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep they dont as you can see the charizard is outside of the lure flower circle he was just chillin there had nothing to do with the lure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and charizard has white circles this is a normal spawn purple circles lure spawn
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,now this i do not know i will tell you that it kept appearing then disappearing and we even got the pokemon has fled notification from our pogo pluses
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,saw a blastoise a week or ago and stupidly wasted all my pokeballs on it knowing they werent good enough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,saw mine as pokemon of the event venusaur cp worst ivs oh well still caught bulbasaur yesterday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if any time is good to see one this event is already saw last night charizard and blastoise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught a venusaur days after i evolved mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here wild venusaur as stupidly common i think ive caught more than blastoise are uncommon seen in the wild charizard on the other hand almost never shows up and to get mine i had to travel a few hundreds km to get candies from a nest in another city this until a few hours ago wild charizard in all his power average cp and fled my zard has already pretty high ivs so i actually was really happy just to have seen it in the wild
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dang it that stinks sorry he ran away i still feel bummed about a snorlax running away from my home spawn point funny how this game gets to us
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on the same boat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would trade you whatever you wanted for that magnificent specimen if we could
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my first wild dragonite was a mini but ill never let him gosigh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice my wife and i just encountered a charizard after spending an hour at a hot spot and only finding the basic starters and then minutes away from home the charizard just popped up in the wild i caught mine cp after a million razz ultraballs hers was a mini like yours but unfortunately it ran away after a long fight
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes we both caught it thank goodness that would have been sad if we hadnt this was the first wild one either of us have seen i have evolved one tonight thanks to the event good luck to you i hope you find one too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kinda in the same boat still have yet to see an evolved on nearby or in wild in nearly a full day since event started not exactly thrilled with this event overall itsoh kay
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats by design for sure the hardcore get the rare stuff by grinding then they make it easy to keep casuals involved
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hi i have been educated by the commentsdiscussion on this post i did not know there was a way to tell which pokemon was there due to the lure or had appeared at a nearby spawn point i am currently level but im still learning regularly i see commentsposts like yours questioning the placement or value of a post on here regularly i learned quickly from down votes and unkind comments which posts were allowedtolerated as the silph road was started as hopefully a trading place and that has yet to occur i see no harm in sharing a joyous moment that may give others hope and excitement tbh i have had such poor luck with lures and incense that i have stopped buying them in my error i thought this charizard was due to the lure but the comments on this post set me straight happy new year to you and i hope you have a great event experience
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught like gengar and probably haunter for halloween event havent seen evolved starter yet or tier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldnt care if it was and id never transfer a charizard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i never seen charizard in the wild yet hopefully this event will help me congratulations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,especially since the go marker looks similar to the pokéstop tracking marker so at first glance it looks like op was tracking the spearow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol everything is useless in gyms most users can take anything down with ease
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ahem charizard does not chill
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah that happens but you can tell if the pokemon is from the lure because the circles under it are pink likewise if from incense itll be surrounded by the little pink cloud regular spawns have white circles underneath them as the charizard does in your screenshot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,had a blastoise appear this morning on sightings at a local church people were coming out of the woodwork to catch it cars pulling up everywhere people power walking up the street etc first time ive ever come across behavior like this in my town for pokemon go had a few good chats with people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got my first one today in the event and my first iv ever ivysaur niantic has made my day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw one in the parking lot three nights ago took me about balls with berries ultra balls to be specific
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would do the same
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same for me on charizard finally got my charizard yesterday afternoon and on my way home i just happened to see another charizard spawned at a big mega church nearby
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ha i also did see first snorlax first at my house door but it vanished immediatly the next one catched away in downtown witgh small hunt was excited and got then two from eggs and one more hunted down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lapras just ouside of my house i cry since weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a nice story and i am happy you are enjoying the event as am i i think its great you learned from the posts actually i was surprised that you are level and didnt know that but im level and who knows what i will find out on tsr that i didnt know as well i do agree with pokimonz though for the following reason if the over subscribers on tsr start posting their daily experiences new catches etc this sub will be overwhelmed with such posts every such post arguably might do as you suggest give hope and excitement but there are other forums better suited for that type of post i have hatched all the gen babies now does the world need to know that though should everyone on tsr post when they get their regional dex complete first dragonite take down their first level gym if a couple hundred thousand people start posting their special personal accomplishments the mods will get overwhelmed and useful analysis and research will get lost in the sea of personal firsts just one persons perspective happy new year
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,use a scanner theyre all over the place not as many as the halloween event but theres quite a few
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had never even seen a charmander in the wild besides my starter and caught my first charizard minutes ago and other charmanders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can confirm this morning within of my house i caught both a charizard abd venasaur this event has been crazy so far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes best of luck to you keep searching especially your usual spots we also found a charmeleon last night in an area i has lots of spawns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did once and it ran i walked very fast over half a mile from my office a few blocks away so i was not very happy at the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aha thank you very much for explaining i seem to learn something new daily which is good and humbling happy new year
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i came home from a visit to a friend a city over stopped at the last town before home at oclock to collect first spin and catch of the day spun the stop caught a bulbasaur check sightings blastoise at the same stop a few steps and one hyperball later i was owner of the same horrible ivs though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats on the ivsaur
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen squirtle since julyill evolve a blastoise any day now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess snorlax is the most desired pokemon i know i whisper snorlax when a egg is hatching
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i could top that with a snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for your excellent response i see your point and i thoroughly agree i will work to control my enthusiasm so as to keep silph road more productive and not make extra work for the mods happiest new year to you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i kind of thought it was an indirect response to my are lures crap post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same to this second ive never seen one charmander or any evolution besides my starter charmander
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what level do you get hyper balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for me its hitmonlee the only one i do not have the time i started august all gyms had snorlax in them and it did took months for me to get my first one funny i did catch it so was nice really even at
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do the same every time still waiting for my snorlax and dex entry it is so elusive for me ive tried to catch it a couple times way back in the summer but it always ran after many ultras and berries i havent seen in the wild since either some day any day ill finally get mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ya im sorry if i came off in a rude way i didnt really mean it in a bad way just more questioning the overall direction of this sub there wereare a few more posts similar to yours in the sub i just chose yours since it had the most traffic nothing personal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ha thats cool catching a wild snorlax is excellent😎 having a low cp can be great for prestiging and attacking if you like to participate in gyms at all good luck finding your bruce lee
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no worries happy new year😎
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes many thanks i already met him almost there was a player hows nickname is brucelee in ofbuscated form i always did think its the father of the boys but when i met them at one gym last week the man nicked to the boy and said no its not me its him yesterday some trainer walking by in downtown said they did see hitmonlee on other street min ago i did take a run no luck but got one dratini at least
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha your attitude is great we must be happy with what we find and catch 😃
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when i am far away from pokestops i see the sightings once near pokestops i am back to the nearby
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i never got new tracker so this is all i have seen for last few months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was using the nearby tracker restarted my phone and all of the sudden its back to sightings edit oh no nows its gone had to restart again cold weather and the nearby tracker is back i was so happy for those
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i heard that is the case but i was standing near to stops when i rebooted the game but its gone now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine showed sightings momentarily then went back to nearby
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gd tease
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it depends on how strong you are relative to your local competition and the balance of power within your location below id focus on grinding xp so you can catch wild pokemon at the max potential level and save on stardust cost of powering up pokemon later for example just today i caught a cp slowpoke that i evolved into a cp slowbro which is an instant toptier gym defender if you encountered that slowbro youd have to power it several times to reach the same level in the meantime focus on training up strong friendly gyms so you can practise dodging and pokemon selection and begin to gather a collection of pokemon for dealing with each type of defender at various cps for example against water pokemon which make up the majority of defenders i face i have jolteon tangela ivysaur parasect victreebell note these are my training pokemon for offense i mostly just use my dragonite or other high cp powerhouses
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im a valor with average gym retention a bit over a week in an urban environment been retaining guns gyms like that for closing in on months now because of that im pushing stardust despite having lapras vapeswater pulse and aqua tail exeggutor a snorelax and a dragonite as my defense team given my gym retention i spend minutes most days on gyms and collect coins every hours i have a giant mon spaced ever cp of basically every typing of low cp mon to train gyms with as im far more interested in that than taking them down ive got vaporeon wild catch dragonite that are and a snorelax a lapras and a flareon i use when i need to attack lapras for dragonite flareon for lapras my main team for everything else i dont bother putting a mon in a gym that has less than defenders if im doing bubblekarping or if im just joining a gym even pushing it a bit i probably do about bubbling in my neighborhood and getting in high level gyms elsewhere i used to karp instead of bubble till i got the right mon i bubble in my area so i can quickly return when my bubbler is kicked out and place a real defender in his stead i try to hold gyms given retention averages over week i lose less than gym a day average being about the worst if i held gyms id lose a day average and need to fight twice as much to keep pace theres therefore a balancing act between wanting to have gyms held every time my hours comes up vs the exposure to gym loss and gyms seems the right balance i do take down level gyms from opposing teams in my area just because other players dont seem to do it this returns the gyms to rapid turnover mode which allows them to build up a defender list worthy of me bubbling or straight up joining i just leave them grey or at prestige depending on the defender if its a pain to train against prestige is better because it denies that team easy gym access and keeps out freeloaders from my team while still being pretty quick for my team to take i find other gyms not in my area by a few methods local groups online occasionally driving home from my consulting gigs by city streets rather than highways and stopping every mile or two to look at the surrounding gyms and knowing team stacked neighborhoods because of how i occasionally drive home i know what areas are good for me one could also use maps online to find high level gyms but that would be cheating i ignore gyms in xp farming areas they flip too much regardless of size i find the gyms in my area because theyre in my area i pay particular attention to the visible from my condo because theyre easy to keep an eye on beyond all that i dont need to worry about not losing gyms the answer to that is in how theyre chosen and that bolstered by my strong defense team for you id focus on building a good gym training crew and keeping an eye out for top defenders with the right movesets i began powering up guys at or and only stuff that was at least generally higher
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you basically have to make sure no one else is around otherwise you have to be the one stealing by letting someone else do the work of leveling up the gym explore mostly you could ask people i guess i explore when i am on the bus or the passenger in a car i also walk around areas that i am in frequently sometimes you dont need to do anything just go by and train up extra slots if your gym has been worn down or find some new gyms and hope your old ones get maintained by other players wanting to get in the main thing is to just choose gyms that will last its tough without another player you could bubble strat it to level or if you want to but theres no guarantee your teammates will find it in time imo it is better to look for semiestablished gyms level and train up a slot for yourself the main thing is to learn how to dodge so that you can beat any defender with a lower cp attacker this is important for training and imo training to add yourself to strong gyms is more valuable than taking down enemy gyms starting your own fresh ones
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the gyms around my home are ridiculously fortified by one team many of the same names popped up one of which had dragonites in the gym ranging from to i know lapras will own dragonites but who has that many high powered laprases i assume move set for trainers are just as important as attackers do you care about ivs for these trainer pokemon how to avoid getting sniped after working a level to gym grats on your slowpoke ive only caught ever thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,great read very helpful to get this type of insight i appreciate it pretty far away in terms of team diversity what is this karp strategy also team valor
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the tips ill definitely keep these in mind moving forward
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just so you know you do knock down prestige even if you lose even one lapras can slowly take down a gym full of dragonites just beat one dragonite leave come back beat it again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,magikarping its pretty easy to get a low level magikarp and anything thats its cp and strong against water to kill it the only trick there is to dodge struggle which i can talk about if you need hints it requires potions somewhere between and to max a gym that starts at level but thats not too high a cost for a level gym its nearly as fast as bubblestrat and its far easier to get the right mon to make it work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awesome that makes sense thank you wouldnt training to level take a really long time even at per win since level requires also if you set up the magikarp how will you guarantee a spot with a higher mon in there later on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you only bubble or karp on top of a level gym so lets talk level first you need to train in this takes prestige of normal training that takes us from to now we add the karp or bubbler that takes us to then we train to this gives us real mon karp and open slots each teammate who adds a defender in adds another each which brings us to and opens the slot this final section takes about min at prestige per kill you only do this to gyms in your area because you need to keep an eye on it when you can use a revive on your karpbubbler you know that youve been booted return to the gym which is now likely level and train to get a real defender in and boost it back to profit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure about the mobile site or app but if youre on a desktop the right side of the screen on this subreddit has a timeline of notable additionschanges
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpspokemongogamepressggnews start here honestly its a lot so theres not really tldr
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a lot go to niantic blog
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not available on mobile ive never been on reddit on a desktop so i didnt know they had something like that im curious whats on it and what other subreddits have there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on the mobile site if you click the upperright to the right of the search icon you can choose to view the desktop site its probably a perfectly concise list of what youre looking for with links to more info for each thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know its a slim chance to get chosen for the beta test but im just excited to be part of this community and to see how it will grow in the next coming monthsyears when the game is live for everyone side note love the charles dickens quotesbrings out the literary nerd in me thumbs up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anyone else get in only to have an authentication error
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,be prepared and set your expectations that you are going to be helping niantic test not playing a final game thats why i held on applying for the beta test id rather wait a while longer and play a more polished game than to rush into and let it disappoint me i know i could just not set my expectations so high hopefully the first public build comes out soon after
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,better luck next time europe africa and the rest of asia v
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kudos to silph road for always trying to maintain the positive energy with posts like these
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hope that as the game expands they introduce new gen pokemon and as the game will be public there can be lots of official and unofficial tournaments and other lots of things organized by the silph community
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can i share a screenshot of the email saying i was invited to test
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if i send information to the global pokedex initiative is there a chance of my account being banned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you take a screenshot by dont post it or anything will you get banned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah even just the data crunching global pokedex sounds like something a realistic pokemon show would have canonizing pokemon into the real world even if its just a mobile game is a big deal for me i love that theres trainer tips on youtube and a radio to get in contact with trainers nearby the community around pokemon is so big and wholesome that its a culture all is own its nice that pogo is facilitating us pokemaniacs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait so you got an email
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pm udronpes here or on discord in the sidebar friend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a chance we think it is infinitesimally slim so much so that the executives are happy to use our own sighting data in the tool with no hesitation the only account bannings that niantic has enacted thus far have been for leaks in the very early days gameplay videos etc we have not received an account of any field tester being banned for sharing cp data etc despite that here are some of the reasons we feel confident the pokedex is restricted to field testers almost all data is displayed solely in aggregate for example the cp distribution graph per speciestrainer level or the breakdown of moves per species the map data is the only data that may be identifiable and we are randomly fuzzing it within an undisclosed radius and delaying a random amount of time before points appear for other researchers in your area overall niantic would have to infiltrate our pokedex which is whitelist only but possible then work backwards from some very very scant pieces of information to try to estimate what user saw what species where there is no time data on the pokedex information only location data so they wouldnt even be able to limit it to a specific day etc what little information is actually accessible to the other researchers will we feel not be enough to triangulate a single user with enough certainty to warrant a ban of course all of this will be a moot point soon when the field test ends
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my personal opinions leaking directly to the sr admins for things like this is probably the safest form of leaking you can possibly do theyve done so much to protect there currentpast leakers that id feel comfortable pming them screenshots of pretty much anything they needed lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh man i hadnt even thought of that i want to know too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no one has been banned for taking screenshots before friend only for sharing them out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not a tester so im just speculating but i would imagine taking screenshots would be part of reporting bugs and wouldnt autoban you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you dont post it then they have no way of knowing you did it to begin with p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dronpes responded
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly it can help them figure out the problem much faster than the trainer trying to describe it a picture is worth a thousand words
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im being pedantic but assuming you use your os builtin screenshot function this isnt true
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky btrd haha nah great man good luck d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well either way there is a few testeronly information dumps out there that they havent put a stop to so i assume documenting things for personal reference wouldnt be looked down on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think they were looking for ingress players two guys from our same office got in we were both high up in ingress and we both applied for the beta same day the signup was released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,devastated no email in my inbox but im only up to level in ingress i knew i should have played it more devastating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,weve got a level and a level that got in two level that didnt and theyre by far the most active ingress agents in our crew so anyone reading this please do not be harsh on yourself for not having played ingress more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont fret friend as dronpes was saying the beta is watered down and unfinished the real payoff will be when the game is officially released that and theyll probably do a few rounds of emails for the us beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whats the best browser for looking stuff up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonites are the strongest attackers in the game so best moves is dragon breathdragon claw or hyper beam however because of their inflated cp they are often just dropped in gyms in this case steel wing is usually preferred with dragon pulse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill be really happy if i got a dragonite no matter what movesets it has anyway steel wing gives me headache when i try to attack it with lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i love my cp steel wing hyperbeam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not sure let me google that for you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got steel wing dragon claw any good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,power it up and stick it in the top of a gym works better as a defender than as an attacker if it doesnt have dragon breath
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree with this i tried attacking with steel wing once and wasnt impressed so i stuck him in a gym never to see him again then i got one with dragon breath and omg he is my go to attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolved my recently all have steel wing wife has two both have dragon breath and dragon claw so unfair
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats how it goes gotta just keep grindingi guess thats what keeps me going still trying to get the right movesets but look on the bright sideyou have good defenders you can just drop off at any gym i am still trying to build up my team of defenders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you got enough candies for lvl and i worked hard for my one and only dragonite d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its hard to say really i havent played enough to see very clear patterns from my perspective common pokemons like rattata and meowth spawn just about anywhere you happen to be at about spawns every minutes rare pokemons spawn maybe twice a day and yes i have seen porygon and growlithe spawn in the same general area but honestly they could be spawning anywhere and i just happen to be there if you keep your ap open constantly youre going to come across rares for now at least
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as you found out means the pokémon will be the highest cp among your collection congrats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats amazing way to end the year
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cool thanks for clarifying much appreciated
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,were was the dog park location
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also if she didnt catch it you can check the journal to see what cp it was but maybe its best not to know if she didnt catch it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,calgary alberta canada just north of bowness near the bow river
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cool thank you i need a vacation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not disappear but there have been some local ones that seemed to go dormant or the nest was of a commonly caught mon in the area so it might have been better to be dormant
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,some of them only show at night or day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how long were you there i went to one of the best nests in my area and didnt seen any nest mons minutes later they were all over the place
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or there were fake postings by travellers putting something rare like dragonites or regionals to catch some attention so even though they explain that its not really a dragonite nest they still got removed from the atlas theres no way tsr can individually review each postings so they just removed it en masse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my city had about or out of nests disappear upon gen launch im not being flippant either ive checked and revisited and monitored and a bunch of them are plain gone including the one across the road from my house my interest in the game plummeted to casual once that happened now i just log in to get my daily and even then im forgetting most of the time anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it seems like it hasnt disappeared however the frequency of the spawns has plummeted now theres one every half hour compared to the previous every half hour
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its definitely been a nest for the past migrations todays the first day that whatevers migrated hasnt been ridiculously common the first nest migration after gen release was totodile and i landed totodile candy by the end of the two weeks that being said this week has been peculiar ponytas have been spawning as often as they normally would until today today theyve been spawning about as much as before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess it could happen same thing happened to some local nests some travellers even report the nest became pidgey or rattatas it will return to normal eventually
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it steps could be counted while offline it would use the pedometer which will count steps if the phone moves a little like shaking and with this you could exploit egg hatching and candy distance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry but this will never come pokemon go is a multiplayer game and in a multiplayer game cheating is a severe issue what you ask for is not possible to realize without opening pandoras box and make hardcore cheating possible for everyone sorry but that is an absolute nogo the only way something like that would ever be possible would be if they implemented a singleplayermode your account is saved on your phone only gyms are filled with randomlygenerated pokemon and your account will never be able to play online as long as it is a multiplayer game there definitely cant be any way to play it without internet access
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perhaps when the pokemon go apple watch app comes out you will be able to track steps offline i think the watch does this already just depends if the app will synch them we will have to wait and see
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish i spend a lot of time hiking without cell service i also get steps a day at work but because im in the basement i generally only get registered or less
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have read this argument so many times niantic could implement a limit on the number of steps one can acquire in a certain time similarly to how there is a limit on walking speed with the current system its possible to hatch eggs by letting the gps drift on the other hand if your gps drifts too much it negatively affects your hatching when you are legitimately hatching eggs by walking around is cheating really an issue for this particular aspect of the game why does it matter if someone hatches a few more eggs spoofers and multiple accounts are in comparison far more damaging to the game play
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have to actively spoof or use multiple accounts i could just attach my phone to my dog to get the pedometer shaking my dog never stays still unless shes sleeping
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you could also run a bot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know how to bot but i know how to use two accounts or spoof i dont i just like figuring things out the thing with cheating is there is no perfect way to stop someone doing it its about making it as hard as you can for them to cheat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly the current system is also not cheat proof right now people are driving in cars to hatch their eggs switching from accelerometer to pedometer would introduce new ways to cheat but also eliminate current ones cheating can therefore not be an argument against switching hatchingbuddy mechanics
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i find the best way to conserve revives is to use disposable attackerstrainers send in a wave of five recent evolves or captures with one tanky captain vape snorlax lapras wigglytuff etc to mop up if necessary where you dont care if they faint or not and will just transfer then afterwards this is good for clearing out the last couple of defenders in a gym or clearing the first defender out of a level gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont understand why revives can be a bottleneck i have revives i just dont let my mons die when i attack or prestige gyms which i do everyday the only time i really use them is to revive gym defenders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,another strategy is to become king of the rats instead of transferring raticates after a mass evolve keep the bitehyberbeam ones whenever you get a gym down to defenders release all the raticates after they faint transfer instead of revive professor willow will give you candy dead or alive more broadly this works for any of those evolved transfers you can have a whole b team squad just dont tell them what their fate is if they fail btw raticates really good against exeggutors too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes you have to be careful with revives now swap your pokemon before they faint and run if you need to dont always claim a gym if you dont need it for coins i carry a low inventory of revives and end up tossing a lot doing this because i have good access to stops it gets frustrating those days you need a dozen revives just to hold two gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there have been several strategies floating around here in order to conserve revives big problem is that when one does faint it goes back to your first mon in the lineup as opposed to your next one with full hp this can result in multiple fainted mons if there is lag or a dodge is missed ive been setting my last in the lineup backwards and it is working well for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you put your attackers in this order after one mon faints the injured one doesnt get instakilled also powering up a fainted pokemon revives them but doesnt halfheal them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it highly depends on the area one plays in i have so many revives that sometimes i throw them away i rarely let my pokémons faint in battle and i heal them with simple potions instead of throwing those away basically the only pokémon i need to revive are those that get kicked out of a gym and that happens about times per day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my strat is not to attack gyms if i already claimed my coins unless i want to enter a high lv friendly gym with the intention to stay for a longer time while doing my tour i use crappy pokémon like pidgeotto golbat ratticate and other trash from massevolving or evolved pokémon with bad ivmoveset i caught which i would transfer anyway so you dont have to revive my gym defenders while attacking a gym i always switch out before they faint or at least try to do so right now i have revives top revives max potions hyper potions super potions and potions i sometimes even feel i maybe need more potions than revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,didnt see this answer but here but im old and blind in my one good eye you can power up a dead mon and that will act as a revive substitute then said mon can be healed on the potions screen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and this gives you a good use for finding a hypno with bad ivs in the wild during the event i have about event pokes all names gym fodder easily findable when you have a gym in your sights but not many revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,send in a wave of five recent evolves or captures with one tanky captain dont even need the tanky one for taking down a gym pidgeotto and ratticate often works and for powering one up sometimes pidgey and rattata works evolve the dead pidgey and rattata to make more pidgeottos and ratticates
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i always used to never bother about my mons dying its only recently that ive started switching purely to save dying mons because this means of playing is unsustainable i guess what im saying is it wasnt always necessary to conserve revives in fact once upon a time revives were used to try and conserve potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for me the game is about having as many gyms as i can though p regardless of the coin reward i tend to use my max revives on pokemon kicked out of gyms and normal revives for everything else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is the best lineup if you know youll be switching pokemon after every battle for example if the defenders are a cycle of egg vaporeon arcanine gyarados egg and so on and you want to attack with fire grass water and electric fire
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not anymore since a recent patch late september i guess also usually prime attackers are already dust maxed same for my set of defenders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im actually thinking of using revives now to conserve potions i have revives which is more than the total of all my potions i wish at level you stopped getting revives and only got max revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do the same to save potions i have plenty revives pokemongo is only gym wars for me and my team all of us are at least at pokedex some are waiting for miraculous eggs other walk for candies this game has no other late game content than gym territory control
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tend to prioritize avoiding se hits over dishing them out id use an eggy first to take out and vaporeon then a vaporeon to take out arcanine and gyrados etc etc this minimizes switching this is all hinged on dodging everything you can with good dodges and a team of snorlax vaporeons arcanine victreebell and wigglytuff i can take out pretty much any gym lineup around me gyms tend to start around here and end up with a or dragonites save wiggly for the dragonites and im golden i just run if i eat a full hyper beam or something usually happens when my swype gets read as a tap due to human error
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup i read that somewhere else and tried it and wasted stardust
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is this thread necromancy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry i was searching for a method of effectively managing revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,change pokemon before they faint dont be too greedy on potions revives are more important dont throw good pokemon on every gym you see play in team and put pokemon only in towers minimum
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanksi do all of those except for the level to team to fill
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is there an uppercase i or lowercase l in the name they look the same in the game font so goidieiocks goldieiocks goldielocks and goidielocks will all look the same so long as the capitalized the is in lowercase l locations and lowercased ls in uppercase i locations wanna have trouble being reported name your account something like ilillililililililli
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my son and i have the same name just with a capital letter difference
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your secret is out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got a egg about days ago after month without one got an onix from it yeey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i actually checked today because i felt i got my last egg ages ago i wasnt quite as bad as yours but its been weeks in that time i hatched about eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im level and im yet to see a egg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive had multiple breaks from eggs the last one was a week stretch which ended with me getting glorious eevee im back in the hole another week now nothing worse than being blind and getting your eyes gouged
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can you hatch all your eggs go to a brand new location youve never been to before spin the pokestops there and let me know how many eggs you get i think theres a connection between how many times youve hit a stop and the probability of getting a egg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes its been at least a month since my last which was a kabuto
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im level got two at the start of the gsme and hadnt received a third until last week out of eggs hatched i have unfortunately thats just what happens when a system like this is actually random
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here that said im having a harder time finding eggs in general used to be able to keep going at all times now i struggle to find before a or hatches maybe the drop rate has decreased
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as you even experienced you can get spurts of or so if the droprate is which is what a lot of the data points towards then its most certainly possible and somewhat common to go through eggs before getting a level has nothing to do with any of this you should be posting how many eggs hatchedreceived
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope but then again i work hard walk a lot with the game open and pay money up front for incubators to always keep a couple of spaces free in my egg box currently got k eggs waiting to be hatched got all five of them yesterday if you dont have spaces free then how do you know if you could have had a egg from that last pokestop spin
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got today last one i had was onix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,level stops im still waiting for egg number if that helps and ive been using a lot of incubators
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same exact thing happened to me hit level didt see a again till from to i have got more though pretty regularly too bad the were aerodactyle electabuzz and a scyther
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,imo eggs are much rarer then people think ive been playing for months and got my first yesterday it hatched a bloddy scyther
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how many incubators have you bought the more you hatch the better your chances are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i buddy of my explained that if you calculate by chance one part can be explained the less eggs you have the bigger the chance for a egg if you have eggs and visit stops all time the chance is that you get another or is bigger than a but when you are full every pokestop you visit is a chance wasted so if the game has a pokestop vist to get a egg having to nine eggs wastes your odds for me it seems to make sense i only got eggs when i was pretty empty of eggs now i have a standard of to eggs and only get and km eggs when there is a egg space visiting stops a day anyone dug in the pokemon go data to find some parameter i forgot i was arround lev getting the first egg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds like my story except it was a jynx
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you wouldnt have wanted a sub par hatchling when you were under level so youre havent missed too much its really important to clear out your non eggs with as many incubators as you can afford youll increase the opportunity for this way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i didnt receive my first until level ive probably hatched now and still no snorlax im level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am usually running or more incubators never lass than that sometimes even and do walk around kilometres per week inapp at least last three weeks straight no egg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,stop spreading false information the more eggs you hatch the more likely you are to get eggs only because you hatch more eggs simple as that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that doesnt mean that the actual chance of getting a during single independent drop events is higher when inventory is less it just appears so if you have eggs your collective chance of getting over the next drops is higher than your chance of getting over the next drop when you already have eggs in inventory pretty logical because you have more chances but if you look at just the individual drops drop when inventory versus drop when inventory the random chance of getting a is exactly the same
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,update some one pointed out to me by pm that the chance is still the same maybe chance is the wrong term i usedis it probability english is not my native language i talked to my friend again and he explained it with a dice try to throw a six with six tries then with five etc so if you have eggs you have five tries to get a egg before the inventory is filled after that you still have a chance to get a but you dont receive it in your inventory so with eggs you have only four tries to get a before the inven is full etc i hope that clears up what i tried to say so running arround with a full inventory off eggs is a definite way of never getting a km egg while having space makes the probability to get one higher so if we can find out if the drops are linked to a of drops or how many stops you have to hit gives more food to the mathheads on the silphroad to write a chance tool update there is another factor is place for not getting km eggs thesilphroadcom trailpointer tip points out that eggs are seen as inventory items so if your inventory is full but your egg space is not you still dont get eggs so even when the chance hits to award you a km egg it is wasted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty sure thats what i said
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the way you phrased it made it sound like you were directly linking purchasing incubators to higher chance of receiving eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that box didnt say anything about being alerted if you didnt get in the beta it actually says when pokemon go goes to public release
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont tease me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is correct we should not be waiting for a you didnt make it email only a notification for an additional beta expansion or the games launch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but im not no one has gotten that email yet and a lot of people selected that box when they signed up which means theres still more to come right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn i was so desperate for some hope to hold on to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to a certain extent i know youre right to a greater extent i dont want to be disappointed by finding out ill have to wait for official release once that email appears saying invites are done
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds like youve been softbanned for reasons undeterminable by this post alone wait out a few hours and it should return back to normal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre softbanned for some reason spin the stop close out and repeat times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok that repeated spinning worked back to normal now thank you im still angry tho i had that stop lured
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after never having been soft banned since the game came out ive been soft banned twice this week albeit i was on vacation but i never spoofed i have been on vacation before and there was no problem i have a feeling they changed some algorithms it is very frustrating since i found a nest of pokemon that dont seem to spawn where i live and i missed out because of it didnt know the tricks about getting out of the soft bans at the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,crap seriously why also when you say close out do you mean close the stop or the app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,minutes is enough i was walking along the street when i arrive below a long bridge suddenly i was teleported to the middle of the ocean when the avatar returned i got softbanned luckily it wears off in minutes because i spin enough pokestops for pogo to recognize i wasnt gps spoofingdrifting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats irritating im sorry for your experience i find it super frustrating too because i pride myself on playing a clean no cheating game what the heck are they doing spoofers are running amok and the people who dont cheat are getting punished
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the stop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well did you power him up is he really
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all will show as afaik
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as far as we know it could pretty much be an karp power it up and share the new stats were now curious to see if its a perfect mon probably not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought that you couldnt power up magikarp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you certainly can
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought i saw an image where he was fed candy and received to both cp and hp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats because on low lvls the gains are too low and are rounded down to depending on each individual magikarp after power ups you can see the stats going up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ooooh thanks dude
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the testers did start with pokecoins when the game releases well probably have to buy the coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the initial testers did not start with pokecoins but were given some later on testers who joined midway through were given coins as soon as they started so it would be safer to assume you will have to buy lucky eggs with real money from the start they call it a cash shop for a reason they couldve called it the freebie shop if they were gonna give u stuff however we cant rule out the possibility they might give you a small number of coins to give you a taste of the cash shop if they do this expect them to possibly keep the amount just under that for lucky eggs since they are more than likely aware from people using them in testing that will be their big money maker also account for price fluctuations etc edit just a thought if you arent certain you want to spend cash on this game or you already decided you wont then you might want to use any free coins towards storage upgrades js
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or we can just get coins from the daily defender bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,except that potentially wont be available to everyone remember compared to the amount of people who wanted to play in the field test only a handful were actually chosen id have to estimate it was or less of people who wanted to play actually got to when it goes live dont expect everyone to be able to stay in a gym that can be held
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i might drop a few dollars at the start but after that ill just be saving up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea especially when gyms can hold up to pokemon theres not going to be an issue with that theres enough room in a gym for alot of people and if those gyms just so happen to be full then all you have to do is go knock down one of the opposing teams gyms and slap your pokemon on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man those dragon tms would be elusive for me its my only bronze badge on as well all others are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a similar a month ago how about linking tm free drops to gold medal completion that would mean one free tm per type and you get to choose which species and which poke to use it on if you already got the medal you get it when its rolled out if not you need to work for it beyond that you would have to buy them at the shop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was thinking maybe you get could a quick attack and charge move at each badge tier and having the tms increasingly better
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i almost had enough candy for one then caught one in the wild high cp low ivs so ive kept it to put in gyms haha what moves did you get
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exact same moves and ivs as mine i evolved him from a level or so dragonair hes up to level now i really want to get him to level but i put him on a gym and now he wont leave
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,such a grind the one i evolved has steel wing and dragon claw but hes only i hate how long it takes to get candys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the pokemon model not loading
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tiny pokémon glitchive seen it happen quite a few times wseveral different mons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is known
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,team instinct i wouldnt change because our team is cool
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on but would change to is significantly weak here and i cant stay in any of the gyms more than mins pretty frustrating i dont want to bandwagon so id rather join to take down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on instinct and ive restarted from because i hated being on mystic so no i wouldnt change teams because i already did its still surprisingly active here since its mystic valor being in a small town my effort has impact because i usually hit mystic gyms every day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,instinct wouldnt change gyms are active i like always having gyms to attack if i were id be so bored waiting for to switch then trying to get there before another blue took it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on and ever since i moved here has been overpowering i think i would stay because i feel partially responsible for the change in power and i enjoy keeping long term gym control if enough people quit and gyms got too stale after winter when i can play again i would switch to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,team instinct i wouldnt change there are gyms i can usually hold for at least a week i hit gyms on my home from work and can fairly easily take and get my coins and precious stardust if i drive around and work at it i can get in gyms for a brief time i dont mind being the underdog question i changed my name once is it possible to change teams
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on valor team in my area there is a war between valor and instinct both team have like gyms and north of my park is all yellow south of the park every gym is red the park is a battlezone last time when i see a blue gym was like weeks ago if i will change maybe would transfer to the yellow idk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all three hold lvl gyms throughout los angeles there are also gyms that switch every minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am on valor with one family member if a change was allowed two other family members would switch to valor why well because its valor
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,stay we might be seemingly the least dedicated but honestly i have a lot of pent up anger at this point and i refuse to switch to for context instinct have always been smaller but probably the most dedicated and have locked down one or two gyms rather than spread out and mystic have dominated my area until recently now valor is seeing a resurgence but we dont have much staying power which is why the most important thing to do at the moment is prestige gyms fast and ruin any mystic gyms before they get any ideas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im team valor i would consider switching to instinct but not mystic i love taking down gyms but training is boring
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here is toulouse france mystic is dominating around instinct around and valor is dying out except one or two big teams i am in instinct team and i dont want to switch at all i am from what ive found the highest level instinct player in the area at and responsible for many raids against mostly mystic or noob gyms max i managed to get many friends in our team and to gather a lot of serious players to build a lot of strong lv gyms thanks to that my daily coins are ensured for almost a month mystic team is just not really organized they build a gym and then people will just fill it with what they can like horrible pinsir or sometimes arcanine to get good valor team have a least two big teams that build strong gyms but usually they cant profit of the player base to reinforce their position or just leave them safely like the blue team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldnt change because the gyms in my area are dare i say balanced there are pockets of strength for each in the area but its actually pretty even
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,team valor id like to change to team mystic because they continously hold most gyms in my town free coins are nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so you want to know how many people would change teams bc gym dynamics have become boring does the answer matter as given the current game dynamics the situation would repeat itself gyms have been boring for different reasons in dense metro areas since day and once you hit level wfull podex well start teeing up a few more polls about what you might like to change about your game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,judge people who use it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i assume upvotes will count as survey responses
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is not possible to change teams
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im with an almost full dex its not about that even now with how much time ive put into the game i may start over just so i can be on the same team as my wife doesnt that seem a little silly she cant progress as fast as me shes lv she chose a different team without much thought we have done good times bringing down instinct together id be nice if we could do it a bit more and train a gym together as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so youre telling me your wife knew you were valormystic and choose a different team nevertheless furthermore you didnt bother to tell her to join the same team as you before hand i smell trouble brewing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes no i did tell her she didnt think it would really matter she chose what she likes and i love her for it hindsight is we both regret not being on the same team ive actually quitstarted over so we can be on the same team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,husband of the year right here folks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol im just happy shes playing a game with me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,even if they made it so you had to be within range of the gym i guess it makes sense that you cant power them up from miles away it would be a welcome improvement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm you probably collected the rewards after leaving a pokemon in a gym then the rewards go on a hour cooldown then that gym gets taken over by a different team and then the bonus shows as once the timer is over you can put a pokemon in the gym and collect your rewards again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also this doesnt give me any coins after the timer ends edit im stupid
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe you collected from a gym and your pokémon got knocked out real quick seems really weird for it to just start on its own if you havent been battling
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to clarify i have been battling and ive held the gym for quite a while this also happens when i add my pokemon to a gym and i am sure that my pokemon is there i currently have my arcanine in a gym and when i tap the bonus shield thingy nothing pops up if i didnt have a pokemon in a gym and the timer wasnt on then it would tell me that i needed to assign pokemon to gyms to be eligible but here nothing happens i cannot access the bonus even if i have pokemon in different gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you collect the gym rewards within the last hours if so the timer will run even when all the pokémon you held in gyms have been defeated the timers not going to disappear just because you have no gyms are you sure your arcanine is presently still in the gym have you checked that it hasnt been returned and is waiting for a revive are you saying that even when you added a new pokémon to a gym the number in the shield will still be or that the number says as it should but the timer is still running have you tried force quitting the game and restarting it this really seems like user error to me because i havent seen or heard of anyone else with this problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no yes shows the little p in the bubble number says and timer is running even if i add a pokemon to another gym completely new gym taking it first time i cant get the bonus the shield button number changes but cant tap to collect force quit restart reinstall log in and out it is very possible that its me being a dumbass thank a lot for your help though d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok im just saying this to make sure were on the same page once you collect coins from a gym any gym you cannot collect coins from any other gym for hours you can collect coins from multiple gyms if you have pokemon in several gyms at the same time but only if you havent collected coins within the last hours there are not separate timers for separate gyms the timer does not reset when you have zero pokemon in gyms you dont get a bonus for having a pokemon in a gym for longer then hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks a lot for clearing this up the first point was where i was confused confirmed i am an idiot enjoy the gold d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also dont power up a magikarp until youve evolved it and know its gyarados moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope youll find a better one wait for level when it comes to magikarp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rpokemongoivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not enough information to advise you sorry btw you might get a better view of the ivs if you add more detail in the goiv with the apraisal function
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you for your fast answers added cphp dust and candies when i check an iv ive been told to check its the med percentage is that how you guys check iv also if thats true to me seemed pretty neat guess i was wrong lol then i might search for another one which med is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,didnt know about that sub i might ask there thank you all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you are on ios i highly recommend using poke genies for your iv calculations you just add your screen shot and manually input appraisal info
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep most folks dont
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on android
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah well sorry and good luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,although this is great life advise im not seeing how this relates to tsr or pogo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,something to do with limited sources of income at that age for say buying a holiday box
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is coming soon a public resource will reside at thesilphroadcomnests and will have a map that even nontravelers can benefit from youll be able to filter by species or see them all at once and filter by types of nests for example if youre only looking for cluster nests were super excited about it stay tuned for updates
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe they said thats coming but im not sure where
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,right above your comment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,zzmmrmn was first
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,says out of stock
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,keep checking throughout the day or probably the next few days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i usually use a tracker site like httpwwwnowinstocknetvideogamingaccessoriespokemongoplus to monitor this kind of thing after the whole amiibo craze i cant deal with the constant refresh and disappointment im guessing there will be a ton of these things in stock near christmas time seems like a good stocking stuffer item
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this at pst it came back in stock
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpwwwapkmirrorcomapknianticincpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anyone getting the battery saver inverted so that it turns the screen off when it is upright hahaha what a joke of an update this one was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after this android update a couple issues have occurred in pogo the go plus refuses to connect i tried restarting the gamephonerepairing bluetoothresetting the go plusreinstalling pogo nothing works the go plus is useless atm when exiting the gym menu my game freezes about of the time rolling back to an older version of pogo did not fix these issues thanks google
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after update to everything slowed and performance lagged gym battles became untenable pokestops were horrible with jog walk spin stop wait jog again reverted pretty bad when an update makes the previous crash prone version so appealing that many have rolled back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you that worked perfectly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,april fools
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you drop your phone my gyro has done this before well battery saver on whichever orientation as soon as its selected when my phone slipped off my lap it fixed itself again when it next slipped out of my hand to fall a similar distance or so though i wouldnt have dared drop it again on purpose to try to fix it i was very relieved it did
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,step forward back it is the niantic way i still think that the version from august was better than what we have now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so what you rolled back to and its fine i cant log in on the new version at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for android is coming
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes rolled back too the new version works on my tablet but doesnt go past the loading screen on my phone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,okay what should they do about strength
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,disable all fitness apps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mil for me was super stoked to hit today im a free to play trainer so i had to save up some coins to buy a pack of lucky eggs the most coins ive ever spent at one time haha i have a walking path about minute drive away it has pokestops and gyms along a path each night i could catch enough pokemon to do a mass evolve with a lucky egg thank god i saved all my candy from halloween i played less this event than any other but had a damn good time as always congrats to you and the kids on that first snorlax op
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,during the event i got million xp had just reached now only left to reach level pokemons caught stardust ditto he stayed in the game though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did it end today i thought it was ending on the
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got from high to low i had the best min ever on wednesday caught my first ditto then instantly later another ditto then eggs hatched a chansey then a porygon my nemesis completed my regional dex with hatch with that porygon two sec after that i hatched a perfect bulbasaur my first ever perfect i spent the rest of the event speedwalking circles around a a bulbasaur nest catching them for candy visited that nest twice a day every day and now i have a perfect maxed venusaur the absolute best thing though was when on thanksgiving i got my dad to give pogo a try now hes addicted he caught a lickitung as like his pokemon ever when he was just at just level ha ha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,started from ended at lvl about exp and dust i hatched over eggs battled gyms collected coins every day and caught every single pokemon my pokebag is items and it was filled completely so i evolved no lucky egg over pokes and transferred them event was cool
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,xp for me without playing much more than usual just avoided evolving pidgeotbeedrill and tried to catch everything mainly for stardust used two of the lucky eggs i still had and attacked gyms when finished evolving
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lvl to and dust more or less snorlax with good iv but crapy cp only used lucky eggs it was a fun event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,xp stardust went from lvl to i had been collecting candy ever since i reached wanted to do a xp evolution spree my hoarding habit finally paid off with this event spent about hours during last week with just thr evolves p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got about xp i only really played on friday and sunday because i was busy with family and work but i used three lucky eggs giving me of that xp before the event even started i had enough saved up for almost two lucky eggs so that helped a lot the rest of the xp mostly came from hatching eggs i walk a lot and spent money on incubators
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got about from lucky eggs evolve sessions i have no idea how much from regular play i skipped entirely over level and this week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got about exp hoarded stardust xd hoarding trash pokemon for xmas evolve hopefully
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i started the event just having hit level now im just over halfway through so about xp it was a lot of fun to see my level bar rise so quickly not to mention bouncing back from running out of stardust still no ditto but im holding out hope and catching everything i see i only used one lucky egg and i still have more i just couldnt catch quite enough to justify using a second lucky egg ill get there though its much slower progress for someone who plays maybe an hour a day but these events are really keeping it interesting im excited for a possible christmas event hoping it will be just as fun as these last two
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got just over mill exp and half a mill stardust not a bad week to be honest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mil here not sure how much stardust though assuming around
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,million for exp using lucky eggs and just shy of stardust definitely a good week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,didnt really play as much as i should have i really wasnt able to until saturday but then went overtime at my shellder and machop nests the last two days then hit a pokestop dense area to restock on balls which was an ineffective effort because i was also bagging every pidgey and rat in sight to evolve and no lucky eggs l so got about xp forgot where i started only away from lvl oh and stardust uh well ever since the stat rebalance ive dumped all my stardust into the pokemon that got buffed and have ideal movesets stardust is empty again and i still have more stuff that i want to get up to my current level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,between i only had a lucky egg on during evolution session
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,level to almost now not sure how many xp that is cant wait for the next event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,million stardust
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was able to grind dust its the most i ever had so very excited i also hit level as i grinded about exp putting me a fifth in to level i was at around past great event though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,about half a million i just played around my neighborhood which isnt the ultimate and has been rainy burned my last couple of lucky eggs and wont get more until i get them from leveling it has been profoundly satisfying since the event ended to realize i dont have to hoard pokemon i can simply see that i have pidgey candy evolve and transfer it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,went from to about into so about million xp as well as half a million stardust had some real life stuff to contend with too so didnt get as much time to play as i wouldve liked still managed to deplete most of my candy though so im happy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mil xp late to did lucky egg sessions total three of them with nine incubators running got onix pinsir hitmonlee and magmar so nothing to celebrate but the exp and dust not sure about total stardust as i was spending a ton during the event i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,due to work and classes before this event i was highest level player on my group but some of the hours players of my group who were a couple of levels behind me made million and hit real life sucks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,during this event i didnt focus on xp since i lost interest after hitting i did catch every single pokemon i saw in the wild got around stardust which was amazing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,m from to glad the event is over lol now i need to fill up on balls xmas and save some coins back to back events is a good way for them to make real money
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i broke the second day and now im at to all said and done id say i got around a million also managed to finish my pokedex while i was farming the xpstardust got of my friends to drop a little cash for lucky eggs and they both gained about levels in the mid twenties one hatched his first lapras too it was a great time felt a lot like the early days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish id made a note of exactly where i was at the start of the event but i went from about halfway through to halfway through so approximately xp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,about xp i went from very high to a quarter into something like stardust too which means i can power my tiny psycho cut psycho alakazam right up now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks the kids were unbelievably excited especially since after all these months it spawned on our street congrats on a good week and have one more free coin for your hard work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a game have fun with it dont turn it into work it sounds like youre not having fun but feeling a compulsion to play if so take a break the games still there tomorrow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im about the same also xp and from high to now but i thought i gathered way over stardust didnt keep exactly track of it got my iv dratini hope it wont be my consecutive steel wing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic said it would end nov midnight utc utc is more or less england time it is past midnight on the in england now so its over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree on the second lucky egg i had unfortunately done a mass evolve right before the event was announced managed one during the week but only had about evolves left today so kept the lucky eggs in my pocket for whatever comes in december
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol pretty much mirrors what i was going to say i went from low to just crossing as the event ended not sure what the xp was but i guess if i actually tried this hard all the time i would have got here a lot quicker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,woah hahaha you are too kind or drunk probably drunk thanks op first reddit gold cheers and happy hunting to the whole family now go find them a lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,obviously taking a break now having your time be as valuable playing the game is basically forcing me to play sticking to my gym raids and some chill farming once in a while now can wait
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ohh okay didnt notice utc thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your wording is a little ambiguous utc on day x means midnight between day and day x more precisely between on day and on day x so the event was scheduled to start at the beginning of november midnight between november and and terminate at the beginning of november midnight between november and
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i missclicked on a lucky egg like before the event was announced resulting in me panic evolving every pidgey i had all the way to pidgeot i went from to pidgey candy which means i loost more than possible evolutions during the event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the implementation of events has been refreshing to me for that reason i can casually grind for a few weeks and then have a reason to go really hard for a week i think its a nice cycle now that ive almost completed my pokedex and have lost the drive i had during the first months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whats your top mons look like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantics wording was a little ambiguous fixed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nothing special
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic didnt say midnight uthefungibleman did niantics wording was not ambiguous the only problem was that many pokemon go players do not understand the basic conventions of coordinated universal time utc niantic worded its announcement which is to an audience of people around the world as simply and clearly as possible in terms that are internationally established as httpsenwikipediaorgwikiuniversaltime since by the international astronomical union
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mmm i see
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel like im the only one that doesnt name stuff like haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do stuff like sheaswhb unique name first then moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed i give mine names and just try to remember the moves and ivs i love those little monsters snorlax doesnt seem right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a true master knows the movesetiv from the name alone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah yes i do have some with just names like philip my first ever lax from back in october that has ivs and lickhb i also have dibo and frevoso which were my first nites ever theres also zephyr and oreo who make up my vape trio along with dephendo which i evolved from eevees back when the pokedex iv bug wasnt fixed and the grand finale is sir icyholix the vaporeon that i got inspiration for my name it was my first ever cp mon and it has water gunwater pulse also a hypno which was my highest cp mon on the first day of playing is going to be forever kept as he is a memory he has zen headbutt and psychic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a pro has more then dragonites name one parent with kids that gets them right everytime
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have more than dragonites i know the ones that matter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish i had your skills where can i download them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky i have somewhere around nites i think
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,downloadmoreramcom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just wished we had a dratini farming spot everyone here has dnites and no candy haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mostly agree if time is not your top priority one can take down all three dragonites you mentioned in about the time with breathclaw dragonite with dodging of course
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a lapras at the same level of your blissey will wipe the mentioned dragonite as well but faster even if you have to dodge some if you are good at dodging use dc dragonite to achieve the fastest outcome your reason is contradicting you do not want to dodge because it is slow however your solution is to do no dodge but in a longer battle time so what did you actually get
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and chansey is a decent prestiger for the same reasons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the only thing you must have to take down a level gym stacked or not is time the rest is details
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah time really should be your top priority when playing in gyms potion efficiency is great if you love jamming on the attack button
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to love my lapras to take out dragonite before nerf and she could easily go through dragonites quickly but shes been in a gym for a while so i tried out my espeon holy cow future sight knocked that dragonite out way more quickly than my lapras with ice moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whats a blissey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should have seen the hate when i first said blissey was the best attacker based on max potions peoples minds were blown she is so much tankier than any other pokémon she broke the game and required an emergency patch days later we will see if she remains untouched till gen i doubt it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait if time is one of your constraints isnt blissey with her average attack a liability for that wouldnt likevapes be better well obviously not against dragonites especially if you have a dazzling gleam blissey i do agree with the potion efficiency however either a max potion or a revivehyper is all you need
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this would have been informative maybe a week ago before everyone and their mother wanted a blissey because of her bulk and general usefulness attacking or defending she was long decided a must have for those interested in the strongest gym presence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh boy youre so wrong about the slow and boring arguments and youre not open to contradicting arguments so why bother only thing youre right is the max potion thing but good luck stacking those back up after you continuously healed your blissey army
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,although blissey is in fact the best attacker by far due to its high survavility i much rather secure it a good spot on a gym and keep beating dragonites with something else unless i could somehow manage to have or more maxed out of them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im in a machop stronghold so i have a couple powerful machamps with dynamic punch and they kill blissey and snorlax extremely fast dynamic punch is waaaaaay better than close combat you only have to charge one bar and charging two is the equivalent of an attack power of its stupid powerful if they implement critical hits machamp will become even more dangerous hang on to those crosschop machamps just in case
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use cloyster against dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my blisseys are always in gyms though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,second this if you want to save on revives and dont care about relatively slow battles blissey is amazing and never dies its easy to think of her as a defender but its great to have a blissey on your attacking team because youll survive anything and make it through the whole gym poundhb is often the best for offense but psychic and dg work well too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you want to save potions and not dodge blissey is a good choice if your top priority is speed she is not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that makes me super happy i have one wild caught dragon at cp still walking my dratini up for a decent one but i have a blissey who ive been powering and she has poundhb guess i know who im walking after dragon time im one of the poor saps who never gets gym money maybe this can help
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is really good if you are mindlessly playing and have a nice supply of max potions ill take down gyms like when im waiting at a restaurant and this strat is perfect but most of the time im plenty full on items and need to dump some and time is also very important for me to get in and out as fast as possible i dont like to be standing around looking creepy longer than i have too so i usually value high dps much higher than efficiency
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive written many posts praising phb blissey my primary phb sounds almost identical to yours cp with hp hes great at taking down dragonites i usually make it through dragonites varies depending on defender level and movesets with dodging he shines when going through a series of many battles in a row at a high level gym as you described especially ones with low level blisseys i like to use heavy hitters to get through the blissey defenders then use phb blissey and sometimes vapothers to get through the higher level easier defenders so i minimize number of blissey defender battles with blissey i dont need to use my limited remaining slots for countering all the different higher level defenders instead i get through many different defenders with a single slot in my lineup that said if you are concerned with speed there are alternatives that will save you a good amount of battle time including the extra time for dodges but you will likely need to use revivespotions more often and split up battles more if you are missing charge move dodges which may end up costing more time and resources
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i definitely agree that blissey is a beast but i dont think shes a must have she offers a very boring but consistent battle i personally like to have my battles planned out by type a little better usually but i will use her if i just need a tank to plow through a few pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have to assume blissey will get nerfed so i am reluctant to dump precious dust into one but the potion efficiency makes it very tempting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rediculous statement i took down a gym yesterday in one day spoofed with blissey snorlax and dragonite all had ivs over and were about lapras for three dragonite so pokemon mainly dragonite to kill the tanky made it even though i missed a dazzling gleam on a dragonite would have been a stupid mission to put a blissey in that lineup takes way more time and it centainly would time out against blissey maybe even against snorlax if you want to spend a lot of time taking down gyms and youre a bad fighter maybe it can be useful to me blissey is a stupid and slow attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or cp jolteon with dodging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this i love both my dbdc dragonite they shred through anything even through dragonite with good dodging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep i love coming across sw dragonite defenders as they are so slow so i just keep using db and then finish him off with multiple dragon claws sometimes i am so lazy that i just continue to use my vap with hp as although it says not effective i can still take down dragonites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im a little lost i understand there are stronger move sets for taking out a dragonite but im just trading the time you spend dodging for many many more attacks i will get off or quick attacks to your one while you dodge and after two hyperbeams the dragonite is kod and as i mentioned before this only cost me one max potion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my point is that one missed charge move attack and my lapras is done for and vs dragonites i will miss several there is no room for a mistake missing just a few quick move attacks alone will take out a lapras not to mention a charge moves or two there is no contradiction dodging takes time just like attacks take time for every dodge you make i will make one or two more quick move attacks and my charged attacks will come faster lapras has a better move set but im attacking twice as fast i did not time it but i was never even close to timing out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,before nerfing sure a single lapras could take down same level dragonites ie v post nerfing the return is more like and thats if you dodge reasonably well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or a team of trainers that can be quick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,chanseys evolution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ohhh they patched her that explains it mine was unbeatable at first and now they seem not much different than a badass snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed pretty sure she will be nerfed sooner or later
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only thing youre right is the max potion thing but good luck stacking those back up after you continuously healed your blissey army if you are like me and do not carry anything less than hyper potion to conserve bag space then there is no potion issue a revive hyper full heals a blissey just like other pokemon its only an issue if you are trying to heal a blissey with regularsuper potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can even dodge blisseys attacks thanks to machamps power and kill them so long as your champ is at least
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in a water biome so i see a lot of gyarados and dragonite in gyms turnover is not that high so potion efficiency is not a huge problem so i mainly end up rolling with my jolts or dnites for attacking it seems like blisseys relatively low dmg would negate the need to not dodge and make it take just as long as using dnite and dodging i go for the super fast way of using high dmg mons and only dodging charge moves but as i said potions are of no concern
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the reply bottom line for me is i really love the game and gym play and catching them all yadda yadda but im a bit lazy with the gym battle and i can be my storage is generally maxed at items and i spin stops a day auto set pokemon go and i drive close to miles a day i really loved the bulldozerjuggernaut of my newly discovered blitzed blissey attack that being said im always looking for better ways to do battle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,imho respeeding up the quick moves already nerfed blissey indirectly by allowing higher level solo players to take them down it was already easy to do with a team blissey cause heavier potion use but it isnt a wall its mostly a time sink
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blissey wont get nerfed they released how it is its been tested for months and their quickfix applied days later this update is designed to specifically make a larger amount of mons useful and break up the monotony of the existing meta fighting mons are a legitimate counter to snorlax and blissey now go farm machops if youre struggling with blissey its unlikely well see any more combat changes or re balances for months now if there are theyll be when comes out or possibly when pvp comes out as a result of battles needing some tuning but thats it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no in reality you spent more time even if you did not dodge at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think your opinion will not get agreed by people here because it is clearly wrong blissey with cannot beat lapras with in regards of timing also using lapras is already errortolerate you can miss a few quick move and one charge move but will still finish dragonite easily the less errortolerate that require a bit more dodging skill solution is to use dc dragonite you get zero hit and finish dragonite in the fastest way i do not expect people have too much problem on dodging at level unless they do not really do gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont seem to understand that blissey has extremely low attack stats so if you get out pounds with blissey in the time a dragonite which has a huge attack stat gets out a single dragon breath then the single dragon breath deals more damage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same because attackers are slightly buffed due to charge move buff and lapras has the main hp stats remain which does not affect the performance too much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty sure they do that day after i walked to finally evolve my first and another to bring her to max
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you drive close to miles a day seriously people like you arent even playing pokemon may as well spoof or play on a hand held at home ffs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how do you figure gen came out with an entire move rebalancing then less than a week later they rebalance again if they had it tested so well before release why didnt they just release gen with how the quick moves are set now instead of how it was actually released with quick move nerfs this leads me to believe it wasnt really tested very thoroughly and they either had to revert or quickly rebalance again i expect ninantic to do some sort of rebalancing at some point before pvp or gen even if it is minor tweaks and blissy is the elephant in the room for lower level players she is still an immovable object that effectively walls them off from half of this freaking game i doubt they want to alienate a big chunk of their current and any future playerbase
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if that is reality then i suggest you try out a php blissey in a gym granted it might not be the most efficient but it sure is a lot of fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah my way is not the best way but its simple and direct and cheers anyone can do it no worries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i took down level gyms yesterday the first gym i could dodge basically everything without much difficulty the second gym i could not i suspect my internet connection was worse there i was constantly getting my health taken upon a successful dodge then given back if youre at high health when that happens no problem if the move would kill you without the dodge then the game still glitches to hell and back making it impossible to see anything let alone dps and dodge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i understand what you are saying and your logic seems sound but with my lack of dodging ability or lack of wanting to work that hard at it the blissey is a god send i have of them and still over candies i am dominating my gym biomes with it until the dreaded nurf comes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont see the issue with what stoneclyde is doing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol the focus of his day is not driving miles to play pokémon go why be so quick to place a judgement when you can easily figure out that this guy is trying to have fun while he does a job
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,before the move readjustment at least id attack any enemy gym near me that had a huge blissey in it and knock it down until the blissey was at the bottom making it almost impossible to prestige against funnily enough since then i dont see those blisseys in gyms any more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if i see a higher level enemy gym and i have time to kill i dont mind tearing those down no matter what is in there i will however stop my attack if a blissy is at the bottom of a actively defended gym i could still easily take the gym but i know they will train it right back up so me ignoring a bissy at the bottom really hurts that team in terms having to prestige through a blissy now once it reaches ill start to attack again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because i know how the industry works and none of it was done overnight on a hangover the update was probably just not the latest iteration of combat and they realized when it went live and updated it days later
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre not using your mons right also dg is way better at d and attacking dragonites and dragonites with dbdpdc is still better for slaying other dnites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the gym system is so incredibly easy i dont understand how you couldnt tap and swipe every seconds even if its just for charge moves doesnt it get boring just tapping on your screen repeatedly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it undermines the game as much as spoofing removes the steps to the in game reward system
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also dg is way better at d dg gets a effectiveness against dragonite and hb gets a for stab against other mons besides dragonite as well so you get similar results with both movesets in the described attacking situation id expect hb to have a small edge in a series of battles where you can use the hb bar buildup from the previous battle on the next defense is more complex and off topic and dragonites with dbdpdc is still better for slaying other dnites obviously a dbdc dragonite is faster but youll get through more defending dragonites with a phb blissey so if you one of the lucky few that has access to both the best option depends on your priorities and play style do you prioritize faster battles or prioritize losing less of your hp bar per battle so you can make it through more defenders it isnt a matter of not using your mons right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol dodge dg vs dodge hb etc etc the math is the math the practicality of it is a dg vs hb dg will take longer and do more damage vs a skilled attacker factory
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this thread is about attacking with blissey not defending against a blissey attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,appreciate this post and the creative idea herein but unfortunately this topic is stirring up a little too much drama on the road right now and the community is fatigued of the topic from the many posts and suggestionsideas about it in the past few days were consolidating this discussion to the threads already on the front page about this thanks for helping us keep the road constructive and uncluttered
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we keep things courteous on the road if you feel a topic is too prevalent on the sub just shoot the mods a modmail rudeness to other travelers will not be tolerated here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the constructive discussion i appreciate your time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol youre kidding right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fire blast does have a higher dps than dragon claw their rankings would still be the same though even if both pokemon could get the same moves because charizard gets stab with fire blast and dragonite gets stab with dragon claw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it has no stab on charizard rending it as bad as dragonpulse on a lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fire blasts base dps is a bit higher so yeah in a way it is better but dragonite gets stab on it so even if dragonite did learn fire blast he would be better with dragon claw dragon claw is the best move when fighting dragonite though on both pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not as bad as that dragon claw is a better move than dragon pulse just by the base damage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,even the opening line suggests a release date announcement is coming very soon its getting closer its been sort of like making a big meal for your friends or family we have been sweating the details in the kitchen and now we are anxious and excited to share our creation with you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree with you it seems really close now from emails to testers in australia new zealand and today to americans we had exactly one month i think that us will be the last beta test field so i bet that in less than weeks itll be released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i completely agree with that and i hope we will see a post with a release date soon or at least a narrower field of when it will be released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hope so too but i cant help but worry that theyre referring to their upcoming us beta testers when they say you in that sentence not all of us the lack of any info on release dates hints that it could still be months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hope youre right friend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its getting closer its been sort of like making a big meal for your friends or family we have been sweating the details in the kitchen and now we are anxious and excited to share our creation with you who is in the kitchen preparing the meal all niantic team and beta testers we only share a dish when it is ready i guess that you means all pokemon go future players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and us is for sure the bigger and the most complicated market in the world this is the last test because if it works well there it will work anywhere theyll only need to translate it what is probably already almost done
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all eggs appear green in the journal this is not indicative of the type of egg you received eggs appear as different colors everywhere else but in the journal hope this helps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,possibly you already had an egg hatched but had not seen the hatching animation yet on screen as it doesnt always show up straight away the egg had already hatched and would show in your pokemon if sorted by recent and in journal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont understand can you screenshot if you dont have room then where did the egg go does your bag show eggs or something
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep this is exactly what happened to me a couple of times was surprised to get an egg as i knew i had a full egg inventory so opened the pokemon list to see a new pokemon that was hatched then i went back to the game screen and that is when it showed the hatching animation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if it happens again ill make sure to take some screenshots the egg went nowhere it wasnt in my bag my bag has capacity for eggs and i had eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i should have added that the egg never appeared in my bag i only realised i had gotten it because i browsed through the journal i have my game in spanish if it happens again ill make sure to take screens
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lmao huevos man i want my bag to say huevos too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not a journal just doesnt know colors for different eggs it shows them all in green color like they were before professor willow discovered patterns in eggs edit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks i thought there was something wrong with my game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,itd be interesting to see this repeated with a plus pokesplosions get cleaned up quickly with one so even if youre not catching all of them you can hit more areas in much less time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pogo makes it even quicker with no catch screen and no after catch screen just instantaneous back to back catches while unsuccessful pretty often nets a heap of stardust disabled pokestops on the pogo and used the game to collect only stops while the pogo caught pokemon cycling between major spawn routes i got about stardust just under including two incubator hatches at times could barely keep pace collecting enough pokeballs from stops from what i was using an additional bit of info the only worthwhile catch i saw from the new mons i got was a low cp electabuzz everything was just utter junk along the routes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you have a go probably would have been able to move around more hatch more eggs and encounter more pokémon thus maybe more catches
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hours is a bit much when i do my daily grind i usually get stardust hour so hours would be enough for i catch around pokemonhour no pogo incubator no lures not counting gyms or daily bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah stardust is catches thats easy in days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i frequently get in a day on weekends
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice research ill further extend this to reality people who have a life other than play pokemon per day pretty sure the average person only play hour at most and to gather item at pokestop so to get stardust takes of gameplay lets divided per day to into which would get your stardust this would take the average person about days at least and at most if heshe only plays hour per day keep in mind this does not including getting items from pokestop or drivingwalking to the pokestop location this could take up to per trip
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and then hours of grinding is spend on one pokemon from level to hahaha sorry im just traumatized by the lack of dustcost of upgrading edit getting pokemon from to and many trainers are above lvl now is hours of grinding you can finish a lot of games from a to z in hours we need that time for upgrades seems very grindy to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im more impressed you did it moving and what looks like without a plus if youre lucky enough to have access to those imbalanced lure spots it would have been a trivial task
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh so pokemon spawn every minutes at a lured spot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,every catch you get at least stardust s
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,analysis it takes me days izi
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is possible to earn dust in two days i used to earn between dust a day from the go only and driving around at mph it took about hours a day on a college campus i was using only the free incubator
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,go plus set to pokestops only rubber band trick manual catching would probably be best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to manage time and space efficiently i favorite only what should be kept the storage bag was expanded to handle at least more than the total number of favorites once or twice a day ill sort by favorite and scan new catches unfavorited for any surprises to favorite everything remaining gets transferred and the process takes just a couple minutes thanks to mass transfer and having everything grouped together when theres enough weedle pidgey and rattata candy ill stop transferring them and within a day have enouph for a luck egg my daily catch total is at least netting more than in stardust not bad for hours spent moving around with the go plus imagine what could be accomplished with endurance training
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id guess that you used a power pack but how do you maintain battery life for all that time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive found that stardust is achievable in a hard week if you keep gyms and play for at least miles around a day good to know that if you really want you can get it in a day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually just a tiny fraction of my dust comes from catching pokemon collecting from gyms every around per day and coinsday eggs hatched from a blue incubator for those coins one blue incubator costs coins and is good for eggs so every coins is worth an egg hatched dust i assume that one of the eggs will be a most likely say on average onetwo eggs and eggs hatched with the orange incubator lets say thats another dust average first catch bonus is dust and i maybe catch pokemon on average which is dust so in total i average at around dust a day out of which around comes from catching pokemon for dustcatch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do stardustday with the plus without great effort which is double than i used before the plus i work in a pokestoprich area with high density of spawn points i can hit pokestops with a walk early morning at lunch time and just before going home i catch pokemon with the plus while i spin most pokestops manually this also helps in not trying to catch that big snorlax with the plusthe plus prioritizes catching vs spinning my ratio of pokeballs usedcommon mons caught is also better with the plus on average it was even with great curve balls now down to i should have bought the plus before better investment than incubators if you are an urban player
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,two things with go plus op already said they had issues with pokéballs go plus catch rate is way worse than manual catching so they would need to refill inventory mor frequently wasting time all those pokémon take a lot of space you need to transfer and with go plus there isnt time to do it after catching you need to reserve blocks of time to go through pokémon appraise and transfer bad ones
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the only thing i dont like about the plus is the high flee rate and the use of only pokeballs thats why i dont have one and dont use one it would definitely be interesting what results the plus would bring with the same play style
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no i play without one i would have definitely moved around faster but at the cost of like more pokemon fleeing from me i am not sure what would have been better
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre spoiled with those rates p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here i average playing casually while walking and hatching eggs nonstop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you sit on gyms you get stardust per week from gyms and stardust per week from the first catch of the day so you can theoretically get stardust by playing minutes per day for days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,people who have a life other than play pokemon per day person with life here just thought id add that thanks to the plus im able to play pogo hrs a day all while having a normal life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how many level pokemon do you really need everyone ideally should have at least high level defenders to stick in gyms but for attackers you can easily get the job done with a bunch of strong pokemon that dont need to be level its good to have longterm goals in the game for players who are more hardcore than casual if you could max out your dragonite or vaporeon after hours of grinding wed all have multiple maxed pokemon and then there is not much else to do other than holding gyms instead i prefer having a small yet powerful squad of attackers ive invested precious dust into and i have a list of pokemon i want to power up later it gives me something to work at id agree that grinding for stardust is not the most ideal endgame activity but its something to keep us going until we get things like pvp battles or more interesting quests etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,augmented reality games are played for the playing sake there is no finish line to reach there is only certain mechanics to keep players motivated if you could upgrade your pokemon to easy so if dust would be easier to get you would have less incentive to do what this game wants you to do go out and play so in my opinion grinding is the wrong word here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not just upgrades huge upgrades
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont level up my pokémon above level is only stardust unless they are very very special and i have enough candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes they do a lure is basically pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so you walk a day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got my plus wed last week massive xp and stardust increase for my situation i live in a similar situation to you it sounds so if i was driving through i would just get stops but now i just click to catch everything else i avoided plus tracking all distance during the day ive been hatching eggs like crazy as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it depends what the pokestop distribution is like the plus also only throws one ball so if op is averaging balls per pokemon itd help cut down on that usage the biggest advantage to the plus is that you can multitask while youre waiting for the cluster to clear out you can be appraising the pokemon that you already caught if op transferred certain pokemon weedle pidgey caterpie spearow rattata at the very least without appraising that clears up a big chunk too but a plus definitely changes up how its done so thats why id be curious to see it done
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but you can still catch mons with go plus while youre clearing your space
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the plus is all about speed and xp you get throw and move on and you will either get or xp this conserves balls as well i have found the catch rate is better than manually if i throw regular ball i am positive i wouldnt be catching all the raticates and pidgettos that i wind up with daily the plus gives me way more xp and pokémon from when i otherwise wouldnt have had the app open to catch usually i can average xp per day when using it just by it self
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that first point is definitely arguable catch rate is definitely worse but catch rate per ball could be comparable and then if you consider the speed you can get through spawns it gives you more time to get to stops and spawns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the space argument is counter to this goal stardust means capturing pokemon egg dust so this goal is committed to getting pokemon catching faster and filling up bag completing goal in addition as others said you can clean and plus at same time cant manual catch and clean at same time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if op is catching every pokemon he or she sees for stardust doesnt the second bullet become moot youre still going have to appraise transfer manually caught pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,isnt there a way to make sure the plus catches everything it was found a few days ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,plus its easier to spin stops with the plus if youre in a heavy stoprich area the plus will be a godsend maybe you can even switch it around catch manually on the phone for better catch ratesaccuracy but spin stops with the plus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that seems like a really good rate how many eggs are you incubating at once basically all hatching eggs really seems like the most timeefficient way to earn dust probably the least costefficient though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you sit on gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you sit on gyms then your not an average player lol do you know how long it takes to take a gym or even try to get gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not normal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how many level pokemon do you really need while maybe not need it does make a difference the higher the level the more damage they can dish out and the less they receive per hit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i personally find the grind and reaching a goal or several goalsno matter how bigsmall a gratifying experience yes i could go on playing normally but its not just me to each his own man
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,amen to that i dont grind i play pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for many excluding dragonite lapras snorlax candy isnt the problem at all its stardust id gladly make another vapes with cp for gyms i have candy but the stardust allows me to make maybe or and then id rather make a first high cp alakazam for example to have a high cp of each kind of pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i actually often bike more than that but then the game doesnt count most of my biking distance the rest of the distance i get from gps drift
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats fair especially for the harder catches like raticate fearow pidgeys weedles however i rarely use go plus for anything but item farming and i earn around going to go plus wouldnt work since the city im in doesnt have that many spawns maybe boulder or san francisco residents can afford go plus vacuuming i have to be precise with my throws and get a better rate than less than
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont want to sound like an arrogant player but ive spent months learning how to curveball great bonus so unless the catch ring is orangered or red i rarely waste more than ball its also a nessesity for me since my city doesnt spawn a lot of pokémon so i have to be precise and not allow them to flee to progress at a constant rate im also not afraid to use great balls and razz berries to improve my chances to a pokémon i admit inv spaces and lots of pokéstops help here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes all nine eggs i had saved up many incubators from daily spins and boxes during the christmas holiday event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youre not in the minority team ie you are an average player and youre at least level ie the average silph road player
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,define normal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats what im currently doing im level but i have no pokémon above level but eventually ill want to max out my rhydon gyarados and the bestiv vaporeon for holding highcp gyms no way i can max out my dragonite lapras and snorlax without a lot of walking that can be better spent evolving more rhydon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i myself go to work by bike monthsyear and yes saddly i get nothing for this km day of commute but at least next summer ill have the pogo to catch things while biking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will admit i have become fairly casual with playing and just use it for traffic during the day or when i am in the car i see it as just a chance to get to the next mass evolve sooner plus that extra per day adds up if i decide to take a break from manually playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still takes way longer and theres always the chance that the pokémon will jump or attack once youve already thrown the ball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agree with you owning gyms just takes some patience luck and time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have my phone fixed on the handlebar and am slowly biking and catchingspinning stuff around but you need to choose your path in advance for that of course even i wouldnt do it on a busy road
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will fully agree that if your location can support this type of play style go for it if i did that id drop from pokémon caught in a day to because there is simply not enough spawns here to optimize time like youre suggesting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i grabbed the lock screen from ufearsomegalaxies and made my own inside home screen with all the widgets and apps laid out atop the sections then tapping the optical sphere launches the camera app d running on a galaxy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,would you be willing to share the image that you used for the inside of the dex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you need this httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomagentargopokeiconhlen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sweeeeeeeet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats awesome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is awesome thanks for creating it i pushbulletted your homescreen design to my phone right away cant wait to test it out with the pokedex lock screen d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the blue button later on should be the pokemon go button
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how were you able to do the camera thing i have an so i dont know if thats a specific thing or if i could also do this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i want it can someone please link me this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why would anyone ever assume that is a camera
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,alas designing them in means the gradients look a bit funny on imgur on a computer screen hardly noticeable on the phone though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how did you make the blue button link to the camera
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there ya go though ill be honest i tweaked it around to fit my just right and had to fiddle with the apps and widgets to get them to fit i can find a way to drop a psd if you have a deft hand with photoshop and want to make one that matches your devices layout
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw that and was pretty tempted would need to make a custom silph road one though d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im planning on putting it front and center on the screen section of the homescreen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use a nonstock launcher nova launcher that allows you to customize the icons of any app you have on the homescreen so i just made the icon for the camera mostly transparent and just have it sitting atop the graphic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first comment friend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,better than any other piece of its hardware who knows how the thing actually scans pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just so happen to have an so im good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,any chance you would have one to fit the i am not very handy with photoshop lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this one imo is better but they were pulled fairly quickly and updating for new apps stopped
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok thanks i am using that to make my apps look like pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man looks like the link to the icon pack is dead
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,check out the app poke genie
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpgoptimizfrenivcalculator it will show you your pokémons level it will also show you the dustcandy cost to power them up to the maximum for your level and at level the max level of a pokémon is above your level maxed out at level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the only true way to know is to power it up full bar means trainer level s or you could use an iv calc that works too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is exactly what i wanted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wrong pokemon will max out at pokemon level you get one power up at trainer level and thats it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokémons will max out at pokémon level which is obtainable with a player level because of the rule do you have a source confirming what you say
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the few people that hit already posted about it you can check that as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems like theyre just as hard as always caught some with ball others take
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i find them to be just as difficult as always
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a bulbasaur run on me seems same as always
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they seem to be about the same ive had a few run instantly a few caught by a poke ball and some giving me a hard time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i bet if the catch rate will ever be decreased niantic will announce itit will encourage more people to play
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats one instance i think you should try your luck on at least a few more encounters before you start getting too excited
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably just luck ive had a bulbasaur get caught with one great ball had another around the same level break out of about greats and one ultra ball others fluctuate with how many it takes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought exactly the same thing and better ivs on mine than normal spawns never caught a good charmander since the game launched and never hatched a charmander now i caught nine charmanders and all have ivs higher than caught attention and a wonder for team mystic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught my first five on the first ball and were by using regular pokeballs but then the next few were just as hard to catch as normal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good ivs same catch rate but a lot of charmeleons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my first charizard and blastoise ever just appeared in my house ruralsuburban area both ran away so so so disappointed and i just learned to throw perfect curveballs just for this reason
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i find it hard and unpredictable as usual sometimes it takes balls for a low cp pokemon other is exactly the opposite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charizard broke out of berry ultraballs with greatexcellent curveballs before escaping i can already feel the frustration build up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,while i think its really fun to find wild charizardsi cant get over the fact that this is just another cash grab by niantic to make us waste our greatultraballs and then buy more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,caught a charizard with the first ultra ball so i would say yes but then again i needed poke balls to catch a bulbasaur
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree caught a near max bulbasaur first try with a pokeball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed i wasted ultraballs on a single charmander
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ultras on a charizardhit two excellent throwsand it ran
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats just not right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gonna be sour about that one unless i get a higher cp during this event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the halloween level of candy would be broken if it were that way all the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,now that weve had free candy for a while and weve gotten used to it should we have more the buddy system fixed a problem and did it without breaking the game its fine the way it is if you find yourself in a situation where its just impossible to get enough candy to evolve a pokemon you have the buddy system to fall back to its supposed to be a backup not a main source of candy its already a game changer for rare pokemon like snorlax and lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think its perfectly fine the way it is really doesnt need a buff
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think the candy awards are just fine it would be nice to have a rare chance of something else perhaps some star dust with the candy or very very rarely a stat boost or an option for a move change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think buddy distance should be based on experience group fast mediumfast mediumslow and slow instead of hatching distance stronger pokémon are often on the slow groups and weaker ones are on the faster so the grindreward ratio would be more balanced they could go for example from to for a candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id like for there to be bonus candy at regular intervals say every normal candies or so rather than the current system where bonus candies seem random and not at all intentional
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the buddy system isnt meant to be a primary method of getting candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im greedy so of course i want more i feel halving the distance for candy is more reasonable or even making it alternatively or additionally i would love bonus candy at specific distances like at exc i would also like to see the buddy role expanded a little like displaying your buddy next to you on the map or maybe attack a pokemon you are trying to catch to make it easier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i remember a time when we didnt even have the buddy system im content with this even though its so slow to grind up my dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,he only change i wish i had was the opportunity to have a pokestop as a buddy i am out of pokeballs and unfortunately dont have the spare time to sit at a pokestop in the near future
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would prefer a shift back closer to the halloween event distances if theyre worried about people gaining candy too fast then lower the cap per day from to for example andor do the current distances instead of the buddy system felt incredibly rewarding as there was noticeable progress towards improving a pokemon it is also the only realistic way to power up ultrarare pokemon like lapras where its not possible to go find nests etc and i felt it was an equalizer between people who chased rares via scannerstwitter feeds and those who went out and just walked a lot playing the game normally
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its fine the way it is it wasnt meant to be a sole supply of candy youd still be expected to find that same type in the wild and from eggs its merely a small supplemental tool and additional bonus for those that are getting out and walking instead of camping triple lure spots
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im fine with the way it is not going to complain if they buff it tho something that would be nice is to increase the chance of finding candies based of distance walked with that buddy ie after km with a buddy you have a chance of finding candies or even a little stardust not sure what levels would be fair nothing too drastic but something to reward people for walking a long way with one buddy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the candykm should most definitively not be buffed its way too easy to get rare pokemon as it is i would like to see an extension of the buddy system though where you would get rewarded for using your buddy in battle added possibility to boost your buddys stats as long as he remains your buddy etc etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would like to see it being used for generating tms something like this upon choosing your buddy you pick between candy or tm pick candy and it works exactly as it does today pick tm and you can chose one of the two moves from your buddy to be extracted to a tm with the following costs for quick moves damage x km so water gun would cost for example vine whip karate chop etc for charge moves damage x number of bars km so solar beam would cost km body slam km water pulse etc or some other variation of this such as damage x km so low damage moves cost much less than high damage ones your tm will then only be useable on pokemon that can learn the same move in the game so i could walk my charizard with dragon claw and use it on my dragonite or my cross chop psyduck and use the tm on my machamp id be pretty happy with that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it needs some sort of adjustment or more reward than just candies i got my venusaur solely from walking a bulbasaur i hatched back in level i walked over km with my bulbasaur to get a venusaur
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they should double the stardust remove the speed limit allow us to delete eggs make max revives more common give us candy make leveling faster allow nests with ultrarare pokémon give dragonitelaprassnorlax to whomever doesnt own one already free incubators every week free coins every day game breaks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like this idea think it would help balance it a bit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the buddy system was never intended as a replacement to catching pokemon for candies and it shouldnt be one the halloween distances were nice but if we had them all the time it would almost make the game too easy over the course of a week i managed to fill every evolvable spot in my pokedex aside from charizard if we had this kind of reward system all the time it would be very easy to finish the pokedex in just a few weeks or a month or two do we really want this the point of rare pokemon is that they are rare you arent supposed to have maxed out versions of every top tier pokemon within a month or two of starting the game in my opinion its much more rewarding to know you tracked down dozens of abra to get that newly buffed alakazam that you walked your snorlax for weeks to max him out and that you had that little charmander as your buddy for long kilometres to get your charizard tldr the buddy system isnt the only means of evolvingpowering up and its rewards should reflect that and therefore dont need to be buffed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would be up for that im about to pass km with my snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax used hyper beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,understood and ive waffled back and forth on what i feel like a more ideal distance would be ill admit my perspective comes from someone who completed the pokedex months ago and before the halloween event and whose primary interest in the game is gym battlingterritory control it also comes as a result of there being only two ways to currently keep up with the joneses with respect to gym cp creep and those are travel miles to farm the one spot that reliably produces any dratini or follow twitterrun a scanneretc and drive around madly chasing rares as they spawn having a buddy system that actually competed with those options made it easier to stay competitive without needing to spend hours commuting daily to a farming spot or engaging in tosbreaking rare chasing and i walk a decent amount on a dragonite on a lapras on a grimer etc and am proud of those improvements i just would like to see the go part of the game emphasized more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tosbreaking methods should not be a good comparison so just ignore that part as for spending hours commuting daily to a farming stop if the buddy system helps you compete with that level of dedication then its obviously too op of course those people should have the advantage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you have any questions i can maybe answer i do what is the point of this thread
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,level and you think the leveling is slow wait till you get to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exp is just about exp of lvl
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,showing that you can play for a short period and still catch up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lmao i giggled
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh but you didnt catch up youre at exp and youll need almost double that on top of what you already have to reach million exp your only decent pokemon is that lvl lapras you had the luck to hatch take note that i in no way want to underestimate what youve already done thats way faster and better than what i had at but you have an extremely longer road ahead than you have behind
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats just less than two months left not a big deal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had the same issue a couple days in a row it just fixed itself as now im getting credit for distance walked one thing is your gps a little goofy like does the moving too fast thing popping up i may be paranoid however maybe if you breech that speed threshold it just nixes any progress that is all i noticed was that the warning was highly sensitive and overreacting right on start up my phone is a cheap aquios its gps is pewp thus i get the going too fast a lot even when walking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow sounds a lot frustrating ive never had an issue with egg distance sorry i cant help al i can say is distance is calculed every min and added every mins to counter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had this issue and when i put another egg in an incubator it started working again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try clearing your cache and data files then restart you will have to login again and go through the permission prompts i suggested that to another player where their egg distances just wouldnt update because in game gps was all wonky despite playing with various settings
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a galaxy and it sometimes will randomly tell me im not supposed to play while in a car when im standing still so maybe thats something to do with it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,completely unrelated but i thought your flair said murica spain
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tried this about six times over a couple days to see for the most part unfortunately it didnt work one time it did update a little when i opened it the one is now at instead of but still stuck ive tried clearing the data since then and no dice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hatched a tyrogue with perfect iv when i appraised him it said his best quality is his hp er what if it has ivs it would say all three stats are the best not just hp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are wrong either it is not or if you click further it will say it is matched equally by its defense and then it is matched equally by its attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true so it would be a chance of getting a hitmontop for hitmonlee and of hitmonchan
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,let me clarify i got his stats two different ways pokegenie had ivs when i had it appraised by my trainer on pokémon go he said its best quality is its hp that is what i am stating best quality being hp should hitmontop but i guess not in this case
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used pokegenie and the in game trainer appraisal how do you get the stats of your pokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes it did mention all three but it said hp first oh well now we know thanks for the advice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im just stating exactly what happened to try and informhelp others its best quality is its hp its attack is great too its defense is great too its stats are the best ive never seen no doubt about it and it evolved into hitmonchan actually i have never appraised a pokémon where the trainer said it is matched equally maybe you are wrong and need to check your facts bud
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when you appraise a pokemon and its itll always list hp first then attack and lastly defense if it only list hp then its not really
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the actual text you see depends on your team httpspokemongogamepressggpokemonappraisal so the mystic text says it is matched equally by its the equivalent for instinct is its is great too both mean exactly the same that the twothree stats are equal and are the best out of the three stats again as mentioned by others if your pokémon has ivs there is no need to use any iv program you can read it from its appraisals you have a pokémon if and only if the in this case instinct appraisal says that its best quality is its its is great too then again its is great too guaranteeing that all three values are equal and at the end its stats are the best ive ever seen no doubt about it guaranteeing that the stats are so if it is then all three stats are equal and the tyrogue randomly evolves into one of the three hitmons we dont know yet whether in this case all three possibilities are equally likely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it mentioned all three but said best quality is hp thanks for the info
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gotcha had no idea that different trainers said different things good info donno how i made it to level before silph road and the community on here thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a park in boston that used to be a vulpix nest split into a ponyta and growlithe nest after the migration for me not complaining cause i need growlithes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,some of the larger starter nests were split into multiple nests
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the main nest near me used to be ponyta and has now split between clefairy and growlithe its a park that is split into two main sections that do appear as separate sections on maps but are connected and used to have ponyta in both areas now the northern section is only clefairy and the southern area is only growlithe guess which section ill be walking in now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice i wouldnt mind a growlithe nest unfortunately there are only a few nests around my area and i only got to visit one on my day off gotta go south about miles to an old dratini nest that converted to a kabuto nest and a pikachu nest in my area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting my ponyta nest is now clefairygrowlithe ditto on the growlithes super excited for this weekend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn that sucks especially since all the above pokemon i listed are pretty common for my area there was a pikachu nest around here as well but i didnt have a chance to visit it due to rain hoping its something better now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id be walking in that clefairy nest to gain catches towards the badge ive had at most like arcanines already x
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my large pikachu nest became two smaller nests one cubone and one kabuto i was a little sad id not caught more pikachus only found it a week before the migration although i have noticed them three or four times in a park nearby so im hoping thats a new nest need to make time to go check it out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah im kind of pissed about it as well i didnt take advantage of the pikachu nest near me as i was trying to build my pokedex and get candies for other pokemon im still working at the pikachu fan badge side note ive caught near magikarp and im only sitting at xl magikarp caught for the fisherman badge as well as xs rattata and almost candies for the youngster badge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the only other thing i can think of is that safetynet also does an unlocked bootloader check which i dont think would be undone with just a factory reset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess people on rpokemongodev have more information for you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks man i didnt find this info anywhere else but how do i restore bootloader status
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,samsung has software that can allow you to flash the stock recovery once you connect the phone to your pc via usb im not sure im allowed to link external sites here but xda should have a forum for your specific device
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah cool so i should search how to flash stock recovery thanks man
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess you better flash the whole stock rom with wiping user data if recovery only wont help
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats fake at on the right you can see where he missed the photoshop and the gyarados is blue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im skeptical
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i give this a couple more hours until neckbeards parroting this as fact
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fake the name after evolve change to red gyarados it should be red karp just like before he evolve it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just tried it its fake gyrados was just as blue as the first
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just tried it on a throwaway bot account its fake
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dang i just made mine days ago otherwise id test magikarp to go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,union bank sponsored niantics other game ingress a couple months back niantic turned on these sponsored union bank ingress portals in pokemongo to increase the amount of pokestops whats somewhat strange is that ive never seen a union bank gym they seem to only be pokestops unless someone can confirm otherwise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is one of those on coronado island in san diego too i was very surprised i have also seen restaurants with pokestops and if you click on them it tells you about them one has been there since the beginning of the game so maybe it was like that before pokémon go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,click on the pokestop does it say sponsored on the top right corner
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does not if you go to the imgur link it shows description its just an odd pokestop that recently popped up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,union bank stops were added a few months ago to all of the union banks near me like august or september even but this was before sponsored stops were a thing so they werent tagged
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wrong sub
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im pretty sure op posted it there as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a very old visual glitch theres nothing hidden in it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty sure it is a known bug and doesnt mean anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this glitch has been known in the game since close to release its an issue with the graphics engine they use not the game itself no one has yet found any hidden information in it its probably just pure garbage text
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks i hadnt seen it before 😄
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same thing here or it is at least not showing up in the text could it be that it only increase probability to catch now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just wanted to share that the silph road radio is actually intended for this function as well it is a locationbased realtime text communication system built into the silph web app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,many here in italy prefer telegram or hangout hope that the silph road app has most of the telegram features like create group chats linking positionss and images ecc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats cool but i just want you to know that there are also several discord channels being used for that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bbbut the silph radio its going to be amazing right right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is this real im very gullible right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for telegram
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have not heard of this ill try it out thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just want to throw in slack thats what we use for ingress and ive already started one for my local yellows lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely true mate check out the side bar tests have already been done believe everything udronpes says vote dronpes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,make sure what ever app you pick has a large room size in ingress the our resistance group cant use things like google hangouts because theres too many people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i volunteer to receive this bug in order to do some further testing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my two pokemon are in invisible gyms that is a total different story
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this game is already buggy af so it better be buggy enough to give me this glitch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here i left a charizard like weeks ago in some gym in my city the gyms last at least days plus big city in méxico
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mybe try putting another pokemon in that same gym and see what happens
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe gym cleanup is done on a background thread so you do not get your pokemon back in real time but when their background processing stuff gets to it if for what ever reason their background thread is behind a bit it will take longer for the pokemon to leave the gym and become fainted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that just happened to me weird
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh its just a cross haunter dnight mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here i havent seen my charizard in at least weeks i cant remember where i left it tho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does this just last for a matter of minutes while you stand there watching i have seen delays like that in getting a defender back before but i never saw it continue for hours and days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is common but not for a long time i had it happen but the delay was just about half an hour never more than that its weird have you tried using other pokemon in that gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a similarish glitch occur with the same pokémon im mystic with a dragonite and the gym changed to valor last night i was able to cash out my coins again this morning a good hours earlier than my hour allotment i know for a fact i cashed out last night because i cash out at the same time as my family and used the stardust immediately
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your gym icon is yellow thats a strange glitch it should be red or blue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im having the same issue as well also with a dragonite idk how to get it back or how it happened is there a fix to this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looks like other people are having the same problem from the other place
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and i will be the representative of the south
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,please elaborate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you mean the charizard is still there after the gym is taken over by a rival team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the background cleanup is a good assumption but that should only account for a small delay somehow the record is getting lost but then gets found again as an implimentation detail pokemon never actually transfer to the gym the pokemon in the trainers box gets marked as being in a gym and a clone of that pokemon is created just for the gym it has to work this way because of the distributed nature of the servers when a mon in a gym gets kicked out the clone would be marked as defeated and an event would be queued up to synchronize the status of the gym mon with the trainers record if something goes wrong with this step the event gets lost and the synchronization never happens until some interaction at the gym triggers another event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im going to study the behavior of this dragonite the next several times i use him and see if i can get more information will update this thread if i find anything new
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what species pokemon is it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,during the current gym meta my dragonite typically defends gyms that last between minutes to a few hours as they are flipped so often but twice i observed that the moment i got my dragonite back coincided with the moment the gym got taken over a second time possibly the earlier occasion in budapest may have lasted days or weeks but i wasnt there to know what team held the gym during the duration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i observed it twice in person in two different gyms i used different pokes in one of those gyms but only the dragonite experienced the bug i think i will make more observations to get a firmer picture of things its hard to time how long the pokemon is delayed without being in the area and watching the gym to know when it is flipped by a rival team twice unless you are in an area where gyms flip back and forth fairly frequently the occasion yesterday was in a shopping mall it was an instinct gym with an open slot i got it up to lvl with another open slot right at the time i left the mall to go to an appointment nearby i noticed that the gym was now lvl my dragonite was a goner for sure and i was minutes from collecting my gym reward then i saw the gym flip to red nothing i could do to flip it back i had an appointment to go to but checking my store i saw that there were still five pokemon in gyms and the dragonite still had the yellow gym symbol the gym was on the outskirts of the map view so i watched it continuously to see what will happen as well as checking the store with the clock ticking down then i saw with just a few minutes left on the clock the number of defenders went down to and sure enough when i checked the map the gym had gone right back to instinct and the dragonite was there in my bag waiting to be revived then i remembered this happened to me before at another gym when i got the same dragonite back when the gym got flipped a second time the two other times were at a gym near my house one i was able to observe when it got flipped a second time the other i know i didnt get the dragonite back when the gym was taken over but i didnt see whether the gym got flipped again when i got him back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you know if the gym has switched sides at least a second time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you know if the gym has switched sides at least a second time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the game was not officially released in my country sri lanka we were playing the game with apk installation and there were two my pokemon on the gyms on july niantic set geo block to whole south asia by geoblock niantic made pokemongymspokestops invisible when i go to my pokemon list it still show two of my pokemon are still on the gyms i can collect coins and star dust daily also we are waiting to release the game since then now it is days i think i have record to keep pokemon in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the gyms probably got removed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no apparently the gym was taken down but my charizard didnt came back but in my game appears as if it were in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes this is the important question umikehaufen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think your issue is not a delay itself but some kind of other bug when i have a delay the pokemon is still showing in the gym in my bag but in the actual gym its not there however when i try to collect the coins lets say i had pokemon in the gym and was delayed it would only let me collect coins even when it says in the collecting shield icon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes its a gym in town so it changes pretty quick its a sponsered gym too so idk if that has anything to do with it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and my bow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does incense spawn anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oops what happens to the pokémon affected by such a change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they get hidden not removed which is why they stay in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds like a similar bug do you collect gym rewards on that lost charizard do you know if that gym you left it in is stagnant or if it gets flipped between different teams back and forth
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lapras it lasted like min until i was able to revive it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and my nexus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,people seem to have gotten mixed results some people got their pokemon back after a couple of days others after a month some not at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when it happened to me our team got to cash out on it for a couple of days then our pokémon came back fully healed which was nice because i half expected them to be at hp happened before the ko glitch was fixed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,removed from the map was what i was trying to say
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i kept collecting rewards on that charizard but it wasnt in the gym that was a long a ago now ive lost a vaporeon maybe it has like week i still collecting the reward and the gym has changed back and forth
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you know if the gym your lapras defended got taken over a second time the moment you got the lapras back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the gym is the closest to my home i can see it from there so at the moment i checked when i arrived it had switched color so i freaked out when i couldnt revive lapras checked again minutes later and it had switched colors again so at that time i was able to revive him
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds very much like my situation now see if it happens again with your lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,worst possible dragonite moveset on offense mediocre on defense however its still a dragonite so if it has good ivs you can power it up and it will be a useful gym defender anyway due to its sheer cp total allowing it to sit on top of gyms and not get kicked out by shavers and casuals
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sucky but he still has a high cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i kill blisseys pretty easily with my level sw hb dragonite the worst moveset but dragonite is dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not that great on offense but for defense its ok the only thing that really matters when you put a dragonite in a gym is its cp and while on paper a dragonite with hyper beam is inferior to an hurricaneoutrage one in reality the dodgenotdodgedierevive loop bug makes hyper beam a real pain for the attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hyper beam is useless on defense unless you happen to misjudge the dodge it happens cold weather finger sticks kid used your phone and got food on it squished dead bughappened the other day etc give it a good test drive battling some gyms and see if you like i know you get a dragonite you want dragon moves but hyper beam on offense is one of the best moves in the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this my dragonite and both of my gyarados have bottomtier movesets but theyre still my star gym defenders movesets really dont matter all that much on defense especially if you aim to sit at the top of gyms cp is king
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not too worried about offense but he does have pretty good ivs edit if only hyper beams werent so easy to dodge x
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice do you leave it in gyms to defend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it feels like the worst on defense too dragon tail hits harder than steel wing and hyper beam is easier to dodge than hurricane and easier to predict than outrage i have two with this moveset they stay on gyms because of their high cp not their ability at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,luckily at the moment it doesnt matter if it gets dodged or not theyre still very likely to initially take the damage and the deadnot deaddead loop is very effective at running the battle timer down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did but its not good at defending imo just dragonites are good defender sw dc legacy and dt hurricane hurricane and dc are so hard to dodge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hyper beam is one of the few charge moves that ive never noticed cause the false dodge faint loop thank god
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen someone post one like this before but with different skin color and clothes as terrifying as ever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre in the upsidedown now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is the control center
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one known cause is if you used incense in an area with no biome or spawn points nearby commonly done for finding rare pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,those pokemon were caught in areas without associated biome data and niantics programmers havent figured out how to omit empty fields
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get city united kingdom all of mine are like this with an obvious gap not sure whats meant to go in the second spot is it used for state in the us if so should probably be west midlands or warwickshire here pretty sloppy that it doesnt suppress empty fields though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive had the same issue with pokemon i caught in key west florida a while back they all say no citystate and they were not from incense as i had none during the trip
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all my newport beach and san francisco pokémon are listed with a blank state so certain cities just have issues apparently
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,each pokemon has a gps location attached to it to know where it spawned niantic is using some database to get the data to show this database might not have a correct location for the gps coordinates nothing special happens all the time as maintaining a dataset of all citiesregionscountries with exact gps coordinates is hard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what motivates someone to continue to play will vary based on each individual when i hit level a few months ago september i had already completed my regional pokedex i was able to collect on gyms a day i decided there wasnt really much to do at that point after a few days i started thinking about getting the gold medals just for fun i also wanted to power pokemon up but was tight on stardust i went to nests went to rivers etc i kept hatching eggs for dust and trying to get higher iv pokemon than i had too pretty soon my xp bar was halfway to without worrying about it so decided to go ahead and level up to i decided that would be it though at i thought maybe level would be a little better since i wanted to power up my pokemon a little more i had all the type medals by halloween and all the others but the three harder ones fisherman youngster and pikachu i was close to by the time of the double xp event so thought why not make it a challenge and see how much xp i could get i was well into level by the end of the event now i was done but for the three medals nothing to play for otherwise but then i could see i was close to level so why not just finish that off so hit level and said that is it no way i am going to grind the ridiculous million xp to get to still needed to finish the medals though the next holiday event meant more catching and getting better iv starters movesets i was missing etc i had to hatch a lot of eggs to get the babies as well pikachu medal was close after the event hit nests to finish the pikachu medal and others to power up the now viable rhydon and golem hmm i was already well into level so might as well grind to while working on finishing fisherman and youngster plus hatch eggs since i was still missing togetic so i hit level yesterday and am completely done except for togetic and short tiny rattata and big magikarp and did want to power up my omastar so need to farm omanytes at a local nest then i am done give it a few days or a week and see if you have things you want to complete or do small goals can end up leading to the next and the next to keep you interested if not just take a break until
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so what do i do now get in gyms and max out your permanent upgrades
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the xp system is designed with the casual player in mind if you stretch it to levels hardcore players like most of us that frequently visit this subreddit would be way too far ahead of those that only play once in a while or on their way to work if pokémon levels are tied to trainer level like they are right now casual players would effectively be locked out of gyms and unable to catch up because the hardcore players would still keep on leveling up yes its tedious to grind more levels when you reached but it makes sense if you dont want to alienate the casual player base i agree though that the rewards for leveling up past are really underwhelming while it makes sense to give out shop items like lures incenses etc on every level from past every levelup feels like a huge accomplishment and should totally reward some of those shop items if one of each feels too much niantic could still give out like lure incense at lucky egg incubator at etc etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my thoughts about xp if you play any game a lot you should be rewarded by increase in your skill knowledge that should come naturally i dont like games that also give you a huge advantage over other players just because you put in a lot of hours i love pogo xp system a lot since it is reasonably easy to reach level in a year which unlocks all the items and wildencounter cp but it makes sense to keep going past that to achieve a slight advantage in gyms i dont mind levels stopping at as your total xp continues to grow regardless if you want to brag about big numbers regarding future goals niantic will periodically add content to keep you busy genders in the meantime trainer level by itself is as arbitrary a goal as any some other ideas hold more gyms max storage get a mon with more than cp my max is collect of each type preferably with ivs get all the medals collect km eggs then hatch them in minutes run meet more local players organize outplay spoofers not sure if possible but something to aim for perfect your gym strats optimize your time and potion efficiency
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i reached level in december completed goals reaching level collecting from gyms daily jogger gold medal my strategy is now no more xp grind because i dont see any added value in leveling up past no increase in highlevel wild catches very expensive powerups with half cp increase that means free slots in my pokémon storage because i dont need to save them for mass evolving and that means the freedom of evolving something immediately instead of waiting for next weeks mass evolution maintaining permanent gyms on average per day falls so i have to replace it thanks to my highquality prestigers and much more averagequality prestigers and defenders actually gym holders i only need dragonite chansey and aerodactyl plus a few easy evolutions to complete the kanto pokédex so im just hatching eggs hoping for the lucky one and meanwhile im walking rhyhorn to evolve an army of rhydon not walking dratini because i can get walked rhydon for each walked dragonite im actively trying to get as many gold medals as possible except for dragon tamer and fisherman where ill settle for silver i hope to get all the other medals by the end of the year other fun goals taking down longstanding gyms trying to be on the top of the gyms closest to my home and workplace maxing out unusual pokémon like sandslash or jynx defeating a dragonite with an onix making more spreadsheets to optimize stuff and meanwhile gen ii will get rolled out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im level i think there are few different buckets for what can motivate people be a collector eg get all pokemon with the best ivs or the best movesets or the highest cps something beyond just completing the pokedex reach for higher levels aim for level one day be a gym master see how many gyms you can stay in work on having the best attacking defending and prestiging teams possible for every occasion this often involves spreadsheets and lots of optimizing these have some overlap but in my experience peoples personality types usually place them clearly into one of those motivational categories all of them are difficult goals imho and not easily reached people who arent interested in any of those goals or who had a simple complete the pokedex goal sometimes will stop playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a lvl trainer with a yesterday completed finaly dex the thing that drives me now is to keep a minimal of gyms a day for as uphilkendowels mentioned max out my bag space and storage also trying to have the strongest pokemons for the glory of being the best in town but the grinding gets more of a chore with each day one day ill hope to reach lv but i think it would take at least a year form now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hit level this week what keeps me playing is competing with my fiance and completing the pokedex he is also level but about xp ahead of me and for the pokedex all i have left is aerodactyl hitmonlee dotrio and machamp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first i think your tldr isnt actually accurate as it seems to me you are suggesting that there should be more levels but lower xp requirements to get to each level second i actually agree with this granted im only level but the xp requirement increases from level to level seem absurd if i have to gain million xp id much rather it be spread over levels than for example its more satisfying in my opinion they could even reduce the payout on reaching each level so that there would be no difference overall
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i reached level yesterday and indeed its a bittersweet feeling im currently only missing lapras and dragonite more km to go on my dragonair buddy and most of the babies which i dont care much for only have togepi and its gonna be my next buddy im definitely not as excited to play as i was say two or three months ago but i still keep the game running in my pocket whenever i gotta walk somewhere im not much of a gym player cause its impossible to hold gyms in my city for longer than a few minutes so the only mons i care to max out are my favorite ones anyway ive had a lot of fun with this game exploring my city meeting new people getting that rush of adrenaline when i opened the app one time at my workplace just to find a snorlax sitting there its been a great time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just hit a few weeks back i installed the game because i wanted to use my own itch to collect things to motivate me to get some exercise it works pretty well i dont particularly care to train or battle at gyms i mostly just gather pokemon at this point i am only a few shy of completing my regional pokedex but what keeps me going is wanting to get better ivs and different movesets even though wisdom says not to improve pokemon beyond around level i will probably also feel compelled to increase my highlevelgood offensive moveset pokemon just to have the best especially in the case they finally implement local battling which i would be much more likely to do with my friends
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im now lvl and i havent changed my gameplay much since lvl i enjoy grinding for xp and the gym scene where i live is super competitive and that motivates me to keep leveling up i am somewhat limited in gyms in terms time and distance as i bike and not drive so i usually collect from only gyms daily hopefully i can increase that up over time my goals now are to get rid of my glut of excess garbage mons so i will have space for gen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like the exp system levels actually mean something level is far away from level and i like that because there is something to actually look forward to with hard work i believe its levels so they can eventually expand all the gens to get to level or something what i see niantic doing is a seasonal release that is having a gen release every summer where everyone is playing pogo every summer another way to motivate yourself to level to is having a high max cp or just being better than all of your team contemporaries theres one level in my city that is at the top of every single valor gym with like cp in the gyms i personally get motivated because my girlfriend plays too and she actually gets me motivated because she likes comparing her stick with mine and i want to just keep ahead have a friend to compete against and thatll help you motivate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got to back during the double xp event i slowed way down playing for a little over the holidays im about of the way to now and the past couple weeks i have gotten much more into the gym game trying to work my way up collecting coins in a day im trying to add one gym a day and i lose one every couple days so im currently at i believed that once i completed my na gen dex id probably be done ive added charmeleon charizard and muk of the i needed since reaching level but the last one still evades me aerodactyl so maybe ill be done once i complete it but until that happens ill keep going with the gyms and work on medals only at on the dragon medal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was at a spot where i lost motivation last september and didnt play for almost weeks the halloweenevent was the reason i started playing again i was at level and my pokedex wasnt full but there were only rare pokemon missing and that alone didnt motivated me enough to keep on playing first it was the series of events that kept me playing the double xp and stardust event made me reach level that was the time when leveling became my new goal now at level my motivation to keep on playing is still leveling up i want to reach level at the end of march the goal is to power up my defenders and hold more gyms what happens after that i dont know i hope until then shinies breeding and gen will be released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe not germane to the ops post but i dont find keeping gyms satisfying at all i find it satisfying taking down stagnate gyms from other teams who feel they can sit there for weeks in my town mrpokescom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if they raised the level cap lots of games do that im level and i mostly play to fill out the pokedex and get high ivgood moveset pokemon and power them up i actually dont care much about xp anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought i was done at and then i thought i was done again at and i just hit an hour ago and now i feel done again ha ha like others have said the medals are a fun thing to focus on after hitting medals maxing your best pokemon and stable gyms another thing though is to remember its perfectly okay to take a break now and then you dont have to get to for a while at level i just stopped catching the common pokemon walked right past some of them and only bothered with rares it was refreshing then i stopped playing totally for a few weeks and it was nice to have the break actually the holiday events pulled me back in but now that its pidgeys r us again out there well im taking another little break as of right this second now that i hit a new factor for me is impassable sidewalks i really like playing in freezing temps actually but then we had major snowfalls in a row that never got cleared from the sidewalks and its now this thick compacted bumpy ice sheet that is really really difficult to walk on safely ive been slipping and sliding all over so i went and got a gym membership yesterday first time since pogo came out that i had to retreat indoors for a workout instead of walking or jogging inside but theres a pool and classes and stuff and it was actually kinda fun at the gym im thinking i might well rotate away from pogo for a few weeks ill be back for gen tldr its ok to take a break
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try ingress levels are much harder i made it to level before pogo came out and it has a lot of the features missing in pogo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,level goals grind stardust and hopefully remember to spend it keep up with local gym group for pokécoins for the chance to hatch a porygon increase the level cap for my mon so i can power up ususual mon to stick in gyms as in i can power up a golem to once im level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is pretty motivating only reading it im also doing some medals but im far form getting them all to gold currently im focussed on getting the ace trainer medal to gold next will be the miles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol very similar experiences for me virtually every single lvl since i thought that the xp required for next levelup was ridiculous different things motivate different people the three other things that kept me going tho were increased pokemon spawn ratesquality nests maxing out favorite mons i like catching mons the increased ratesquality made the game so much more fun at different times i had actually drove an hour to locations with heavily lured pokestops and varied mons with the game changes this is no longer necessary ive also found nests to be alot of fun also a challenge to see how many candieshigh ivdecent movesets for certain mons and everyone has particular mons they just like for whatever reasons have fun with that keep walking playing the xp will take care of itself if you can convince yourself to get excited abt pidgiesweedlespies all the better i need abt mil xp for lvl however gonna still need over a hundred carps for the fisherman badge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what keeps me going are the following things a war between my local valor group and some mysticinstinct players leveling uplevel but not in a rush to level up more rare pokemon hunting waiting for gen and my lord and savior totodile
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,almost my exact experience my playing has gone in waves and im glad i did it this way first i completed my regional in sept or oct then i got more involved in gyms and trying to collect as much as possible and train a ton once i had steady revenue i went for the medals over for dragons fish and rats my remaining and last week my plus arrived from amazon which is already changing the way i keep my bag stocked and i can attempt to catch additional pokémonday yup still need togepi
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as others already said motivating indeed thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man but you are so close need to hit to cap out of your pokemon then you can say you are done
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol this is so true i remember when i hit and was going to stop grinding and doing mass evolves hahahhahaha nothing incentivises you like seeing the level progress get to after weeks of not really caring that much and little goals like farming a very specific moveset on a specific mon stringing you along im not too far off myself if i wanted to push it i dont yet not in the final stretches
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i manage to get in gyms per day thats the limit since there arent many gyms around and sadly many of them are controlled by spoofers or by people with multiple accounts once ill be done with my eggs i want to hatch at once currently need more to go ill probably save up money for permanent upgrades definitely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,collect km eggs then hatch them in minutes run this is going to be very interesting im currently at eggs and i started running days ago today i managed to run for i hope to reach the milestone soon usually i walk each day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,stretch goal get your entire top over cp im level and just mon away from it your last point is actually what drove me for at least a month building up a diverse prestige crew that covered all the relevant type match ups and common cp ranges and finding bubblestrat pairings which i rarely even use tbh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,every single team i reached a new level i always thought nah man im done with exp then i realize that i make exp each day and after some weeks im like cmoooon only until next level happy for your creatures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like number a lot especially the level gyms part id love to do that too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,re yup same here at i do still see some value in leveling but am no longer in any hurry so no need for lucky eggs and its way less aggravating choosing prestigers without having to scroll through pidgeys still powering up defenders and walking for hard to get candies and still having fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish you to reach your goals then gg with level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish you well also
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you gotta up your grinding if you wanna reach it in a year at current pace you are looking at years
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also level instinct here have not completed the dex yet though still missing lapras and i dont have gyms every day usually i hover around but we are the underdog here so its a bit difficult to find gyms that will last my goals now are to get all gold medals still missing jogger my phone doesnt track distance well breeder tiny rats big karp pikachu fan ghost ice fairy depot and dragon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if i have to gain million xp id much rather it be spread over levels than yeah you got my point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,go for those you will feel great after them d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if they keep the xp gain and the xp curve as is level seems pretty impossible
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i personally get motivated because my girlfriend plays too and she actually gets me motivated because she likes comparing her stick with mine and i want to just keep ahead my girlfriend plays too but not that much shes level and has walked less than i caught the rarest pokemons for her using my phone when im out otherwise her pokedex would be shameful haha we also live pretty far from each other so its not easy to organize the little time we have in order to play together
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you i think its great that you are focusing on one medal at a time they can all lead to other related goals as well you may find you wish you had more or different prestigers as you finish off the ace trainer medal which leads to to some other goal while you are working on your jogger medal at the same time thats what keeps me interested at least
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely travel to areas where your team is the dominant team and find some stable gyms at once is a good goal i also did that a few months ago and it was loads of fun to see them all hatch youll go through a long period of only having egg always a so thatll help you save up coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,however it sounds like if the max level was or like op suggested then leveling would probably scale equally to accommodate those higher level caps for example it would most likely be way easier to reach level but the grind from to could be when they exp amounts per level start getting crazy basically it sounds like op wants the option to level up more themselves and therein be able to earn more rewards differentiate themselves more and power up their pokémon more with the added consequence of raising the max level to a level that they themselves will probably not reach just like but exists none the less
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha for me it was chansey which i finaly caught in the wild
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,huh hadnt thought about it like that thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did literally just got my first dragonite and its a with dragon breathdragon pulse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well over years with this release cycle i think therell be enough time to catch up although i think pokegyms are going to be much more difficult to beat with like cp snorlax lol itll be tough to start out late tho so i see a flaw in my suggestion its still interesting though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah long distance relationships are tough ive been there and id much rather be doing other things with her if we have limited time together than playing pogo its okay though you can still find a local fb group for pogo or something theyre usually pretty nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,onix pinsir jynx magmar electabuzz scyther and eevee d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but also if you knew that the top level was would you go for it lvl sounds doable they are just playing with our minds
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i swear a pokestop right by a building where i meet times a week only drops chansey ive hatched about chanseys and all of my came from that stop i wasnt playing much so that was really the only stop i was hitting in that two day period i hatched in a row and then a soon after there is also a stop on my campus somewhere that consistently drops lapras i havent narrowed down which one it is yet i just know that when i get in certain areas i am much more likely to get certain hatches people can shout rng all they want but i am not buying it lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill pull up my screenshots just for you pinsir jynx pinsir praise pinsir magmar hitmonchan second to last pokemon i needed for na dex chansey lapras isdp though chansey and scyther this was after eevee got taken out of but otherwise pretty close lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not going for any level specificly i am just playing the game and leveling up by mass evolving if i got to level and the my exp bar started filling up some more as to show me that they added more levels past i would just still keep playing the game and leveling up as usual i may never hit but i will keep playing and slowly working my way there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know this is off topic but im on android and it will not let let me update to the new version any ideas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,set gyms to level caps add more gyms to compensate that way me isnt obliterating the geodude some dropped in a slot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id take that immediately hitmonchan and chansey are all i need from eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on android as well and the updates always show up in the play store a couple days after people start talking about them here not sure what why its delayed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive only ever worked with ios so i really dont know anything about android sorry bro
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolved my high cp rattatas to see didnt get hyper fang either i did get dig on most of them though instead of hyper beam i only had though its probably just rng doing its usual thing would need a bigger sample size its possible some moves have a higher chance of appearing but its probably still just pure luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry your sample size is small i also tend to keep higher level rattata for lucky egg sprees last time i did it basically all my raticate were over cp had a handful of each moveset anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,were all of these evolved at the same time seems even more unlikely none of them would get dig you sample of high cp raticates is only and your cut off of is arbitrary you could ask if you are less likely to get quick attack above since you have of those in a row and then bite in a rowso likely just chance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still have three raticates i havent ground up into candy hyper fang hyper fang hyper beam theyre all high iv if that makes a difference and level or i almost never get raticates with dig occasionally get hyper beam usually get hyper fang
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my highest cp raticate had dig i was disappointed until i realized that even the perfect moveset raticate would have immediately been exchanged for ratata candy as toward a evolution is of far more value in this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i read something recently that your pokemon id combined with randomness generates movesets and from my limited data here it seems like cp is the common denominator here high cp raticateshyper beam lower cpprobably hyper fang maybe for your id you get dig more frequently i also have pidgeots the lowest cp one knows hurricane the others ranging from know aerial aceair cutter all of my wigglytuffs know feint attackplay rough it doesnt seem like movesets are completely random and i think i found a clear pattern where certain levelcpiv thresholds unlock different movesets
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the low level ones definitely were and below while the higher ones are a mix of some i kept and some recently evolved with the lucky egg its possible i might have deleted high cp raticates with digetc but i dont recall doing that ill be more detailed in my next lucky egg spree
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bite and hyper beam is really good for prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont shoot the messenger just tellin it like it is all pokes other than dragonite are pointless in this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not super effective against anything though always better to train with a good type matchup for a bigger prestige boost and normal moves have no type advantage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonite is good for attacking but not much else he has inflated cp that makes people think he is way better than he is dragonite is not on the same level as snorlax or lapras probably put him on the slowbro vaporeon poliwrath arcanine level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh really guess id better transfer my lapras and all my snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,super effective is unimportant move set dps against that target is whats important raticate with bite and beam has a high move set dps generally thanks to a stab hyper beam and s rapid charge rate off bite bite being a half second move also means they dodge pretty well too and because they are common you can trivially build up a stock that you just dont transfer seriously give it a try sometime it can reliably beat similar cp for and usually more but because you have one every you can just dial down until you find that point whilst ideally you will have an optimal matchup at every cp level raticate makes an excellent fallback
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only if you need to in order to fill up your storage with dragonite theyre good to hold onto until then but make room when the time comes and keep a cp diglett too for and some krabbys for bubblestrat wham bam just like that youve won the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,super effective has some importance check out pokewinwin and you can see the best matchups for training against any given pokemon rarely any normal types on there and the lower your cp the more prestige you get
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have been seeing your username around you crack me up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agree to disagree
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah fury cutter sucks id use a bug type with bug bite gets you dps which already beats pound then if its super effective dps let me enlighten you is more than let alone the bonus you get from their type being not very effective wham bam thank you maam drops mic exits stage left screams ownage pure ownage from backstage you should have let me get away with agree to disagree now i no longer agree to disagree i just firmly disagree
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a anything can beat a anything as long as you dodge specials and dont have a massive type disadvantage threads like this are starting to annoy me a bit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you hear that pal you aint
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sadly my machamp has submission so still not doing well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonites are always better i only use dragonites in battle all other mons are a waste of energy for prestige i use bubblestrat im the best player i know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kabutops with mud shot stone edge is your lapras solution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nah with those numbers even a type disadvantage is fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also this you can make quick work of that lapras with you machamp a cp difference isnt anything to write home about it would be impressive if it was a or cp difference
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should still be able to make decent work with him
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like my poliwrath with submission vs lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,best defensive moveset at least if you want to put him in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,leave a comment if you use this on the downvote button shockingly no comments maybe because you all know im right and every nondragonite pokemon is pointless go flood niantics suggestion box instead of downvoting me dont shoot the messenger
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what pokemon impressively beats lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a voice of reason thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no son we also have our army of dragonites we just dont brag about them unlike you so here take my downvote again tata
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill second arcanine as the best counter that ive found i dont have fire fangblast only a fire fang with bulldoze so even without using the charge move my dog can take a lapras without too much trouble recently had to train with one for several fights
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so pokemon does a good job against lapras and people want to give this guy a hard time for suggesting using machamp let me ask thisif you dont have an arcanine what shall we suggest anyone with half a brain can point out that arcanine does well against lapras what do you tell people that dont have one forget attacking gyms that have a lapras try using your vaporeon or maybe we could point out that machamp is a pretty good match up against lapras for those few players that dont have an army of top tier pokemon at their disposal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,setting the enemy as lapras on the spreadsheet better counters than machamp excluding the obvious snorlax dragonite arcanine and other lapras are vaporeon slowbro blastoise poliwrath muk venusaur exeggutor omastar charizard flareon tentacruel then machamp p with karate chop cross chop its the best pokémonmoveset in the game against lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aha i interest you it seems prance along mortal you dont interest me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sorry but i dont put much weight in the spreadsheets all you did was crunched offensive numbers according to the numbers vaporeon is the answer to everything just get a team of vaporeons i dont object to some of those slowbro with psychic is obviously a good choice and a poliwrath with submission is what i have used much of the game i have also tried some of those and i know they dont work very well flash cannon on blastoise is a joke and flareon is a slow and annoying pokemon to use im just not going to use a grass pokemon against an ice one because i dont feel like dodging every attack no one has a high level muk i have omanyte candiescharizard might be a good optionbut no on tentacruel too if you are planning on dodging everything tons of pokemon are good options i know everyone on here is an expert at dodging so to that i say why not just use your tangela but in the real world machamp is a very viable option that requires minimum dodging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hope you get your dragonite soon bud
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not just offensive numbers defense stats and defensive type counters are taken into account and i have a high level muk p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure son whatever floats your boat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky you i have a muk but i caught him wild so his cp is only im kind of holding off on him for now because there isnt anything he excels against that i dont have an answer for im just not a fan of the spreadsheets im sure they are accurate most of the time there are reason tier pokemon are tier pokemon but it still doesnt account for many of the aspects in actually playing the game there is also the case of do you want to invest in a pokemon to counter a single pokemon being over level i can do that but a tentacruel to battle a lapras isnt exactly high on my list of priorities there is also that fun aspect if you want to go around with vaporeons you do you but my cp machamp does well against most lapras and snorlax with relatively little dodging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is with people and this equal level crap all the time who cares fun fact i am level and most people around here are or under it is not a fair contest my pokemon are simply higher in level my cp machamp is a higher cp than most lapras around here so what if he is at a higher level than those lapras should i simply select a lower level pokemon to make it more fair sure others will catch up to me but i will worry about that when it happens
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you were the one that brought up the levels
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not having a convo with the op im talking to you but you obviously need your gold star enjoy have a good nite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol whatever you say jr and obviously nothing beats a dragonite because it has the highest cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so nothing that is lower cp can beat dragonite if something of lower cp can beat dragonite your theory fails it is not always the pokemon with the higher cp run along
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i needed a tangela to complete the european dex hatched him today after months of searching i agree its been a good day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hes so elusive ive only ever got one hatched iv and perfect moveset though so i cannot complain
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lapel pins are the perfect merch theyre affordable look good and can go on almost anything you wear with how varied peoples gear and clothing is gonna be it would make a whole lotta sense to make them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if its anything like ingress people are gonna do that overtheshoulder creep every time they see someone with their phone out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sign me up that sounds excellent
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really liked these pins the best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i approve this motion o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id buy one definitely o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like this idea having a small identifier to recognize other trainers is smart
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think we will notice each other by waving our phones as we try to catch pokemon in ar mode
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,from what ive seen on the net customs pins go for about can each or so but fabric patches are sold for cheaper about that may be a route we wish to go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hate that i once had a guy creeping me in a car very disturbing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we need that to become a reality tt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was kinda hoping for more of a silph road one but i guess that works too edit i mean like a pin of the silph road logo would show not only are we playing pokemon go but we are also a part of this community not just ur everyday pokemon go player if that makes sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just bought mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me walks up to person waving phone around excuse me are you playing pokemon go person waving phone around no im trying to call god me walks away slowly well thats a bit of exaggeration but in reality catching pokemon isnt the only reason people wave their phones about js
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fabric patches you cant take them off and put them onto something else so easily pins you just unpin and pin onto something else nice simple and easy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when lapel pins are sold for its generally due to a highly limited run or theyve been homemade if the heads of silph were to bulk purchase a couple hundred at a time from custom pin sites they could easily be sold for bucks on a profit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure one of those would be cool too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would think he had weak reception trying to call anyone really why does calling god require waving your phone unless you have weak reception edit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not true use velcro
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on average it seems to work out to about give or take there are cheaper ones and more expensive per pin based on pins and that isnt for the cheapest options either so ye if they were sold for excluding shipping of course they would definitely make a nice bit of profit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was kinda exaggerating a crazy person but sure whatever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then i need to make sure everything i wear has at least suitable surface to attach the velcro to whereas a pin just pin it into place and done
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,d well then imagin it the other way around then the random person approaches you hey are you trying to call god too me nah im catching pokemon the other guy what a weirdo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ye thats a very real threat too sadly tt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i only throw curveballs and i can confirm the curve is more pronounced now ive also heard the ball curving by itself bug is gone though this is unconfirmed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i think they made it easier to throw further this in turn screwed me over as i keep hitting the top of pokemon head and missing my great or even nice throws
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,confirmed here as well sucks since i essentially have to relearn how to curveball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea it seems that curve balls have been changed really annoying lost a lot of great balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,welleither my flick strength has increased from all the playing or they moved the pokemon closerchanged sensitivity
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does throwing a curve ball actually credit you with a curve ball throw now nothing was more infuriating than bending a pokeball like beckham and it not registering and then throwing it perfectly straight on the next pokemon and its counted as a curve ball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont have to spin the ball now either you can just swipe your finger in a c shape and itll curve the ball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just to back up the autocurveball thing i used berries on a redlevel pokemon and didnt have a single autocurveball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can confirm the curve is more pronounced now i would agree with this personally i think it makes throwing curveballs easier but theres no question in my mind that its different
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am consistently getting xp credit for my curveballs now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its easier to get distance i think im consistently overshooting pokémon with my normal motion i have to tweak the angle i launch at angle referring to between the line my finger makes going left to right and the horizontal the larger the angle the further the ball goes to get this rightbut im currently out of poké balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just had the auto curve happen a couple times for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats great does it stack with the nicegreatexcellent throw bonus now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know who nick sheridan is but im not trusting him any more than i would the other pokemon go clickbait sites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a parody post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seriously op after reading this post how in the hell do you not know that its just a parody
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my favorite part is how fainted pokemon will revive after days nights for the easter event hahaha would actually be hilarious for the record the article is satire
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if all metapods evolved into butterfree i would be really mad actually because then i would have to keep trying to get every single metapod until i catch one just to have one in my pokemon storage and metapods are absurdly hard to get they usually pop out of great ball razzberry at cp it would be torture
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is nothing to trust its a parody post all you have to do is actually read it to know that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea but some people take it too literally
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anyone who takes that post literally after reading it needs serious help
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,adults yes but younger kids would be pretty gullible and believe it just like clickbait youtubers i have had some kids ask me if i ever got a egg so yea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is so much worse then a egg post seriously my year old would know this was fake
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live across from a fire station and have never seen a blastoise in the wild
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a blastoise spawn about meters from a fire house weird it was a while ago though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just encountered a blastoise tonight went and looked at google maps when i read this yep it was right on top of a fire station never seen one in the wild before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised went to disneyland and around the mickey mouse statue it was crawling with ratata and raticate ive only seen gastly three times and theyre all at night i havent tried the cemetery
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are theses fire stations poke stops or gyms i ask because in the uk ingress would never accept any portal submissions of fire or police stations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught my lapras at a firehouse at on a thursday exactly one week later i encountered another at the very same location except this time at second one fled and havent seen once since the only wild blastoise ive encountered was at a bowling alley appropriately named surfside lanes it was low cp and fled after a onerock breakout i like the thought of blastoise appearing at firehouses though pretty suiting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a blastoise spawn in a bobsled at the lake placid luge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we have a fire museum stop in my town it seems to frequently spawn from the water biome when lured magikarps mainly psyducksslowpokes less frequently also there is an event center stop with a large fountain in a manmade pond about x a few blocks over which has quite a few magikarp spawns around it oddly enough theres no water on the map api since it is a newer addition im putting on my tinfoil hat and believing that fire stationfountain in a stops name significantly affects the biome keep in mind that biomes spawn certain things and if squirtles pop out regularly then it is normal luck to have seen two full evolutions in months the easiest one to identify is the canal biome as i can guarantee a magikarp psyduck tentacruel slowpoke kingler dratini very rare seen it once or twice before i knew how to find it will spawn in a specific spot near my house every minutes past one of these is also visible on my tracker at my desk at work not close enough to catch anything though i will note that i have never seen a squirtle from this biome another water biome type seems to spawn poliwag staryu goldeen seadra i think a squirtle can appear in these very rarely but i havent found one i can reliably farm to find out for sure though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a firefighter i have nothing but water type spawn at my house magikarp slowpoke psyduck and dratini occasional squirtle and tentacool ive caught vaporeons tentacruel and slowbro too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me too and me too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i spent an hour and a half in a local cemetery that had two stops and a gym in it not a single spawn no ghosts no pidgeys nothing wasnt a glitch either i restarted the app several times to be sure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea it is a stop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,huh maybe the silph road should add fire station to the list of places that you can report a sighting at then we could see if this is actually a trend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,make sure location settings are on etc ive also found that if a device is completely still for minutes that gps error pops up try moving aroundshaking your device
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i run into that problem on my ipad as well the ipad gps is just really bad compared to the iphone if you go outside with it itll be fine but as soon as youre in a house the gps signal error will pop up after like min
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,where can these be purchased
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me too gonna be so worth tho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you dont happen to be using an iphone or samsung like me casecustomcom has a much larger variety including lgs just please dont forget to resize the art and add a backgroundthe hex values are in a text document in the dropbox folder
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wheres the keychain tho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would also be interested in knowing owo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they got removed because of copyright last night you can customize your own using the sticker designs in the dropbox file
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sad id want a keychain over a case ill prolly do that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just make sure to make the outer rim of the pokeball shows in the mockups and add the background colour because the image wont cover the whole space probably
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,udronpes will fix that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,updated
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe you should change it to read something like please dont report event pokemon until after an event is over as people might incorrectly put spawnsnests for the four starts while this event is ongoing i count pikachu as a starter as he was my first pokemon udronpes is this something that can be done or do you want to change it each event thanks for all the hard work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this please ive seen a few pikachu nests pop up on the atlas recently that clearly are just related to the santachu event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would say that youre right but this video makes it look far worse than it is clearly this guy does not know how to play pokemon correctly he was using a flying type against an electric type when he had a graveler sitting in his party and then used two normal types against a fighting type thats just not playing smart i would think it you were strategic with the pokemon you use it would be a little more balanced per fight but you would still have to fight a lot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually the balance currently lies heavily in favor of the attacker source i am a beta tester in a group dedicated to studying battle mechanics
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is not too difficult if several people need to build it up it should take several people to take it down that was always frustrating in ingress you needed a group of ppl to build strong portals but one single player was able to take it down i am looking forward to pokemon go for having good defendable gyms and a bit more fun not just flipping gyms a few times a day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when gyms are up to that point it means that at least more other people contributed to get it that high to be able to add those pokemon it is meant to be taken down by more that just one person and with there being three teams there will always be teams able to attack the one team that holds it im sure it will vary a lot from place to place but i bet most places it will be hard to even build a gym up to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as im sure its been stated by now taking over a gym is supposed to be a group effort if you wanna take it alone and can then you should expect to do the work of at least people on the built up gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heck no to easy to take out a gym understand to get a gym above the you get for putting pokemon on it you have to train against it with a pokemon that is within cp of both pokemon times to raise it from to prestige to move it to a lvl gym if it only has pokemon on it that means you only get prestige per fight and to build would mean fights to take down the same gym you can have a way over powered pokemon group beat it up and take down that same gym at prestige points for battling pokemon so to take a gym from lvl prestige to with pokemon would only take battles as once it hits under prestige it can only host pokemon to me thats a lot of build up for a quick take down the argument to that is you can bring in your team and build it up yes you could but you can also bring in your team to tear it down but unlike training where you only get one pokemon to try and get through all of them to build up the prestige you get to use different pokemon to tear it down in my opinion its still to easy to destroy a gym as compared to build it up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyms are meant to be battled with a few people and they need to be hard enough to entertain players obviously itll be harder to beat as an individual but this guy wasnt playing very strategically
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah thats true i just hope that with the right pokemon it isnt too hard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,could you elaborate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if by that point you mean defending pokemon then its people not but i do agree that if three people help set up the defense of a gym it shouldnt be taken down easily by one person
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that guy must love the struggle life its not that hard if youre not just spamming the quick attack and you actually successfully dodge enemy attacks i took a level gym down alone with pokemon around that cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will highlight one of the many examples and facets we have discovered i had identical arcanines both at cp identical health identical moves i set one on a gym and attacked him and the attacking arcanine absolutely destroyed the defending one and lost an extremely small amount of hp the main reason being that the attacking arcanine attacks much more often than the defending one due to me tapping the screen the defending arcanine on its own would only do about quick attacks in the time that it took me to land quick attacks later once arcanine was knocked off the gym by another trainer i switched their roles and had the same results also consider this the attacker at the gym gets to choose their pokemon to attack usually ones that have moves that are super effective the defender does not have that luxury
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup i definitely thought they said defending not their own right away so is right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,now its controlled by a level player ive never seen before uh huh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no because powering up never changes ivs if a tyrogue has defense as its highest iv for example there is nothing you can do to it to change it to attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,combat power cp isnt the pokemons attack power though it may sound like it cp is actually a combination of all the stats hit points attack and defence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when they introduce breeding change might be possible i wonder
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks everyone that responded appreciate it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,jolteons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or better jolteon gyarados is a paper defender
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what did you use for scanning that gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bunch of idiots lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i love gyms stacked with gyarados jolteon is the only eevolution i like design wise and its very satisfying to fry all these gyarados with thunderthunder bolt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,get hungry for how savage of a beating im about to throw on that gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it still lasts about min for someone to solo any gym and two man doesnt mater what you put in it in my opinion is good to get all gyms at level even if they look like this it keeps the solo players away because it takes to long to beat more than gym but if you are a team that go at a gym and boom lvl you can try and make it diverse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,golem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,frankly i like em last summer it was all arcanines all the time and at least gyarados is interesting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you know anyone on your team in your area have a facebook page or anything im valor and we have a semiorganzied group with a facebook group and stuff and sometimes well build a gym and say stuff like hey guys just built this gym lets make it a snorlax gym or something i know its not good to have a gym of the same type its really just for fun but the point is you should find your teammates and tell them that gyarados really isnt the best defender
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you probably only need jolteons to take them all out maybe even if they are bhp gyarados
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good question lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i only place zen headbutt snorlaxes to try and counter this but yeah not much you can do if your teammates selfishly go for highest cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try to get a group going to build a lvl gym nearby with actual defenders and show them the value of good defenders then report all the trainers that knockout the lowest cp ones to place in their bad highcp trash
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you find out thats what i was wondering too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hungry ill have a dragonite starter a jolteon main course and lapras for desert please that is minutes of pure gym fun right there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my favorite thing on my first day off is to grab some breakfast with me and sit under a level gym munching as i grind it down its so satisfying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not really its only that long if good defenders are placed a gym full of dragonites rhydons and gyarados goes down very fast the more of them the faster the fall
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and to be clear i would rather have a gym system that favored actual defenders but until we get that this is what were going to be stuck with
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,isnt it spelt zeus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my brothers and i named our eeveelutions like that i have the vaporeon named poseidon my brother has the jolteon named zeus and my brother has the flareon named hades d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope currently i use poketrack android app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,who cares i am in level gyms so have fun d it takes me less resources and time to get in another one and even leave spots open for others d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,father of apollo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,riordans fans
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cool i too love riordan and my raichu is named zeus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it means you caught it today try googling the answer to simple questions like this before posting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if im not mistaken its a visual representation of recently caught pokemon i might not be right on this one but from personnal experience it seems to appear on all pokemon caught in the last if you want to check it yourself sort them by recently obtained and you will see the ones at the top have the blue light
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blue light means most recently caught within the past hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope it just takes us a few minutes to post why a post was removed and you only gave us like minutes d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i know they are being shadowbanned can the moderators please explain if it is because these posts are dominating the subreddit then why not shadow ban both sides
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,intentional curveball super curves now its like throwing in a wind tunnel
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive noticed that pokemon do attack animations and jumps much more frequently curveballs are also really hard to hit because the screen isnt wide enough meaning there is a limit to how far you can throw with curveballs on the upside androids battery saver doesnt freeze anymore d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can no longer click on pokemon in the big tracker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,text is blurry and pixelated sounds like we need a minor text fix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its too early to speak with any certainty but my impression from a few gym battles this afternoon has been that defending pokemon are attacking at different speeds now my metric here is how many water guns i can get in before having to dodge i noticed confusion from an egxecutor left space for while thundershock from jolteon allowed me previously the defending pokemon were pretty reliably striking every as per the code didnt want to make a main post about this but just wondering if anyone else has observed it or if its just me if its worth trying to dig deeper
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the compass function is not new in this update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres now a loading lag time after throwing a razz berry before you see the heart effect
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the distances and angle for pokemon have changed as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anyone else notice the battery drain increase for their phone my battery drain with no other apps open has increased to and with batter saver it brings it to roughly ios lost battery saver and android still has it btw confirmed via my android and brothers iphone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,battery saver is only removed from ios as far as i know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,another fix i have noticed that pokestops have been fixed i have not had the try again later bug yet and it seemed that when the stop turns blue there is no sec wait
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyve fixed the pokédex for players using a res screen this might be the reason for the font changes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive noticed that at times when tossing out pokeballs the ball will hang in the air the pokemon will then do a jump or attack animation and then the capture animation will start android on a galaxy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,three little horizontal lines menu also known as a hamburger menu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,now you cant transfer a favorite pokemon you have to unfavorite it before the transfer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no more curve ball thats good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokevall looks much better on encountersnot in menu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,setting your locating method to wifi and mobile networks now results in the game telling you gps signal not found and never updating your location previously this method worked fine consuming less power than gps but giving a less accurate location they may have disabled this because the location jitter was letting people slowly hatch eggs with their phones unattended
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,havent seen this posted anywhere so i noticed the clouds over the map are now moving slowly from left to right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hate the new bold text for pokémon cp etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,touching the compass switches from facing camera north and character direction probably not new youre right this was a feature before the update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,power up animationui flow is corrected
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is now a combined total xp stat listed on your avatarbadge screen as well as the current xp youve gained towards the next level dont know if thats worth noting but i like it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was just on my options screen and the opt inout of email thing is gone also im not certain as i dont have a lot of pokemon to evolve to do more thorough testing but moves actually seem to be carrying over with evolutions most of the time now the ones i tried most of them carried over at least one move though i still had some where the moves seemed to change randomly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,imo text is larger bolder and smoother now ios overall app seems smoother visually too though i dont have a prepatch screenshot to confirm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,opening the page for grimer no longer causes crashes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,quick scrolling down the pokémon list with fingers doesnt seem to be working for me on android since the update my friend on ios can do it still though can anyone else on android confirm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,android user here game still freezes when using battery saving mode happened more often than usual last night also touching the compass definitely spun it around before this update i used it a lot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my app froze when in battery saver mode last night post update so i just turned it off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have experienced the android battery saver freeze a handful of times today on a nexus im not sure if its been mentioned yet but it appears the viewing angle on most pokemon ive seen so far has changed those that were super close before now appear to be moved back in the encounter screen some pokemon also have entirely different hit boxes for catching them my main example being drowzee before the capture circle was roughly the size of the whole model its now centered on the head and it appears drowzees spawn much further from you this appears to apply to most larger pokemon ive also noticed it with tauros and magmar as for the curveball change if you have a pokemon at max distance from you you really need to let that curveball fly already had to throw multiple high cuveballs over the top of the screens view to catch far away pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we took away the nice great and excellent throw bonuses niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for some reason the app wont log me in when im connected to charles proxy to check ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use a galaxy note and so far my battery saver is not freezing my screen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is the quick throw exploit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what was the quick throw exploit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,battery saver still freezes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the battle resolution screen on gyms does not list the gyms prestige change anymore and instead only shows it decreasingincreasing in an animation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is much harder to swipe between pokemon detail pages now but you can now top in the upper right and left corners to move between them other sources
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,battery saver still makes the game unresponsive for me i have a galaxy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,shop button on the egg incubation screen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i read the curveball exp fix was in this update but i hit excellent with a curve and i only got the anyone else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,transfer pokemon button seems to be gone as well probably a bug but worth noting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the avatar model can now be rotated around just like pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the image is not pixelated its lower resolution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only one person may catch a pokemon now my wife and i were laying in bed with game open an eevee appeared for both of us as soon as she caught it it disappeared off map and tracker for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah was this really necessary i spent a long time getting the muscle memory right to get excellents on curveballs and now its completely different
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seriously i just wasted balls trying to curve it i managed to catch the pokemon with a regular throw and it still gave me the curveball bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought i was drunk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,have you had trouble throwing it for higher levelevolution pokemon that stand further back i cant seem to get it far enough back without it over curving and missing the pokemon completely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at least you dont accidentally curve balls now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,android here battery saver still freezing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on the upside androids battery saver doesnt freeze anymore d too good to be true i kiss having it on lol ill post it up and hopefully its true
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just tried battery saver mode out on android times and the game was responsive after all but one my connection had dropped out for that one so im not sure if it was related i even caught a pokemon that spawned while the phone was upside down living the dream
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah my curve balls often hit the menu buttons and cancel the throw completely very irritating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont know why they didnt just remove the tracker and be done with it slowly disabling it bit by bit is just pointless
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,make minor text fix great again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyve been building up to this to justify a future minor text fix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well they did modify attack stats so maybe they might have changed how gyms work as well guess well have to wait and see
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can confirm ive played around a bit with that previously
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it only worked very spottily and occasionally before this update on ios for me for instance i think i only got it to set up behind me and my movements once additionally it had never been responsive to the direction i was facing but once briefly and it was never this responsive i wasnt sure if it was intended to work or not actually so i think this is a fix for ios at least this is huge and you guys should give more credit when credit is due
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks ill update it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mind explaining
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the info ill update the main thread
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use a mah power bank that when playing before on my galaxy i could keep the screen fullbright play music have pokemon going remote ripple vnc viewer running and tab to chrome whenever i needed while never dropping now my phone is struggling to stay topped i watch the power drop a point or two then take a bit to jump back up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah it drains my battery more too now by a similar amount it used to be that i could go out for and drain of my battery now it only takes about an hour to drain battery lggoogle nexus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still present for android at least for my phone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn that sucks i didnt know it wasnt there anymore and stuck my phone in my pocket it was unusual how warm it was getting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it seemed that when the stop turns blue there is no sec wait i have the same feeling
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive had the same experience as soon as a stop turns blue now itll let me spin again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just noticed that on mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think youre right i dont think i could see the arenas gyms near me without leaving bird view for a smaller angle but now i can
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i think so too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you notice that the roofs of buildings dont flicker anymore too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,which is actually a good change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you mean the random curve balls i havent tried it first and only pokemon i ran into ran away after my first throw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i knew something looked different
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just checked finger scrolling doesnt work for me anymore guess ill just get used to using the slider on the right i dont really have any way to check this but i feel like the scrolling on the pokemon list is smoother for me since the patch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,likewise people should still avoid battery saving mode
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they patched it out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeadvisor seems to no longer be working either at least not for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you threw the pokeball as soon as the pokemon cp xx text appeared you basically couldnt miss and would always get nicegreat throws
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when you first loaded the pokemon catch screen with the ball nonar mode you could time it so as the zoom out animation started you threw the ball at the pokemon while it was still relatively close to the ball thus resulting in a hit rate and often a nice great or excellent throw this also increased the catch rate overall in my opinion now you can no longer quick throw the ball during the zoom out animation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,swipe up on the bottom of the screen right when the encounter loads up and the ball will always catch the pokemon unless it breaks out or it does its attack anim it could cause some glitches though such as void rattata which is thought to be that the ball bounced off rattatas head directly upward and the game forgot to make gravity happen so the pokeball went up and slowly eclipsed the sun or moon until the entire background was black
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you could throw a pokeball while the camera was still moving to its normal location doing so would allow you to throw while the pokemon was closer increasing the chance of hitting it see this httpsgfycatcomadmiredeachdevilfish
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they screwed up the extra xp you get from hitting it in the circle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its actually moved into the little horizontal lines menu on the bottom right with a redundant favourite button
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its just in a different menu easier quicker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you could always do that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,noticed that too it helped me check stuff out when updating my character i remember when first making it it annoyed me that i couldnt rotate edit guys its in the customization screen before when you first customized your character you couldnt rotate it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope was just playing in a person stop location after the updatejack layton ferry terminal everything is normal we catch every thing the same it would be pretty dumb to let one person catch one pokemon with people the eevee must have expired
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hm we need to verify this this will really suck if its true
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this would be virtually gamebreaking if true i hope to god this is just a coincidence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,she may have caught it right at the end of its spawn window i was sitting outside a game shop with another player and we both had an eevee pop up both were able to catch it no problems at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,getting excellents is no longer necessary because im pretty sure it doesnt give an xp bonus anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that muscle memory still transfers you just gotta hook it real hard sideways and it swoops right back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i never use curves balls but sometimes i get the bonus for it anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was drunk wasted way too many pokeballs p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,zubats are reaaaaaally difficult right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its sooo difficult they mustve changed this with the update i ran into a strong rapidash today and i couldnt even hit him
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here on android happens sliiightly less often but it still freezes regularly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what phone are you using ive had my battery saver working for about hours without it messing up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the touch screen seems to stop working when the red rectangle showing no internet connectivity appears but as soon as it reestablishes connection touch screen returns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here are some pokemon which could be right next to you or away have fun knowing you have minutes and a chance of actually finding that snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,listing nearby is definitely better than nothing especially if you still have knowledge of the spawn points near your personal most common locations home work school etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess the update gonna be yuuuuuggge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well onix used to be big as a house where now he is further back venonat used to be very close but is further now and ponyta is practically a speck on the horizon and his hit box is smaller growlithe and geodude also seem to be a bit further away these are the common ones in my area and i pretty much had a muscle memory built into hitting greats or nice throws on the first shot and now im underthrowing pretty regularly just need to get used to it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my phone is the lg btw not sure but maybe stats will help regarding phone drain if theres the phone thats having the issue too and no problem on the battery saver mode info
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i believe it was just on ios devices i have an iphone and my husband has an android he has the option and i dont anymore not that i ever used it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and the transfer button is no longer at the bottom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep random curve balls probably wasted ultra balls from unintentional curve balls but now intentional curve balls are really funny you can spin it and throw it horizontally and it hits the pokemon coming from side of screen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no go back to rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,took me a minute to sort it out too haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whew knowing the iv of your pokemon was destroying the game im glad they spent the time on stopping that rather than making finding pokemon fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems to be working for me newer pokemon i caught today are appearing correctly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nopeu could not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ya me too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe its just a new bug in this version after it disappeared i reloaded my game and the eevee didnt reappear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it makes it more likely you catch the pokemon of course theyre necessary
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you just gotta then its not in his muscle memory
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lg with android still freezes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get that were mad about it but its still a fairly limited range
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,unless you keep track of where and when pokemon spawn found a dragonair because of that it ran away but at least i found it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my experience pokemon dont just center they can be closer farther away and sometimes might be a glitch appear off center
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im pretty sure distance changes at times i remember having a growlithe close and very far away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whenever a mon escaped the ball it would always jump further back maybe thats what it is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah it takes me at least throws to catch a doduo now its really hard to throw a curveball when the pokemon is so far back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol suck it apple fanboys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice to hear this gonna go test it out today
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,using a proxy wasnt the only way to look up the iv of your pokemon it was just one of many tools
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,uh yeah you could can confirm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,likely that your wife caught the eevee just before it despawned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does it though i dont remember hearing if this was proven or not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does it though i dont remember hearing if this was proven or not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my bad actually thought it was at the furthest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anecdotally but ive always noticed when a pokemon breaks out it moves backwards at least sometimes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i found theyre further back than ive seen them before like this rapidash i saw earlier even getting the pokeball to travel that far was tough let alone getting it in the circle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no i know they move further back after they break out im talking about first encounter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes because it was so useful that i should cry forever about not having it now because of my choice in phones grow up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre not even remotely on topic with my comment troll somewhere else that cares about your antiniantic circlejerk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id appreciate it if you can point me to a tool that is accurate and doesnt involve using candies and dust not sarcasm im really looking for an option that works now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in the customization screen when you first are customizing your character
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think i remember it being proven through data mining but i could be wrong
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,always noticed when a pokemon breaks out it moves backwards at least sometimes of the time it breaks out every time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if thats your first throw thats exactly what im talking about i know they back up after you miss but ponyta and rapidash especially are much further away now when you first encounter them than they were you always had to peg them in the face but its a small target being so far away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think he probably meant it as a playful jab pull the stick out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpspokeadvisorcom you have to sign in with your account though only drawback
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in the customization screen not the trainer card back when you were stuck with your only customization you werent able to rotate it when customizing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that would require me to have actually been upset by the comment to begin with dude
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your response seemed like you were sorry if i misinterpreted it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hope i hatch one saving for lucky egg spree larvitars are rare where i am from
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got one yesterdayafter around eggs soooo happyyyyyy got candies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely luck i hatched larvitars the first one giving me candies and the second giving me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive hatched dratini from the lake and my apartment stop has given out pineco i kept getting the same egg hatches at home so i made a point to go out today and gather different eggs got a wider variety of hatches its only week one though so this all couldve been luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got candies with my larvitar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had the same
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,candies here but my guy was iv
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats why i posted thisbetween friends and myself there have been a cumulative larvitar sightings im the only one who has even hatched them so it would be awesome if theres a constant candy given cuz then it would only require hatchlings to get tyranitar for the dex i didnt know if anyone had had different luck with candies and wanted to find out good luck with your hatching spree
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wanna be at that lake i could use a good army of dragonite i have a pretty random collection of eggs and everything has hatched into something different so there could be a pattern there if not one with candy drops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rng did you dirty at least you got a good hatch though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dang im jealous this one was like a and the other was an im hoping for something that good to evolve and then praying for moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and it wasnt even great ivs for a hatch but at level would be over cp so not too bad i will start walking it and hopefully catch or hatch a better one by the time i get to candies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes you need to live work in building in the high floors do not use high accuracy for location switch every hr between wifi and phone data plan will encourage drift hope this helps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a pringle can no joke
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my old office used to get massive amounts in the elevator going up and down floors switching between wifi and mobile data or find an area with not so great reception that always worked well for me although i have never tried to make my character drift those are just ways that it happened in the past
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,has anybody tried using something like a metal toolbox
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you live in a level house youre not going to get gps drift if you have a basement you might be able to get some drift basically the more things between you and the sky the worse your gps signal and therefore the greater your gps drift
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the disadvantage is temporary eventually you will get high enough level attackers and decent cp defenders so you can compete in the gym game the way you wish dont make yourself crazy trying to figure out how to beat cheaters edit i am not implying using gps drift is cheating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why do you play i play for personal achievements wouldnt be proud of gaining some advantage of gps drift
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,elaborate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this works for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not necessarily im on the fourth level of a condo building but i receive insane gps drift an hour just by opening and closing the control center of my iphone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because the tracker for actually walking is bs to say the least if you walk miles and the game tries to say you only walked which happens to people all the time then theres a problem once its fixed by all means try to act like youre better than everyone else but until then gtfo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the can is thick and has aluminum coating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is why i said house condos are have a concrete or steel structure which definitely throws off gps signals more than any house wood frame house to be more specific
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly i rode my bike today all under the speed lock and i got
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,let me summarize the next dozen posts twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a bunch of that dont have the moveset i want i have arcanines
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyarados with twister d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blastoise with bite and ice beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know gengar is in a bad spot anyways but this just irks me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyrados with twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at least you got shadow claw mine had sucker punch dark pulse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then why do you care doesnt it makes you feel better knowing that it would suck no matter what it got p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,double ouch i feel your pain gengar is one of my favorites so i think thats the only reason why having a not fully perfect version of one was frustrating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it does i justwanted it to absolutely perfect in case they rebalance the game unlikely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah it has problems winning against anything its a fairly high level too when i caught it i just put it on gyms that i dont think are going to stay up to show it off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do the same thing with my raichu and omastar omastar is decent i just dont have the candy to power it up much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice moveset and cool pokestop though im guessing youre not hurting for eeveelutions with that amount of candies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats i have a metric fckton of eevee candies but catching a wild vaporeon is still exciting i caught my third ever wild one during the event whats the ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live on an eevee nest that has never migrated since day so yeah i have a lot of evolved fighters this ones not so high but my first wild capture so i was pretty excited
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hes pretty low level atk def sta no need to level him up but ill still keep him to commemorate the water festival
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im playing on an so it definitely still works my wife had the exact same problem trying to play on ios though she had to upgrade her ios version to to get it working again she has an iphone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had same problem had to uninstall and reinstall it goes back to crashing if i change accounts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they did a force update yesterday for ios i believe you stated that she did not do the update is it possible that it is the app itself closing and not the os i do know that it runs terrible on my friends though she hasnt played it in months due to the stress it puts on the phone either way i wish you and your mom good luck with this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are you on ios ill try updating and hope that works and doesnt run slow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hm tried installing and reinstalling again twice still no luck im going ti try updating to ios and hope it doesnt run slow any experience with ios on an iphone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup im on ios pogo runs fine if i turn off sound effects and music i should also mention that while updating her ios version my wife did also clear out some space on her phone so that might have also been a factor but you said you already tried that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on iphone and i think it was or something screwed up my phone for a bit on the latest ios now and phone seems to be handling it alright im wary of future updates now pretty soon they are going to phase out the
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i must say im really impressed with the simplicity and crispness of design by utarzazk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,shoutout to uiamjunglefresh for their design httpsimgurcomafkcqe which did not make the top by just a couple votes your design was loved by many including myself but narrowly missed victory i just wanted to say great job
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really liking option although is a very very close second
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,has the best combination of functionality and looks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyre all nice but i prefer number two its crisp and minimalist
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awesome cant wait to order some
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like the minimalist of the rank section of and the team customization of i think overall is my fav and i think all should have a section for the region subreddits too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,number its beautiful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,two but without the subreddit url
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sure its something that the moderators have thought of already but just in case there are currently a couple of regional subreddits which have grey coloured flairs uk ireland and usa mountain west so something might need to be done to help with visibility good luck to all designs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when weve chosen our favorite design how will we be able to use it udreamerbee utarzazk uquiteus will we receive the template to change it to our name etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sure any of the three designs will likely undergo some fine tuning i had meant to revise my submission at some point using the suggestions that have been offered i just havent had the opportunity i would imagine most cards could be flattened down and left with only relevant fields for editing custom flair and text
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i must say they all look great but between them i find myself quite partial to design not only does it have the region icon easily identifiable at a glance like all the rest but it sets itself apart from the others by also incorporating team color into the design considering how crucial that info will become ingame sure its currently lacking a flip side though to be fair not all business cards have a flip side but i really like how elegantly the information is worked into the design my only real gripe is the font which i feel can use a bit more work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,liked a lot but the rank line is an issue since id imagine that will change so id have to make more cards is more sensible due to that and i like the emblem placement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so about the region symbols are they final or will they be when the game is released what if a region splits will all the people in the region be sent new cards with new symbols
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like the design of and the font of d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is an edited comment i like the front from number and the back from number where it says not all those that wonder are lost i think it would be cool to combine the cards anyways team work baby but well see what is the plan with the final design are we going to order them based on what team we pick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im very pleased with either of the first two
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id like see with region flair
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my vote is for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one of my criteria for voting in the last round was whether or not the card had a qr code i definitely voted for one that didnt have one but i think theyre important to have if youre trying to show off the silph road to a friend or an acquaintance i think it would be really cool to be able to just pull it up right then and there especially when there are already so many individual subcommunities for each region as of right now the only design that has a qr code is and one thing i hadnt considered was that still doesnt have a back that means potentially only is left out unless perhaps the yellow and white bars on the back of extend to wrap around a code but it might be too late to change that all in all i really like all of these designs and bravo to each of their creators i just think that the qr code adds an extra layer of functionality that really shouldnt be ignored id love to see one on all of the designs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe looks the most professional and wins for the informative link to silph road qr code and all very good design
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree but what exactly does the dolphin represent did i miss something
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,indeed thats my pick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the shoutout really appreciate it while im sad to see it missing out im proud of my design may it wander the internet for all eternity
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i loved this one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sacramento hey im vacaville
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wanted this one it feels classy good job ✌
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think after the winner is announced the winner could look at the second best and check if he can adapt his to the second place a bit if the voting is close
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a couple people in charge have hinted at possibly putting the card in the silph shop i would assume if that happened then yeah it would be a template that could change your name team region etc likely we would end up working with those who created the design in order to do so
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since i plan on changing the colour scheme for each subregion i think the easiest way would be to make the psds available through a drive folder like the sr resources themselves theyd need to be edited on photoshop but i guess if one were to go to a print shop to get them made theyll probably have the program there ive used the fonts the sr made available in their resources folder
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is not even my final form quiteus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am not he who would be deciding that i am merely one of you organizing this by permission of couple higherups if you really are curious about that i would ask udronpes as he is the man with answers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its actually front and backs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats actually japans region flair the flair and colour scheme would change depending on the region id made a few other examples for my first prefeedback version of the design httpimgurcomapoplw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,again not all designs are final and qr codes are an easy thing to throw in i feel like one of them said they might add one once the silph road app is released dont lose hope
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im pretty sure its the regions sign dolphin is pacific coast so im assuming anywhere else would have their regions sign on the card
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that was just an example of what the card would look like for a player on pacific coast the dolphin is the symbol for that region
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn man yours has all the style of the first two but actually bothered to have a space for reddit usernames which is the only thing i liked out of the third good job man wish we could do writeins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was sad to see it missing from the poll
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep looked like winner
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ayyyy youre actually the closest person ive found to me so far havent found anybody else from around here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we have a few of regions working on changing their flair the us south flair has been finalized waiting on it to be updated a lot going on with tsr with all of that happening before finalizing any design per region check with wardens to make sure there arent any changes inbound
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry i had no idea just thought it was deco lol oops and hey they all look awesome voted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the feedback maybe we could start a petition for it haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a couple bay area folks i found as well i think i need to get onto my laptop to add my city flair i usually go out to sacramento on sundays to play ingress while my wife goes to goth night at a club itll be changing to pokemon here soon d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no problem there are a lot of flairs to keep track of and i know jps may not be as easily identifiable as others being a pokeball and all thanks for the vote im happy you like them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey im from sacramento lets definitely keep in touch when this comes out maybe we can make a squad to dominate the area i livework in the ardencarmichael area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i didnt see this until now but thats awesome i live pretty close to there i live in the orangevalecitrus heights area will definitely have to keep in touch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,arden arcade checking in what up fellow cowtowners
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ahh more i am happy to hear from nearby people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,better yet rpokemongoivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gym and pokestop selection seems random regardless of density or population what is the name of your town i could ask someone to look into it and see how many gymsstops there are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my guess would be that the stops and gyms are determined by an algorithm or process that strips out portals within a set distance from other portals and assigns gyms to a certain percentage of those trying not to have too dense a population of gyms in an area in a more rural area everything is spread out more so you would probably have at least one gym just maybe less stops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since there are some stopsgyms where apparently ingress doesnt have portals i wouldnt worry too much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if of portals are gyms then you would have in your town so even then you should be fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cutting of portals out is actually really smart on niantics part if the gyms start to fill up with unbeatable pokémon they could always add more gyms from the of unused portals would keep gyms more accessible for new players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its ok ill find out soon enough i didnt know it was randomized though so maybe that could be good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe somebody can check out my little town of pana illinois i dont think there are any beta testers near me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that algorithm is hit and miss ive got two gym withing spitting distance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ohhh ok thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i think not sure about the numbers tbh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and whats stopping the ace trainers from putting other unbeatable pokemon into the new gyms especially since they would have had gathered a lot of coins and dust to power up their new mons even more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure thing best of luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are gyms within several hundred meters of the main intersection of town the memorial library masonic temple and museum are all gyms there are about or stops within a meter range as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah it definitely bunches them up sometimes im sure there is something to do with random computer generated numbers not being truly random or something
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,laziness tons of ingress portals go unclaimed simply because no one wants to make an effort to go get them great pokes will take so much stardust that eventually even the aces are only going to have a few unbeatable ones
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fair enough i dont really know how hard its to take mons into uber status so maybe it will just take way too much effort to have many laying around
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyve restocked once previously so there isnt a pattern we can determine at least you know they will eventually restock as theyve made the effort to say temporarily out of stock
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thankee i really wanted to buy a bag expansion during the water event but cant really complain too loudly about free stuff
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyve restocked on amazon if youre looking to redeem something might go fast
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,restocked google today got bag upgrades and lots of incubators yay
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,swinub rates have gone way down so something has changed for sure whether this also affects rareevolved pokemon i have no idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,encountered a wild charizard today hitmontop yesterday and i notice a ton of fire pokemon while this place has been a water biome since they implement it rng luck or a shift idk but im not complaining
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its rng people report this every single day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,caught my grimer in the wild today previously id hatched with i pinap i was able to reach probably rng but im grateful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the local scanners are picking up dragonites where previously none had spawned before in the past as well as larvitar evolution line all over town i also found a meganium outside my apartment once the event ended
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and here i sit with just the crap mons back again not even karps spawn where they used to spawn before the event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol i havent even seen a wild charmander besides my first catch😂 ive walked my charmander to candies so far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know its mainly rng but they did also just do a nexmst migration so its not impossible that things changed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,silly question here whats rng
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats sweet im certainly not dissapointed about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i managed to get one with the starter event stuck with squirtle here usually pretty awesome surprise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah its quite impossible and they didnt just do a nest migration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,depends on your region for me in canada we had one about a week ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fyi thats not recently as they migrate every two weeks the next is a just under a week away it also doesnt depend on your region although sometimes a nest might migrate to the same thing it already was or a common so it appears to no longer be a nest for two weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh my bad thanks for the heads up sorry about the misinformation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont have a picture but from the top of my head they have waterfront city grasslandfarmland mountain not sure if thats all of them or not though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,click on the word biomes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice try niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe cemetery was one i could be wrong
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cant remember if cemetery and hospital were official biomes or if it was just a fan thing that got out of hand
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i noticed it too i threw about balls at a wild arcanine all went straight until he ran jerkface
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i support this even with extensive bag use throws have been straight for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had it on golbat a couple of minutes ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,finally
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldnt really like this catching great pokemon should be a challenge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really i mean i agree that catching rare pokemon shouldnt be easy but having a mechanic that punishes the player even when the player made the correct move is ridiculous there are much better ways to make capturing pokemon challenging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it was all over this subreddit when the second wave came out from memory they were only a week or two apart this however is no indication that you should use to judge when wave two for us will come for aunz we are still only on the first wave and its been a month now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would also make sense that they wouldnt release another wave without collecting substantial amounts of data from testers in the initial one which takes a significant amount of time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i remember hearing about the second wave and now that you mention it i suppose it was maybe a couple of weeks after the initial one its all speculation and conjecture but for some reason this puts my mind at rest lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they had the autocurveball happen to them but i havent personally experienced it since the update with about berries used across pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,accidental curve doesnt seem to be accidental in my case it is something that happens when facing high cp pokemon in my case curving the ball intentionally counters it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this problem has been going on for months unfortunately there isnt a solution or fix if you switch to the mon the one who was fainted but not really will be back to normal for the next fight thats the only tip i can give when i prestige i have to include or generalist prestigers in expectation of this bug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,please tell me there is some way to avoid this it drives me insane the only winning move is not to play seriously i havent bothered with gyms for months because every time i do i want to uninstall the game and never touch it again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have strategies i use depending on the gym in question only prestige with high cp tanky mons a cp snorlax with hyper beam will faint almost any cp mon but a snorlax cp lapras or similar will just power through it its actually surprisingly efficient as well as youre often able to knock out more than one defender with your attackers even if you get nowhere near experience per battle only fight gyms that require or less cp to prestige ive almost given up on high level gyms unless someone just have been shaved its simply too cumbersome dont dodge yep sometimes its actually more efficient to just eat that charge move and move on to your next mon than to try to snap out of that that tends to happen keep a copy of an older version of the apk and install just before battle you can grab it from most places online apkmirrorcom seems to be the most popular one also keep a newer version and simply upgrade once youve finished battling
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the faintloop has always been around but this latest build is definitely the worst in terms of gym lag im quite familiar with lag but i never had to deal with dodged followed by my whole health bar being sapped what seems like a whole half second later the manual swap has always been the only way to deal with the faintloop like others suggested you can using tankier mon which are lag resistant youll take the charge attack damage for about one second but it will revert back since your mon has too much reserve health to actually die from it the other possibility is to adjust your strategy and use fodder as much as possible itll lessen the blow and save you resources but at the expense of much efficiency
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does anyones phone also get crazy hot during gym battles ive nearly burned myself when i dont have a case on my phone gotten into the habit of wrapping my phone in ice packs if im planning on hitting the gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is beyond frustrating at the moment so much lag makes me need to use six pokemon to kill like only two defenders ridiculous
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sadly this is well known bug which came back with latest update we need to wait for new app version which will hopefully solve this problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is anyone getting network errors when battlingtraining it happened two different occasions today for me its beyond frustrating because ill be battling a growlithe and then the network will crap out i cant quit because the network wont read so ill just stand there for the full seconds i know its not my carrier when i get kicked out from the gym ill catch whatevers nearby and spin stops no problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try using apk version if you have android still works for me and you wont have that many bugs as the latest versions gym battling works better
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im glad you posted this as each time i battle i attempt to learn to dodge better when i read of people being great at dodging i always wonder what is wrong with me i watch the videos i practice on quiet gyms i know what the flash is and watch for it but no matter what i do i rarely get into the rhythm to dodge most attacks and i am level i dont let it bother me however at this time as we all know the gyms are being revamped soon i love playing so much i just take the bugserrorsetc in stride and remember to be happy that this wonderful game and this amazing forum exists
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they are overhauling the gym system so they dont bother fixing it anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you could use throwaway mons and just let them take the hits otherwise use tanky pokemon that wont die due to the dodge bug the absolute worst is when your last pokemon are affected by the dodge bug and the game keeps swapping them in and out until they are both dead i have found though that if you just keep tapping the button you can still do some damage hope that helps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in all seriousness try dodging earlier i have all the same problems i fully agree with you but i took down a lvl all snorlax hyperbeam today had the same issues with this gym it is laggy where it is and hyperbeams would instakill because of the bug i had an actually successful dodge today that i though i started too early but instead it worked so i tried to adjust my dodges to start about a half second earlier than i used to in about of cases it fixed the issue ps this obviously means anticipation of the charge move becomes more difficult and you cant rely on the regular charge move ques
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i find it more confusing than frustrating actually i think my mon is dead and then suddenly an invisible mon comes to fight and i have completely lost my train of thought as far as who is going to battle whom in the gym its frustrating but im not going to quit playing because of it i just figure everybody else has the same disadvantage so in that case when everybody has the same thing it evens out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it sucks even more when its your last mon alive and youre like two hits from beating last mon in gym dead lost the battle and lost prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,play rough and submission did that too regardless of health ive also noticed theres a bug that will either steal a blip from my charge and make me hold down like an idiot or fully charge the bar right after i launch the charged attack and give me two hydro pumps in a row o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use mons who has high hp eventhough its unefficient they can take the full hit and dodge acts regain hp so survives the loop happens only if the mon got fainted with the initial hit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeh dodging has been total rng cos of the lag i mean half the charge moves come up instantly and with no message
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no avoiding it but save decent mon you would transfer anyways and use them instead dont dodge and transfer them when youre done put an exclamation point before their name to make them easy to find
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my psychic blissey tries her best to crash opposition phones to defend her gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are we sure that this is really even a bug anymore its been around forever and the frequency of it just goes up or down depending on new version updates at this point i have to wonder if niantic wants this to be in the game and its now a design feature not a bug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sadly this problem has gotten so much worse in both updates and that i downgraded to where it is far less prevalent gyms are horribly unplayable in the versions its unbelievable how long this has been an issue for niantic really needs to fix it asap currently it ranks personally for me at least as the biggest issuebug in the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes this has become ridiculous since the update previously you could just about get away with it but now with the additional lag its making gyms tough whether prestige or battling im wasting far more revivespotions than necessary right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as everybody here says its known but what i dont understand is if the pokemon you are fighting against is fainting there is obviously a doublecheck before it finally faints why just why dont they put this doublecheck in if one of your own pokemon faints this solution seems to be so easy for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,totally agree ive stopped fighting gyms al together because of this glitch i know they are reworking the gym system but ffs patch this issue so we can at least use the system ee have now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is nothing you can do i was in a training fight and i would see the animation get the damage and then seconds later it would announce the charge move it is completely out of whack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,totally agree its awful but i also can never make it through more that or mon before gps drift causes an error and soft ban ive set up to take down some lev gyms and havent even gotten it down levels in forever due to drift
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just wait until they fix the gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its pretty annoying against blisseys ill dodge it kills me and switches to the next mon but then goes back and forth between my new mon and my old mon that should have survived except hes not there it wastes a good seconds sometimes deciding what mon to let me attack with constantly switching between both the undead and next mon end result is a time out against blissey wtf even cooler is when he kills you with a special your new mon pops up and he hits you with the special again right off the bat sigh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it happens less if i dont keep tapping on attacking i guess many advanced taps being registered and carried out delayed the dodging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it happens less if i dont keep tapping on attacking i guess many advanced taps being registered and carried out delayed the dodging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it happens less if i dont keep tapping on attacking i guess many advanced taps being registered and carried out delayed the dodging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what phone do you have who is your carrier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mildly glad to hear that it isnt just my slightly older phone or something still sucks though thanks for the help
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it actually got worse with the update it used to have this issue only when you dodged during the tail end of the dodge window now we have this issue when you dodge during the beginning of the dodge window theres also a new issue when you dodge during the middle of the dodge window you dodge only partial damage is applied then full damage is applied then the game autocorrects to apply only partial damage so whereas before there would only be area of the dodge window that would trigger this issue now there are at least i wrote several posts on this earlier trying to let people know but for some reason tsr kept deleting them and wouldnt post them shrug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,except when you do that ever since latest update the game determines your fainted but not really pokemon is actually fainted and decides to keep it that way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sad but true between gps issues paired with tiny interaction radius crashing crappy performance poor team assembling network errors and borked dodging im often just finding myself saying out loud and frustrated that i really want to play and enjoy you why wont you let me i cant comprehend the downhill thats going on gyms used to be pretty smooth and somewhat enjoyable before heres hoping that the upcoming gym revamp will turn things around and improve performance once more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah ive taken a break from gyms for the last week partially to rebuild my potion stock but also because it makes me want to stop playing sometimes i think the only thing thats kept me in the game through some of these more obnoxious bugs and the general lag has been the fact that i dropped way too much money on the game in the first few months and now i feel like itd be a waste if i stopped playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,truth i gave up on gyms a while ago but after the event decided to try again it sucks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think that was what the op was asking for does it feel better to drag others with you when you quit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or the bug for short
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just an idea for your first point wigglytuff just bring one along dont fight with it if you know a hyperbeam is coming and you know you wont be able to dodge check my post about starting the dodge earlier throw wiggly in there to dodge with it has fairly low cphp so it shouldnt hurt prestiging efficiency too much wiggly has a ton of hp it shouldnt faint this problem needs real fixing by niantic and it is a pain to deal with but there are ways
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your dont dodge strategy is pretty much the norm when it comes to prestiging for me i think its far less stressful to just have a few extra revives on hand in fact mathematically its much of a muchness anyway if you manage to switch your mon out when theyre low on health they will generally require x potions or x potion if you just feint them their full revival generally requires x revive x potion yes it requires more revives but you could end up saving on potions a bit whatever the case the reduction in gymbattlestress is worth it and i find the nododge strategy fine until like mentions elsewhere in this thread niantic replace the gym system which i feel confident theyre doing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have another option i use from time to time i always keep an expendable high hp or just trash pokemon in the lineup whenever a long charge move is coming solar beam hyper beam earthquake obviously doesnt work for hydropumpstone edge i switch to the sacrificial pokemon kills it dead then back to normal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,use your charge moves as quickly as possible once you end up in a death cycle any saved moves are wasted getting greedy with a single bar prestiger could mean death without getting to use
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why do you upgrade again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed its definitely got much worse with the latest game update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hahaha i can just picture that already looks weird if i stand there for min taking a gym down mashing my phone had a women walk up to me and ask if my phone was frozen lol if im there with an ice pack on my phone someone will call somebody mine gets warm but its winter now so i use that as a hand warmer my hands are the ice pack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it never went anywhere it just happens more often because the latest update is super laggy again the previous being just somewhat laggy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes that happens sometimes to some gyms this is likely a server issue you either suffer through it or take a break and comeback the problem usually goes away with time also try spinning as stop and coming back or loading your journal and going back to battle sometimes refreshing server connection helps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get the invisible revived mon all the time have to switch out to a third mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,galaxy verizon doesnt seem to be a service issue though as even gyms where i get or bars of service will do this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no it is a bug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i suspect theres a bunch of stuff going on underneath to detectprevent bots from hitting gyms that likely is only partially effective if at all that would explain why performance is slowly getting worse when they initially released the code was simpler and they eventually got swamped with bots constantly hitting everything gyms scanning for ivsmovesets etc to fight back they had to add code to try to detect and prevent automated access to their apis eg bots so communications with go servers started to bog down as the servers did more detection work and the clients had to do more authentication work you see the lag to a lesser extent when youre moving around and waiting for pokemon to pop up on screen theres a considerable delay now between when you arrive at a location and get out of the car and when pokemon pop up on your phone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure what it means but borked is going to be my word of the weekend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and who said the sunk cost fallacy was a bad thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this should be the slogan for the game lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this problem needs real fixing by niantic and it is a pain to deal with i think we players maybe need to start pressing this point a bit more i love this game but there are thousands of games that function almost exactly as intended
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,revives are more rare than potions and it is usually potions or a super and potions to heal a prestiger which is much cheaper than a revive and a great using a hyper potion on a prestiger either is a serious waste or you are not prestiging correctly unless of course it is a wiggly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i currently have storage for items and not a single revive for about weeks since gen arrived revives drop for me only from about in spins and then its only one so this bug combined with there being no way for me to successfully restore a stack of revives means im more and more shut out of gym battling why are red basic balls the only item we can buy from the store
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,works if switching occurs with any predictability it used to just lag here but no it could be seconds switching and who knows how much damage will be accessed in that scenario i end up spam dodging no bueno
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sometimes you can its a real mess last night i had three mon with the faint bug that would swap each other out faint and repeat between that and spoofers pgo is in serious trouble everyones so mad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,had a women walk up to me and ask if my phone was frozen dude please tell me you got her number she was hitting on you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i didnt experience dead loops on previous version thats why seamed to me like it vanished for some time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not a phone or provider issue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah k i was gonna say service can be an issue but that doesnt excuse the bugs youre describing ive become pretty numb to them nowadays lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i doubt thats the case the issues mainly seem to be caused by the game client lagging which doesnt affect bots because they dont use it and even if it is there are currently bots that are able to tear down gyms and use ghastly to rebuild them up to prestige in less than minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really im pretty sure revives have a higher droprate than hypermax potions combined i often find myself needing to throw out revives when im restocking potions which takes hours literally
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it rarely got me but it was still there since the last update though it happens all the time everything is so laggy attacking selecting reviving and healing the whole gym process is tedious right now but so is catching pokemon and the go so other than the dailies im taking a break
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes it got much better prior to this update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i can confirm with galaxy edge on proximus network made a similar topic few days ago with it seems to have gotten worse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in the past versions this bug was not disappeared but happened very few times so it was not a problem with the update before to restart to increase but was still manageable now it is the worst situation from july last year
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if your plus is still paired to your phone you can use the phone to track down your plus in much the same way you would track down a mon in the wild a third party app could give you the signal strength which you would use like a properly working steps indicator the bluetooth settings should show you all paired devices
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres an android app called signal sniffer which helped me find my girlfriends lost fitbit will work for any bluetooth device
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a lost item finder called tile that will find anything anywhere in the world as long as its attached hindsight i know but i think ill get one and attach it to mine you can then track it on your phone sorry you lost it hope you find it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just wanted to comment in case people were still finding this thread in searches i lost my go plus and used the bluetooth smart scanner app to scan for it with no luck when my replacement arrived i tested it and unfortunately the scanner only finds it when i actually press the button on the plus the scanner specifically displays it as pokemon go plus so if youre just getting numbers its probably a different device
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you yes it is still paired i will look for a third party app that works i have an iphone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perfect thanks i cant find that app on the ios app store and the only ones i can see cost money ill have to keep digging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah shoot thanks for the response i ended up buying a replacement as well im pretty sure my old one is long gone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bluetooth low energy can theoretically run for years on a button cell if you dont try to run anything else like lights and buzzers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,meh lost mine for a few weeks was in a pants pocket i forgot i had worn
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont have a plus but i grabbed this free from the app store and successfully tracked down my brothers watch and a tv which i hadnt known even had bluetooth that was just the first one i tried its very basic and a bit quirky edit removed broken link
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you find anything free that works definitely update us
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what has this got to do with te idiot asking about a lost device weeks too late no one here can help him yet im down voted for being the only person in here that has sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,see and you solved your issue logically you didnt create a thread about it see where i am going and how low tolerance i have for stupidity good job man
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i gave the link a try says its unavailable in both the canadian and the us store edit searched manually and found it its just showing a bunch of number strings though there are separate devices appearing im not sure what all these number strings mean do you have any tips for interpreting them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would help if someone else with a plus tried this so we would know if the plus is even trackable the only number you need is the dbm the long hex string is the device id when you find you plus you will then know what its device id is which will be helpfull for next time until then youll just have to catch them all the time stamp after the dbm appears to record the last time you saw a particular device click on one entry and the scan will focus on that entry the dbm number is the signal strength its a negative number and gets less negative as you get closer and more negative as you get further away select an entry and move slowly around your house identify the room where the dbm is least negative then walk around that room looking for the hot spot when you think you found the object you are tracking confirm it by moving that object to another location
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok i live in a basement suite so it could be a goose chase the bluetooth devices could belong to who lives above and i have a bunch of other electronics in my closet haha its worth a shot though ill let you know in a day or two if it works out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one other note dont leave the scanner running i believe this is using an active ping so will have a detrimental effect on the battery life of the nearby bluetooth devices
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this has been the strategy since the game came out and common knowledge i feel
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i go blue incubator for and orange incubator for everything else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,very common advice but also very good advice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for people are giving a hard time but i always saw it as a use is a use is a use but this makes the strategy have some more weight for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish i was more efficient at egg hatching sitting with a full gen dex nearly on my jogger and on collector medals respectively tells ive focuses way more on catching than hatching good advice from op
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,many people seem to forget about it but it really is a good idea i also stray away from using incubators now and want to collect as many as possible before using them not to mention that now we have a bigger chance to get a kid from the egg for now im good with using only the orange one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hopefully so when it dawned on me i told a few friends that didnt buy incubators except with gym earned coins and they hadnt thought or heard of it maybe its just that i run with a herd of morons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats it youve got the idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this made my day when i first explained to my cousin a long time ago he saw it the same way as you did and it took me and others a couple times to explain it in different ways for it to make sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure im following any advantages here outside of personal preference i would recommend using incubators and getting those eggs in the oven edit nvm i think i see youre saying your holding the until you get more single use incubators but if you have a goal of getting kid eggs it would be good to bake as many eggs as you can during the event in this time theyre more frequently distributed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre too nice for reddit i feel bad for my previous comment i love you have a good new year
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but if you have a goal of getting kid eggs thats exactly why im saving the incubators i dont want to have kid eggs even though i have jynx candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh youre good its apparent your previous comment is accurate hope some find the info useful even if only a few a good new year to you too and much love
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nowhere does it actually show a time difference but for some reason my phone not my fathers gets the daily bonuses up to an hour earlier recently its not always the same time though sometimes just minutes early last night was minutes early though possibly a similar issue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont understand
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,guys leave the salt in rpokemongo this was mildly humerous and yall are being mean
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think hes got a battery pack strapped to the phone that might be convenient but the heat transfer could be disastrous
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hint charging icon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wasnt meant to be serious
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still dont get it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me neither
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hes gonna ruin his phone with the amount of heat the battery pack and phone create naturally amplified by them being pressed together gonna beat niantic to ruining his wallet i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how are yall gonna manage keeping phone plugged in with cables to power banks kept in the other pocket
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,other pocket or a lot of people plan to take backpacks with them for extended adventures so theyre not forced to buy lunch and drinks everytime theyre thirsty the powerbank could easily go into the backpack they make backpacks with cable holes in the smaller pockets specifically for things like this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure man might be a better idea i did not play ingress and am not experienced in carrying a power bank etc no such case exists for my phone though you guys arguments seem valid i can use a longer cable and keep the battery in my pocket did not mean that photo to be very serious more kind of a jokefooling around with idea i dont mind the downvotes dont really understand it though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure man most backpacks have holes designed for headphone cables nowadays could easily use them for this purpose too though hot dogs etc are mighty cheep where i live i cycle quite a lot but i prefer to carry muesli bars in pockets and buy isotonic drinks on the go backpacks make sweating much worse for each their own i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cant fathom why people are downvoting it is a cool idea if you exclude the safety implications and its not like anyone is going omg ur gonna die if u doo dat or anything not really worth a downvote imho so ye imma throw in an upvote for your originality
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as far as sweating going youre not gunna be cycling at top speed for go like you would out excising i jog but i wouldnt wear a backpack during that but you also have to remember that the upward speed cap right now is if you want your distance to fully count i typically run faster than that so im willing to bet my right arm that as an avid cyclist you ride a lot quicker than while trailing or wherever you choose to ride im moreso just talking about for a day trip specifically for go purposes for example theres a large outdoor mall near me with about ingress portals throughout it once the game comes out me and my fiancé plan to take frequent day trips to it for the sole purpose of go on my days off wed bring a backpack with some drinks and snacks two power banks and any other necessities we feel like bringing am i saying well never buy lunch or some drinks of course not but if youre out in the heat for hours on a frequent basis a cold drink every half hour adds up pretty quick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its just an entry level xperia thats why they are available for most iphones higher level samsungs and xperia zs no problem still have much less capacity than a decent power bank
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats why i think ill rather be walking or using public transport to get to places with higher pokestop density and get from there bike is going to be more of a nuisance while playing pogo im afraid cant stare at our phone while cycling as fas as sweating goes its here much of the summer so no matter what a backpack makes it worse been there done that its crucial only for hiking trips away from civilization
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its here all summer so no matter what its sweaty and hot so the backpack doesnt make much of a difference i wish it was during the summer here you lucky dog lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im more a or less person so would prefer living in scandinavia or the uk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im with you id prefere best if the temperature was a steady all year round i didnt grow up over here where i trough up was during the summer so im not acclimated to it in the slightest so naked or in full snow gear makes no difference to me just as miserable regardless lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try through this link
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it will probably just be removed rather than moved but of course that solves the problem too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mailed them awhile back about a charmander nest on a local golf course no response what so ever niantic sucks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a business in my area that is incorrectly labeled on the pokemon map as being part of an adjacent park and so it has a bunch of really good spawns in it management is really annoyed by the constant trespassing and theyve suffered some vandalism and theft that probably is related so i suggested they contact niantic to have the stuff removed and ideally relocated to the actual park which has no spawns and could really use them that was about a month ago and so far no action from niantic its worth a try but im not sure theyre doing this stuff anymore that or they have a terrible backlog
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah this is what will happen they will remove it and you will be a bad person golf courses deserve to be walked on anyways for taken up so much space and being such a waste
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me too but the best just changed to meowth so now i dont care
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it likely isnt trespassing unless it is posted or they are like breaking the lock on a fence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are signs posted they do construction and repairs on large vehicles so its quite dangerous to cross right through their property when theyre moving stuff with cranes or transport trucks and forklifts are backing up everywhere its insane what people will do for some good spawns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the event has officially ended now were removing this so it doesnt remain on the frontpage for the next few hours and accidentally mislead any travelers to assume theyre getting the bonus on an evolvespree
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was waiting for this post i wonder what the deadline is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im less than xp from level completely out of evolutions and poke balls my only hope is to farm stops until it ends edit ok i hit level only mins after the event was supposed to end
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here in estwhat the what ive been walking in the rain for not that im complaining
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the event appeared to be over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,idk what to do with myself double lures pokestops at dorm room
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i popped a lucky egg mins before the event was thought to end with only evolves to do thought that was good closure to the grind got over xp during the event please niantic end the event i miss my wife and kids
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should evolve whatever you have if you were waiting for your next mass evolve this is a free lucky egg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it started about to minutes early i wouldnt be at all surprised to see it go a little over the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,stuck inside working all day been out in the rain trying to cram so much xp into these last two hours i have no idea why i thought this endtime prediction would be accurate when the others havent been
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,werent we due for a nest migration today too whats the story there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wonder if they actually meant at utc and they just accidentally put they might have been trying to indicate it would go through the end of the month
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,remember that the previous event also didnt end at the exact hour i think it went several hours over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just started getting per catch and i was planning an evolve tonight heartbroken d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gooood
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,utc we call it gmt should be universal timelimit though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here in aus everyones confused because halloween wasnt defined but this one was so noone knows whats going on thought they would have had it worked out after last events debacle maybe the guy at the desk fell asleep one job press the button at midnight enjoy it while it lasts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is not the first time niantic extended an event they did this with the halloween event also do you think they do this to ease the players back to normal because for me i cant imagine going back to the regular xp and stardust earnings the grind is so depressing at the regular levels that i am ready to put the game down once the event ends
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was going to make a post about this i just tested evolving a pidgey to check if the event was still on got xp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if the event is still ongoing put a lucky egg at the min then burn evaovle away until it reaches the hour time check if it still double xp if yes wait till the next min again and mass evolve again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i never thought it would end at that time anyway they said itd go until the right them starting it earlier than expected was a convince i doubt theyd end it earlier than they said theyd initially would because of that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i bet they will rotate nests and shuffle spawn points when the event ends like they did after the last event or two
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice great time to continue finding ditto these pidgeys are being caught evolved and trashed immediately for xp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think they possibly got the end date mixed up the halloween event was a full week and then some the current event started the afternoon of nov a wednesday if they planned to do another weeklong event it would end this wednesday afternoon in california and maybe they forgot to adjust the date when converting to gmt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,better they should run it a little longer than cut it unexpectedly short like they did with the double item drop event i appreciate the extra time for sure i had a very busy work day capped with a long meeting about real estate taxes because of the time extension i was able to just chill on the train and evolve away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,think it ended in the last minutes or less burned an egg and started flying through as many evolves as i could started out getting double xp minutes ago but the last one i did only gave me with egg up so no event bonus edit okay so the only evolve that i didnt get the bonus was my very last one talk about getting in under the wire
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its over in houston
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,over for me in texas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just ended
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its over for me here i just evolved pidgeys and got only for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just ended in georgia
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im getting stardust on catches here in melb aus i think its ended
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,event is finish here in phil
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was going to mass evolve tonight totally forgot it was a utc thing im a moron
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,another hours then the got the wrong utc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just burned thru my last lucky egg a bit prematurely it seems wasted the last minutes with no evolutions left to do
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hatch some eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ahahaha i feel you ive been walking in degree rain pushing for the last xp i need to hit level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,assuming from your flair that youre in boston i just powered around the common for hours in that rain because of the deadline
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i spent my last min of lucky egg prestiging up a gym to put a pokemon in but i walked away it was taking forever compared to taking a gym down now i see what everyone is complaining about now heading to find some enemy gyms to take down and get my coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i just got xp for catching a venonat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,over here in australia too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hahahah i got xp and am going to make it up to the wife and kids after my benign neglect
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but i have nothing left to evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,next migration should happen sometime thursday evening edit i stand corrected i lost track of what day it was when the last migration happened the next migration should happen on wednesday evening not thursday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the nest migration should be due tomorrow if they are keeping to the regular schedule
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,logically i would have assumed it goes through the end of the month but i assumed these people are engineers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the last event went well over a day extra they didnt have the times for the last event though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought it was gonna last longer hopefully you did well without tonights evolution session
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its kind of a good mistake though i hope theyre hours late finishing every event i know it sucks if youve timed everything to swiss precision or youre simply worn out and want to be put out of your misery but still no harm in going a fraction over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes this is why similar events are dangerous its great to play during them but it feels much less exciting to play with no events going on many people will simply take a break and wait for the xmas event in im guessing weeks of course there could be that gen to shake things up but without it i can see a significant drop off in the next few weeks before another event occurs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the game is fairly dull by now for your casual hardcore players though as many mmos become for this portion of the player case they dont have enough time to grind like crazy to level or dominate the gym scene but they still care about high ivs optimal movesets and tier lists meaning actual casual play is completely uninteresting for them these players are likely now just finishing off their pokedex by either candywalking the last few rare evolutions or hoping for a lucky egg hatch events like these keep those players playing and if it gets them to play hard for a whole week then cool off for a while as they look forward to the next eventcontent update then thats better than just dropping the game entirely due to slowly encroaching boredom as they get sick of constantly waiting for new content im one of these players as i imagine many people here are these events allow me to schedule more of my time into the game for a short period then largely ignore it for a bit but as a result you can bet im coming back to spend my remaining dust when i get some time again or the next updateevent is out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,talk about depressing i grinded all day to get exp with lucky eggs i had no candies to start with and i still need around for next level after the event the game is back on the shelf until a gym update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still havent gotten over not having the candy for walking my buddy man i miss that lol hope they bring it back one day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they said utc on the which was about a half hour ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have no evidence of that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont worry mine had left without evolutions but it was well worth the exp p if it wasnt freezing outside degrees i would have gone for a walk to catch some pokemonpokestops but its very cold
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just did my last offegg to get them done with
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,minutes left at the end with quad xp isnt a waste its minutes of winning i had time at the end to go through transfer all my evolves and do another couple at the end just to pad it out i thought id only get minutes of evolves and still thought it was more than worth it in the end i just split up every candy evolve i had waiting and didnt care about bellsprouts etc into x candy ones and got min
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,had only about evolutions to do and coins away from an egg so i went ahead and evolved them if its still going on tomorrow when i can collect and buy an egg ill rip edit just got from an evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought you were measuring the angle of the rain for a sec there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not in boston but i thoroughly enjoyed the commons wealth of pokemon about weeks ago yall big city folks have it made with varietystopsgymsliving the pokelife😎
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolve it anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah ok thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they had a date for the last event and ran roughly hours over frankly i just dont even not like they can even claim they were pandering to some farout timezone at that point they just seem unable to programmatically control events
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nest change should be coming up thatll either be disappointing or give me something to do for a day or two also someone said something about a game update being due this weekend so if that happens it might add some stuff to be hype about personally ill be traveling soon so itll be fun to try and finish up my medals in a new biome and see if i can secure some more persistent gyms itll suck to be back to regular speed xp but theres always stuff to keep you busy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ohhh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually the words they used were through november until
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,talk about strong winds
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just snort laughed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh man i am glad i didnt see that angle of rain nope talking about temperature
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lets hope maybe this event will roll over for a few extra days like some of the other events fortunately the big level hurdle is over before winter starts to get bad here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the esplanade is solid too theres a huge spawn around the hatch shell that always has something good right now its a ton of growlithe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep hitting the button and it doesnt do anything i think im out of candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they said going through november utc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,take some from children
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i was almost right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is an amazing idea thanks for sharing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can i keep it on in the background while pogo is open
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a lovely idea i dont have a dog but ive downloaded the app and really hope it works with go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,apparently this app is incompatible with all of my devices
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you know how many they give to the shelters and how many they keep for themselves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems like a cool thing for a good cause
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is awesome downloading the app now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kickass thanks for sharing ill definitely be using this when i play
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no prob hope you have the chance to use it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not a beta tester so i cant confirm but its worked with just about every other app ive tried
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh no it also might be us only
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its also incompatible with mine i wish i knew the requirements for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,couldnt tell you for sure but httpwwwwooftraxcomfaq
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i checked that and they didnt mention it which i thought was a bit weird
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the egg type is just a packaging for you when you get the egg the pokemon that will hatch from it is already predertermined dont read too much into the packaging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it seems to me that it is highly unlikely that the game queries your egg collection and modifies the chances for the next egg based on what the current collection is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no correlation ive tracked nearly eggs from the same exact pokéstop since the beginning of this month sometimes i have a full inventory of sometimes i get a couple of and a no patterns whatsoever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i heared it many times but never seen any proof so i am also curious if anyone done some bigger research
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think that lowerlevel players tend to get more eggs as you increase in level you tend to get fewer eggs this might be why you have the impression that you got more eggs when you had more eggs instead you had more eggs because as a lowerlevel player your odds of getting a egg were higher
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,right to further expound on this you get a pokemon from a pokestop it just so happens that its in an egg whatever the mons egg distance is is the type of egg you get ie also from a logic stand point it doesnt really make sense to base what you get from a pokestop on what you already have niantic isnt out there going you have eggs have another
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm good point but i think it has to query your eggs as how would it know if you needed one or not how does it check if you only have eggs so the pokestop can give you an egg when you spin it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks did you happen to post your data on your eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm then i should be getting more eggs at level but i only get
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,checking for an empty slot is much easier than checking for the make up of the inventory and modifying the rng based on that makeup
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive since hatched about more that ive yet to chart out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i should too no i was only talking about eggs being more common for lowerlevel players i sure wish it also meant that higherlevel players would get more eggs and that they wouldnt include onix like i got today i just keep telling myself that steelix will be terrific but it doesnt help much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it can be done with api call
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats because elekid is and since you obtained him from an egg the blank spaces for the other pokemon appeared
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can we make a gamble game for how much this kind of thread will pop up in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whoaaa i cant believe youre late to the party
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can you pm me if you ever find a dratini spawn point or a nest thanks im trying to figure out where exactly dratini spawn now so tha i can predict locations info such as population close to water climate etc would be nice as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will and ill also be very excited myself have none so far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are right any gym alteration or added rewards will not change the fact that the stronger players will still be the most dominant maybe low level players will get motivated for a day or two but then that would fizzle down and which ever team has the most players around will still dominate the area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre ignoring neighborhood occupational bias player x lives across the street from a park and is within range of gym a from his living room person y works at pizza place z which is a gym urban neighborhood has gyms within a few blocks there are active mystic players in this neighborhood and a couple valorinstinct these are permanent gyms for that team regardless of effort expended by opposing teams up to a certain threshold were talking about resources in the form of time and potions if it takes the resources for the same perceived reward its reasonable to qualify that gym as untakeable anyone who is arguing gym stagnation isnt a problem is in an area where it really isnt a problem or youre choosing to play the game in a way that the current stagnation benefits you and you dont want to play in a balanced game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if all gyms were level it would actually maximize free coins output
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,should successful countries in the olympics be handicapped due to their success no you just have to learn to deal with that there is no way to solve the team balance issue without making the problem much worse however the current system encourages migration which allows all teams to become dominant in my town all three teams have their own territories which allows anyone fairly dedicated to pogo to battle in gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then the case is with the ratio of players in each team any gym alteration would still benefit the team with the most players in a certain area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when an event like that ends or starts they substitute the spawn table with a whole new table so anything you see at the moment before the change can turn into anything else it happens to nests when a nest migration appears too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha it sounds like some confusion from the game due to the event ending never heard of pokemon evolving in the environment who knows
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught a squirtle the other day and it changed into a marill ugh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess the spawntable changed due to the beginning event and it was pure rng that it changed to an evolution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i watched a teddyursa turn into octillery at the start of the event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can confirm but a little different a totodile spawned and after selecting it and catching it the new pokedex entry appeared and ive just caught a feraligatr i was a little pissed because i was saving the new entry for a lucky egg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,were removing this post as its a frequently asked question friend a few players have reportedly spoofed locations and taken a legitimate field tester slot there is no data populating the map outside japan ausnz and the us cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol psa p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i posted this minutes ago and got a bunch of downvotes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ps location doesnt matter the rollout is always to a random percentage of users at a time you can be in any location on any device and be the first or last to get it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,godspeed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine updated through play store this morning about hours ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anyone know what the integrated ios wheelchair support for use with apple watch is all about im on android so its pure curiosity but i do use a wheelchair so would love more accessibility features as there are often places i simply cannot get to that ablebodied people can maybe therell be a giant kerb or an old building more likely to behave a pokestop might just not be accessible at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pps most people grab the update from apkmirror rather than wait for the play store
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is there any reason to put off updating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got a citation there for most im a frequent silph road visitor and well aware of apkmirror but i dont really care about getting the updates that fast especially minor updates so i just wait for the play store to give it to me i would expect that the majority of pokemon go players dont even know apkmirror exists
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a particularly nasty bug with the app crashing when youre trying to view your avatar see some discussion here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive heard people having issues with the app crashing when looking at medalsjournal but no issues for me on my nexus i cant think of another reason not to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no you can still revert to the previous version if your phone has errors with checking medalsjournal or it starts crashing on load like it did two versions ago the load time is much faster and if you have a plus it works much much better
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,considering that the apkmirror threads are more consistently posted than the update hit the play store and given how much some people try to avoid using the search function i know wed have a ton due to staged roll outs if the majority of tsr users werent grabbing the apk that its a safe bet i wanted this update asap quicker loading times and plus support but for example korean language i just grabbed from the store i remember when the buddy system update came out that all the people in our group who were android grabbed the apk and showed it off to the apple people youre probably right that majority of pogo players dont check apkmirror since a large chunk of players arent even in any fan forums let alone tsr
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres no guarantee to hatch any pokemon from eggs youre just unlucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hatched three in a row from eggs a while ago you sir are having a bad run that being said im yet to find or hatch a drowsee
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,have you been getting eggs from one general area maybe try getting eggs from a different area i generally get all my eggs in one town but couldnt get any starters so i started collecting eggs in another town and now im getting pikachu and charmander
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so i am a firm believer that your egg spawn table is determined by the spawn table in the location of the pokestop you get your egg at im in the process of testing this with some people just curious have you also never caught one in the wild
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my area gets a pretty wide assortment of pokemon theres just no stops to stock up to catch them i see the following pokemon pretty commonly bellsprout oddish drowzee eevee and clefairy and obviously weedle caterpie and pidgey occasionally ill see water types which is weird because the only water nearby is a creek
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive hatched drowsee want to trade
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i literally get my eggs from all over the place barely ever go to the one spot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught plenty in the wild all have had terrible ivs so were just candy fodder
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure all i get from eggs are sandshrew
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,new logos like always p this time we have canada denmark finland iceland norway sweden sb from the western europe discord ask me to change sth in the logo of switzerland to make it better maybe you like it if you wanna have a certain logo of a country ask me here i will try to make in within the next updates next will be portugal greece ukraine romania see you d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice man can you do one to brazil
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,amazing want a patch of the canada one for my go backpack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,australia pls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks dude
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and dont trust the preview xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure sb already asked before i try to put it into the next update otherwise the update after it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will see if this is somehow possible are you on the discord server of thesilphroad would have some questions about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,will be there when in australia its saturday morningmidday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you have experience making models for printers i dont but i have a friend with a printer and i would really like to print the canada one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,send you a pm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think people bot to make money and people spoof to enjoy the game in a downtown environment like los angeles you can not differentiate between a legit and nonlegit player so welcome to my life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive chased off spoofers before you just have to be persist make them realize they cant hold a gym in your area for very long and theyll move on to somewhere they can hold gyms i believe ive gotten rid of mystic spoofers this way it takes a few weeks usually but they got sick of seeing big red towers everywhere and moved on im assuming bots are different since theyre automatic and not being directly controlled by someone theres a suspected valor bot in a town north of me thats been running for months its level and growing whoever set it up probably just forgot about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it sucks i know someone is spoofing because i was at a gym with no trees around and by a lake its a really great spot i take down a gym only to have it knocked down i thought i was the only one there i looked around in all directions nobody was anywhere in sight then the spoofers place pokémon in the gym after i knock it down again they place a bunch of regionals in there i drove around town looking at different gyms they were all populated by the same names the last gym i came across had a kangaskhan in the tiers now ive seen all the regionals ill never get i put in a report as im sure many have the last few times i drove by the lakeside gym ive noticed its empty i suspect players have just given up putting a pokémon in there now that they know a spoofer regularly frequents it like i said it sucks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well this has been going on a week now my goal is to keep taking them down so local instinct players dont build them up once i see local players jump in i go out and take them down i passed one level tower last night that i will likely take down this weekend but that is not my area so i cant watch it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,either it is luck o it is a dratini spawnpoint in water biomes where dratini normally spawns it is just random i have waterspawnpoints next to my house and sometimes there are dratini in one hour then sometimes not a single dratini appears in days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that is what is known as a frequent spawn it is one lone spawn point that has a consistent single spawn of a certain species they stopped doing dratini nests on the first or second migration ever for obvious reasons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats a spawn different to a nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is no such thing as a dratini nest or spawn point anymore nests and spawn points are essentially the same thing by the way a nest is just a collection of many spawn points of the same species what you experienced is nothing more than coincidence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,has the omanyte spawn point been spawning omanyte since before the migration sounds like both points are frequent spawn points which some consider to by a type of nest they are reportable on the nest atlas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the omanyte is a frequent spawn point i believe frequent spawn point have a rate of so times sound right dratini spawns at water biome at a rate of so it should spawn at a rate of once every two day for your other spawn point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nest change every two weeks are in parks typically and can catch them frequently in that duration dratini do not nest dratini are typically specific to water biomes you may catch one an hour you may not see one all day its a low possibility spawn most research says aroud so if you get a couple a day youre doing good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a typical water spawn point spawns one dratini every two days on average not necessarily at the same hour but definitely at the same minute of the hour as every spawn point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have spawnpoints that i can access from my livingroom plus four more with a bit of drift the dratini has been at this particular spawnpoint for the past days at around the same time thats just odd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dunno why you got downvoted because youre correct
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope i used to be surrounded by goldeen before the migration there was an omanyte spawn in the building next door but i had to run outside to catch it ive reported it as potential frequent spawnnest on the map and will add times once i have them if they are always at the same time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i have a jynx frequent spawn point next to my work that spawns approximately of the time a day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok frequent spawn point sounds better than nest thanks for that the dratini is odd though as ive seen it around the same time for the past days that doesnt sound random does it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i currently get about per day one outside at least when im at home and one with a short sprint to a spawn point nearby phew just two more needed for the final evolution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it could be just rng or maybe you are into something i would advise you to take note of every spawn you can in the next x days time and species and maybe of the points near and then post the results in this subreddit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,who knows silphroad i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting ive tried reporting frequent spawn points near me on the atlas but ive found a lot of users seem to have trouble comprehending the concept its like if it isnt a high yielding nest where they can get of the nesting pokemon within minutes they refute it ugh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its certainly not a nest you just live in a wateresque area congrats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i started that on saturday evening of course after the second dratini spawn but i keep track on my spawns whenever im at home shame though that this spawn has always been around just before and im usually working then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im just on the edge of the town centre minutes walking not many people come here been holding two gyms for two days now never seen a nest with mass spawns yet though the max was double bulbasaurs in a park teaming with bulbies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep lots of water outside lucky this chap though only showed up after the nest rotation never had a dratini outside before since moving in weeks ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm maybe its luck or something couldve changed serverside we now see clefairy spawn downtown that never did before and thus have given way to aerodactyl and dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting ive seen a few clefairy as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then keep your eyes peeled dragonite couldb e lurking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am would be so cool to finally get my first dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyre a pain to catch but incredibly worth it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been wondering this same thing the gym near my house is usually a maxed out mystic gym my roommate and i went to try to take it down and only got it to level in just a matter of minutes it was maxed out again it would be hard to say which players are real vs bots in this instance there are so many mystic players that its plausible some of them were added by actual players that passed by the gym near my house never has people around anymore though which is why i doubt the authenticity in the first place
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spoofers maybe botted i dunno at this time its very possible for a player to have multiple dragonites playing legit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,op said random user names nbsp tread carefully here but if youve got multiple usernames that are nearly the same then you should consider reporting the usernames by going to this page nbsp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sound like a noob
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hope he gets banned for life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how is that even fun at that point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that sucks i hope they fix this problem at some point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks i think ill just report them individually and let niantic figure it out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,suspicious because it takes some time to go from lvl to and in that time they should have seen the group of advisaries required to power lvl a gym back to as they had witnessed i remember hearing about a reporting feature but i do not have knowledge of its use
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because more than gyms got to level with full dragonites overnight
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what about a guy with snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can report individual users in the link that is posted in another comment above
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen crews of people drive around my turn and do that in itself that doesnt tell you anything about if theyre cheating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,suspicion proof
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have snorlaxes and about candy before i maxed one and im fairly casual at level as long as you live in the correct biome and had a tracker it isnt that hard however if say a guy has dragonites and you are nowhere near a dratini yeah id say hes cheating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,correct i just wanted to see if there was a way to report a suspicious gym instead of suspicious users but it looks like there isnt niantic can figure out the rest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes according to the calc its ivs congrats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wheres the calc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for future reference post this kind of content to rpokemongoivs congrats on your iv perfect mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpsthesilphroadcomresearch go to iv rater
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you mean something like this sorry i had no time and was in a rush i think most of the logos were created for only
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no i do mean the ones that everyone is making pins and art for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sidenote i had a couple people mention making custom phone cases from these designs and if you decide you want to feel free but id appreciate it if youd buy me a coffee thanks and hope you guys like them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice i ended up making my own similar to yours for a lock screen moved some things around to fit my best and also made an inside homescreen so you swipe the kanto pokedex open all the widgets and apps are laid out on top of the screen to fit then tapping on the optical sphere of the dex launches the camera app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats pretty neat thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thnaks now i got dexter now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can you make a black and red kanto dex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heyo four ish requests if possible could you do the gen dex but base the pokeball part off of the diveluxury ball gray background and friendsafari ball brown background these look great btw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if i can i have a simple request can you make a team rocket gen pokedex plz i was thingies all blackish with a red r but have some fun im sure i can find some spare change and fund your habit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,feels kind of lonely without the kalos dex though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,any chance of the inside of the first gen pokedex so i can use that as my home screen as well thanks and good work ps i have an iphone not sure if that matters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sidenotesidenote for the unova pokedex id be happy to add in your favorite pokemon entry on the screen if people contact me about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,now that is fantastically cool im a little limited with my iphone but i absolutely adore that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,done just open the album again and it should be at the end
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure i think i can come up with something the kanto one is slightly tougher since its originally just the one color but ill experiment black as the main accent or still red as the prominent color
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can sure do my best thats actually a great request i think itll be a super fun challenge ill work on those tomorrow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ooh i should be able to do that no problem that should be tons of fun to do
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill probably do that after i finish some of the alternates
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sidenotesidenotesidenote last one i promise ill also do color requests because why not if you want a specifically colored pokedex from these designs just let me know and ill make up a color scheme im a graphic design student so this kind of exercise is great
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awesome thank you so much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damnit i like the pink one but didnt realize it was for girls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,black as prominent please thanks a bunch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pink is for everybody go go go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just cause the female characters in the games picked it doesnt mean that a guy irl cant p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tough thing about the kanto dex because it has so few areas for accentsis generally all the same color multiple colors can come out looking really odd but i did my best i futzed around with the color scheme in general to make it all a little more coherentgo together better colorwise httpiimgurcomyvujbkujpg let me know if youd like any tweakscolor changes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its awesome thank you so much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it only transforms from rattata pidgey zubat and magicarp families so if you see any of those frequently youre likely to encounter ditto
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught ditto no rhyme or reason to any of them from what i can see first one was in a residential neighborhood on a random street ratatta ditto second one was in a different residential neighborhood on a random street ratatta ditto third one was at my work pidgey ditto fourth one was in a mall parking lot pidgey ditto
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught around pokémon during the event and i mostly focused on the big four where i could pidgey rattata zubat magikarp not a single ditto i also vote biome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught a ditto while walking at my local university heshe whatever was disguised as a ratata lvl middle of the city in what you could almost call a local park i dont see whats so special about ditto but ive got him
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught ditto total and of them were at my house or very very close the other were in the next town over from me the right at home are what is unusual to me i havent even hunted a lot for them so imagine how many i missed i live in a neighborhood where nothing besides rattata weedle and pidgey ever seems to spawn maybe i see an occasional venonat worst area everuntil ditto came along i got ditto that popped up when i was just randomly checking the app while sitting on the couch in my living room a ratatta was reachable so i caught it another was in the driveway when the family and i got home from a restaurant was at the house next door when i happened to open the app i caught running errands just a block or two from my house while i was in the post office and home depot parking lots i took a minute and caught a few ratatta and were ditto of the i caught at or near my house were rattata and was a pidgey im voting biome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i only managed to snag two ditto one was at a park in a neighboring city next to a pokestop rattata and the other was at a mall next to the park in the parking lot in a huge cluster spawn of rattata pidgey and paras rattata again ive failed to find one in my own town even after searching every day since the event started first nights i caught literally every pokemon second two nights i caught every pidgey rattata and zubat i saw still no luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just caught my ditto disguised as a rattata ive caught as rattatas as pidgeys and as a magikarp it took me about km of walking over xp and about hours of searching before i found my first one i went out and searched for about hours right after i saw he was in the wild and didnt find one till the next night i believe its totally random ive heard of lots of people that found one instantly but i also have heard of other people that still havent found any at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught quite a number of rats and pidgys but was able to confirm that if a mon is a ditto others will catch the ditto as well players including myself all caught the same pidgy ditto and they all were dittos ive not noticed a biome yet personally
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looks like there is no explanation yet on the spawn mechanic according to usyfyfan experience with ditto biome is the most plausible answer pidgeys and rats are the most ditto carrier confirmed lets just pray we will get answers soon thanks for sharing guys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you for keeping me accompany
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty much unless the defender has a slow move like confusion but it makes sense you shouldnt be able to freely switch pokémon with no disadvantage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you dodge while switching youll take the reduced damage as though the switchedin pokemon had dodged it even though theres no animation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the switch duration is so if you could instantaneously queue up the switch you wouldnt get hit but realistically yeah youre going to take at least one hit unless its one of the slowest moves but i agree that its super annoying i wish that you could make the switch in the short time before the next defender comes out but nope the whole button goes away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hasnt it always been this way though where the window to dodge the next hit is incredibly small
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldnt complain if it was just to my skill but this is definitely a technical issue except its not impossible and is almost certainly a product of your skill i would suggest using ar and positing the pokémon in the bottom corner of your phone it takes adjusting but it works
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would suggest using ar and positing the pokémon in the bottom corner of your phone it takes adjusting but it works this also i found turning the phone upside down and dragging down the ball to throw it also a decent method just move your finger ball in hand somewhat slowly to the topleft corner from the bottomright if you go fast enough but not super fast you should be able to get it and this cover as much distance with your finger as possible extremely fast throws dont register the entire distance ps and less rage its just a game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see a lot of suggestion below and i just give you more once your phone gets android nougat i know its still in beta force enable split screen for all appsonce pogo is on half of the screen just a very light flick makes these long shots a piece of cake im using it daily on my since my work place is currently a scyther nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,golbat scyther dragonite etc are all a piece of cake compared to rapidash
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,might sound unfair but git gud use both hands and learn the proper technique its definitely not a technical issue and possible on any phone to hit far away pokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you could do what i do just ignore those pokemon and move on to easier targets mind you my wife got me a pogo so now i let it target those impossible to hit pokemon for me the attack animation timing the breakout routines and the fleeing make it not fun to mess with those pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think it may be your skill how youre level and have had such an problem is almost baffling im not trying to sound like a prick but its not too hard lightly flinging the ball works or curve it and go from one lower corner and drag it all the way to the exact opposite top corner ex bottom left to top right and let her rip that works great too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first your title is incorrect it is absolutely possible and in fact is probable using the right technique there are several detailed threads with pics on the topic if you search but here is the basic summary drag the pokeball to a bottom corner i am left handed so use the bottom left corner throw the ball almost straight up that along the outer side but with a slight arc towards the center this technique works of the time for dragonites golbats zubats etc in the rare case that the pokemon is not catchable using the method above switch to ar mode and position the pokemon at the bottom of the screen some prefer to position it in the corner practice both techniques on zubat and you will have less trouble
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am rarely able to hit stuff flying at a distance when throwing curve balls ive never had any trouble throwing straight balls though i know curve balls give you better chances but lately i havent been getting credit for half of them that i throw anyway i assume that means that i am not getting the additional percentage when i throw them without getting the credit so i just throw straight balls at bats rapidash ponyta etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was reminded of this i think its in there somewhere that someone posted the imgur link of the superlong curvespinup technique for catching dragonite that also applies here some dude in australianew zealand who claims to have caught wild dragonite in any case theyre a pain in the butt to catch but definitely doable i usually get them in throws or fewer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,couple of things you can try make sure your phone case or screen protector if you have either one is not stopping your finger from reaching the edgetop of the screen throw when the pokemon starts to jump the throw goes further when a pokemon is jumping with a bit of practice you should be able to get the timing right this also helps avoid throwing when the pokemon is about to attack i curve ball everything and find that looking at the top corner where i want to release the ball as im throwing helps me be more accurate with the far away and high ones i have read some people turn their phone upside down and i tried but it didnt work for me it might for you though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do an anti clockwise spin at degrees and then quickly flick my whole arm out way past my phone sometimes a phone case prohibits the throw so i have to take it off if i dont reach the pokémon its because i didnt flick my whole arm far enough practice it i taught it to this kid who was bad the first few times but hes now got the hang of it and says it really works i used to use the ar method before this but i find this method much less awkward and thus more reliable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i didnt read your wall of text but its easy as its practise im big on hunting dragonite and for the most part ive caught all of the ones ive ever found which is more than i care to say because ill get labelled as a cheating spoofer which isnt the case at all the trick is to do a curve ball get the curve swinging around and round and then give a good flick from the bottom of one corner to the top of the other corner it does take practise but youll get the hang of it the more you do it and be able to reach the far away pokemon like dragonite dragonair golbat ect once you get the hang of it its seriously easy as i do long curves with everything for the extra catch bonus and its easier to me now than throwing straight
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you just need practice in september i wasted more than ultraballs on a single dragonite and at that time i thought my screen was too small to catch it two or three months later i met another dragonite but my throwing skills had improved caught the beast in no time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,weird i feel like this was fixed in i used to have issues with pony and one or two others but moved them closer to the screen and are no longer an issue for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know what you mean i can hit dragonite times on my buddys iphone but more like on my android choppy framerate screws everything up for me even when it looks smoothish its still hard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not impossible try the slingshot trick move the ball from the bottom to the top then quickly again to the bottom then quickly to the top updownuprelease my hit rate has gone from almost zero to with this method and never ever waste an ultra ball ie the black and yellow one on a golbat or pidgeot razz berry and great ball if you really want it normal pokéball without berry if youre just practicing for when you meet a lapras or dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the culture of our subreddit over the months has been a real outlier on reddit folks have been courteous and friendly here with the new influx of subscribers and pokefans we want to encourage our newest travelers to help us keep the culture on the road one of friendly constructive dialogue and yes its not easy to catch a golbat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah golbats a toughie its even almost as far as dragonite so itll give you a tough time the trick to catching those far away ones is remembering that realworld physics dont apply so the speed at which you move your finger doesnt matter too much just move your finger ball in hand somewhat slowly to the topleft corner from the bottomright if you go fast enough but not super fast you should be able to get it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are some phones where it really is impossible i have a cheap burner phone ill use if my main was to run out of battery and you literally cannot hit a scyther normally its possible to do if you throw at the end of a jump its a screen issue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,like ujakeeric said i can guarantee you its absolutely impossible to catch some pokemon on certain phones your trick does work but its not an optimal way to throw a ball and it shouldnt be required to do it this way in any case
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its just a golbat ftfy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,might i add that i have great success on an iphone with doing a large slow loop prior toin conjunction with releasing the ball so instead of small tight circles prior to release just one long slow wide circle and then release you get more release timedistance that way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok thats a nice idea thx ill have a look at it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i found ninetails the hardest to hit compared to that rapidash seems quite easy now but this isnt terribly scientific as i havent seen many ninetails in the wild to be precise both ultimately ran
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah dood never had a problem hitting anything bottom left top right curveball highly successful not to say i dont believe people are having a hard time some phones are just different
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,totally agree its not that difficult ive caught golbats at poytas one handed while running using just the thumb so that i dont break my stride cant speak to dragonites cause ive never seen one i think people have the impression that flicking harder is the solution but it just takes a light flick in the shape of an italic lower case d to get pretty much anything with a curve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for what its worth my phone is from and i have issues hitting far away pokemon when it lags motorola nexus disables half the processors below battery when my phone is lagging it doesnt register my finger correctly and doesnt realize the full velocity of my throw making it impossible to catch far away pokemon i experienced this last august walking around the boardwalk with my phone screen on for hours it got really hot degree battery temperature severe lag found a wild blastoise and could not reach it with a pokeball with some patience i ended up getting lucky but my skill was not to blame for the issue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,okay obviously hes not being literal some people in this thread are really being pedantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly it has to be one single long light and very smooth motion also take your time between throws breathe aim throw repeat rage doesnt help
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you can hit get him then its not impossible nor can you literally not hit plus the ar mode trick i mentioned will work regardless of phone size
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not true ive caught dragonites with curve balls on anything from an iphone a samsung tablet a huawei whatever that garbage is and some other random phones people hand me im known as the dragonite whisperer around here because i have so many i didnt come up with the name but its pretty fitting it can be done on anything its all about the technique in doing it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after this discussion i have no idea what impossible means anymore so ill take your word for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive had no problems hitting ninetails in the past but still found it very difficult due to it somehow being able to deflect nearly every ball that landed rapidash on the other hand is so damn skinny that its impossible to throw a ball straight enough always misses slightly to the left or right and curveballs dont work because its just too far away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive never used that analogy the lower case d is the best way to describe it and dragonite is just as big of a pain to catch next time though she better watch out shes gonna get that d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but here you identified the problem your phone was somewhat outdated and on a hot day it was far from good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so why does it work on my old phone then when its just my skill but thx for the ar tip ill try it out as soon as i encounter my next one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre being a little pedantic here what i said had a qualifier on the end of it it wont work regardless of phone ive never had a phone where ar worked not all phones have a gyroscope
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i swear i will actually send you my phone if we split the shipping you will see some phones do not work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this sentence combined with the fact you made the dragonite female makes me feel uncomfortable about your thoughts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well sure but i was astonished that certain game mechanics were altered pokeball throw distance from just a moderate amount of lag this was before the pogo came out which would have helped but even so paying to play the game with the screen off is a bit ridiculous in itself in any case it doesnt warrant being so condescending to op you yourself acknowledged you sounded like a prick lag happens and its not always apparent when its happening
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the skill is a perphonetype skill people can do it on both your phones but the finer details that youve learned on one of your phones need to be adjusted for the other i play on several phones occasionally and after a few bad throws it reminds me not to rely on how i throw on my own phone screen surface phone speed touch resolution and screen size all change how the phone registers your gestures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know what to tell you man if you can hit him sometime then youre doing something different the other times i enjoy the challenge of far away pokémon now hello rapidash i used to have a problem at first but you get a hang of it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not paying the shipping for that haha but if you do ill get you some dragonites and snorlax for the trouble
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it or he wouldve sounded more strange oddish even
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a galaxy and it felt like the phone was going to incinerate itself in the early days of pogo updates in time have stopped that from happening now the only times it feels off for mechanics is in crappy service which i fully expect and you shouldnt have to feel forced to buy the plus i refuse to get it personally and finally i said not to sound like a prick as in im trying to help you and not sound condescending my cousin had similar catch issues on his iphone cant remember what version he has and after showing him a few tricks he was fine this was when he was in the late for levels too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the ball goes further when the pokémon jumps so its possible to hit them when theyve just jumped most of the time its impossible
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if i were in your shoes size us preferably id keep it as it is for its sheer novelty
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolve get brick break cry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been contemplating the same thing with my perfect togepi
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you i like you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey we have the same shoe size
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,happened with my santachu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,out of my santachus evolved into raiclaus with brick break i cry everytime
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,confirmation bias
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have pretty much the exact opposite feeling i only ever played redblue but im super excited to meet all the new pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no because it would be childish and petty i want the entirety of generation before generation of course but if it doesnt work out that way im not going to quit the game what an absurd overreaction
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if gen really does come out in december then niantic did not live up to its promises based on the advertising we saw before release so i wont be continuing with the game what promise are you talking about i dont wish for the game to be contaminated with nongen pokemon before thats complete you can just play rby if you want a gen only experience so badly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this post is a joke right please take your complaints to pokemongo subreddit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why is tsr becoming rpokemongo 😢 i myself am quitting pogo if niantic doesnt bring me a latte in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldnt have a problem if they got around to releasing thirdgen pokémon before firstgen legendaries if it means we avoid seeing the meta flooded with overpowered legendaries id rather niantic take their time working out all the kinks in the gym system before introducing new half baked pokémon into an already unbalanced meta im also perfectly fine with them holding off on introducing further generations at all for the very same reason id rather see the meta stabilise and the list of gym viable pokémon expand before they toss another characters at us and only end up giving us that are actually competitive early adopters of this game have become so obsessed with new content that theyre willing to sacrifice the quality of existing content in order to get it its frustrating seeing people clamouring for new pokémon when the game has barely reached a point where its stable reliable and equally rewarding of consistent casual play as it is grinders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is not rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,boohoo watch this tantrum i make because i dont know the new pokemons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol hell no theres no way im even getting close to finishing my pokédex anytime soon more pokémon would make it so much more fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for me i did stay interested till gen and it wasnt so much that i lost interest but i gained interested in other things but in either case even from a gen purist perspective i would prefer they do legendary pokémon the right way rather than rush it out there is an obvious need for more content at this point gen would be an easier rollout compared to other options as theres already a base structure to work from with the gen setup and there are those that believe theyve been testing and preparing for it with recent events and changes on the flip side for legendary pokémon it really has be done right theres a really fine line of making sure they fit into the battling meta as strong contenders without completely overtaking it and they have to have a balance between extreme rarity and accessibility i just dont want them to rush a decision and we end up with either everyone having all legendary pokémon and thats all you see in gyms or where theres chance to get of them and if you cant get it then you miss you chance and for other major things like trade and pvp those are brand new mechanics which again i want them to do it right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ha ha no are you serious
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sortof the same my memory is a bit fuzzy but i think i played up to where i started to get bored pokemon are pretty cool and much in line with the latest stuff seems really weird and off the wall i wont be stopping playing though cos im a hopeless addict
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i didnt play only saw the cartoon a bit so mostly just familiar with what those in the know call gen but its a game i expect to have to learn stuff new characters new attributes strategies techniques rules etc i also am not a completionist as that comes with an end id rather continue playing than have an artificial end point that could be affected by things you describe additional pokemon wont negatively impact me other than having unfamiliar names to punch into the app which tells me weaknesses but in a few weeks theyll be familiar names just like last july
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im laying low until some kind of competition level pvp is introduced is just stats in different skins to me and thats stats that dont really matter much anyway in this youcanbeateverythingwithanything tap fest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,regardless of when legends are released there will be a mass exodus of genoners just like you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im struggling to see the logic in your thinking so the legendaries dont come out and gen pops and suddenly drop everything ill happily take and when the birds come out get those too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,define complete
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i need more to complete my dex and i may quit for the opposite reason im bored with these mons bring on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,side note its been awhile since i watched through the whole original series but from an anime standpoint with the exception of vague murals they dont show the legendary birds until the lugia movie where gen is well established at that point technically the first legendary we see is hooh just not explicitly defined at that time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,more pokémon means more hunting they could start skipping around gens and i wouldnt care this is a mobile game about hunting and evolving pokémon adding more is absolutely a positive thing stop your childish reasons of mah pokémon arent all out and play the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope i love gen and i hate legendary pokemon anyway so i dont really care really not looking forward to see every gym stacked with mewtwos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id never played or watched pokemon only knew the names of or until i started playing this with my son i dont care how many gens they release or when they do it im just having fun catching them ifwhen i quit playing itll be because i stop having fun or find something more fun to do and im not likely to announce it to the world if you enjoy playing then play if not then quit peace out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont mind if they dont release certain legendaries before gen i will say that if they dont have an event that makes catching certain superrare mons like porygon chansey and lickitung easier before gen my motivation to play will almost certainly evaporate imagine if when gold came out you just couldnt catch certain pokemon in red anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,totally agree im also a gen guy and could care less about gen would be silly to release a new gen without first completing the previous one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i played gen and like them both but i will eb upset if gen hits before they are done with gen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems pretty silly to me too i have only caught about of the pokedex but am keen to see some more diversity
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what joke dont you always quit things when you dont get your way too s
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah id be happy if they added all the prepost evolutions that branch from the original a good chunk of them are in gen but others are way out there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,of course p s
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aw dang i didnt get one not yet confirmed on the silph roads twitter account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im going to assume they arent anywhere near done sending out invites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this makes me sad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can confirm this is exactly what a friends email looked like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so bitter right now i dont even want to play doom or overwatch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats correct considering i didnt get my invite yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic is sorry to inform you that there was a typo when you submitted your email and included your ingress account name due to that you have been disqualified as a spambot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i left it blank because i couldnt remember it ingress is boring
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spambots unite charge niantic headquarters and take those beta invites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry ive captured over million spawns and ive never noticed any correlation in time of day i have a seperate data set for after the recent migration and still i see no correlations randomness
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,regardless of what people say i catch more zubats and drowzee at night maybe the research says otherwise on a large scale but without a doubt in my specific situation its true i live in a biome where they are already common spawns but night compared to day is like the difference between a biome and a nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,regardless of the ops edits i have also observed this ive been tracking a bulbasaur nest since the migration and it doesnt begin spawning bulbasaurs until after until like clockwork never before that based on days of cycles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,has anyone seen this prior to the recent nest migration if not i feel like this is another step in the prepare yourself gen is coming buddy systemfriendship fleshed out daynight cycle with nighttime spawnsand apparently nests even
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,similar to my kabuto nest its rarely spawns during the day but as soon as night time hits on the app i think around pm they spawn a lot more frequently per hour compared to the every few hours during the day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a charmander nest close to my work seems to have siesta from noon until spawning no or very few charmanders during those hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ironicially the kabuto nest near me is the opposite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does anything different nest there during the daytime hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes my town has a sandshrew nest that only is active during evening spawns same time every hour
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,personally i have a pair of spots that spawn various water types karp duck tent but only after pm when i have gone earlier they just are not there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my anecdotal evidence since the migration there is a spot that only at night spawns scyther from one specific pokestop there in an hour two nights ago and one i happened upon last night no idea of frequency or timing but scyther doesnt spawn that often where i am from
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was going to post my own thread about this today i feel like two nests here have become limited in their time the strange thing is one seems to activate in the to hour its only a small nest on a golf course but its seel which is very unusual here so when you see them on the scanner its easy to notice i had been watching from work today and really didnt seem them until and now ive seen regularly its possible ive missed the spawn during the day but now i have the time down i will look tomorrow and confirm i was also watching another golf course for new nest activity and during the day it didnt seem like there was any rhyme or reason but now i see vulpix at once that is another rare spawn here so the odds of that being just random is very low
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my clefairy nest only spawns multiple at the same time during the night only every hour during day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this happened today here to add more anecdotical evidence i checked a supposed charmander nest with a tracker twice during the day both times i saw charmanders on the map for the span of each time i looked at it i got to the spot late in the evening and was surrounded by charmanders within a distance of around when the in game map switch to night time the crazy charmander spawns stopped i stayed there for another half hour and only caught charmanders one of which wasnt in that before mentioned diameter edit checking the park again around midnight shows that they seem to be on a cycle with a long downtime theyre popping up in and again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spawns are universal for all users and you can force your app into night mode by changing your devices clock so what you mean is it goes into bublaaur mode after local
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the comic for today has never been more fitting as if the cosmos wished to corroborate your findings another bulba just spawned in the nocturnal nest so there goes that theory thank you so much for the incredible insight d that is a lot of spawns holy balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have a separate dataset for the newest patch but i just thought of something what if it is only the nests that are time dependent and if theyre only active for hours at a time can you do me a huge favor and run a query on the bulbasaur spawns very near and then look to see if there is a correlation to time for the latest patch dataset im wondering if perhaps the nests are just such a small subset of the overall number of spawns that theyre getting lost in the huge dataset thanks in advance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after the new migration youre not seeing anything like windows where certain nests are active of daily spawns are between for example people have been talking a lot about bursts of nest spawns now and youre in a pretty rare position to disprove that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this would be new though i am not positive myself but i have a good contender to scan with not much data yet but someone found a pikachu nest in mesa az last night and i have a screenshot in this small park where there were at once last night then i scanned to confirm and there were two at however weve seen none when scanning during the day today latitude longitude doesnt show as a park on google maps but it is on osm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn bruh cool coolz tell us more about your data set
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup theres a bulbasaur nest here that is daytime only not worth the struggle to convince others but when farming them i went home at sharp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are you from time zone central mountains perhaps the only time zone that makes sense is niantics own
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not nocturnal nests but prior to the latest migration all the nests i found followed a pattern nests stop spawning at night if the park closed at night the nests that were in open parks stayed spawning i dont think its a new mechanic probably just more obvious with refinements in their spawn algorithms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,previous to the last migration there was a kabuto nest at william and mary university that only started at night and ended im the morning theres been a few more but that was the most defined one i know of for am exact example
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe not in the form of nests but ghastly is much more likely to spawn at night
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes it is very interesting behavior i wonder if there is any correlation between the types of pokemon that spawn at night in nests and the tv show remember that one episode where the bulbasaurs were all going to the moon festival thingy at night and the kabutos were found in caves iirc so thatd make them nocturnal too is this the beginning of more targeted spawn conditions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well pm is when the game goes into night mode so that makes sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we dont propagate tools that rely on illicit access to niantics servers on the road cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was totally wrong just a few days of coincidence now that i think about it youre completely right it makes sense for there to be a given time when things spawn more since that would imply youd get night pokemon during the day on the other side of the world thanks for pointing that out totally forgot about that aspect of it just got caught up in wishful thinking nocturnal pokemon sounded so cool to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not looking near your area but i promise thats not how any nests work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i shouldnt say none because i just saw one so either its slower during the day or last night was an lucky time when all the spawn points were spitting them out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eastern im not saying the timezone makes sense im just saying there appears to be some stuff that spawns at certain times of the day regularly a local eggescute nest spawns in the morning and afternoon but at night it turns into onix spawns these mons arent real though theres no rule in the ips lore that says bulbasaur cant come out at a certain time its all arbitrary if niantic says theyre nocturnal then they are is anyone going to nitpick otherwise and most people work during the days anyhow so they wont notice or care
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wasnt that debunked some time ago it might have changed since then but i feel like people here concluded that general spawns dont vary through time of day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a gastly nest a block from my apartment it spawns gastlys every minutes from to and then none during the day i should also note that this is a new nest premigration there was no nest in this location at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a bulbasaur nest near me that that constantly spawns at once and can get up to an hour both day and when the game goes to night though it isnt open late if there are more nocturnal nests it likely has to do with the nest location not the species in the nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was thinking that when i was posting hahaha i have also seen a massive influx of electabuzz and ghost pokemon during the night as well i just cant find any of the electabuzz
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it might be just the specific nest before the recent migration i had a daytime only kabuto nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol that would be for those of you who dont speak in shift lol jk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is evidence that spawners spawn on some sort of long schedule probably the active times just happened to fall at night for a while
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a similar thing happen around am last night i found out that a nonnest had become a kabuto nest and there were at once and then went there today and only found maybe every minutes currently its am and a scan shows only one there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the eggexcute spawn near me changed to onix in the recent migration but i scanned it early one morning since then and it had an eggexcute i wonder if those two are tied
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel it was not true at first and became true later there hasnt been a study but remember when we were swarmed with rats and bats whered those bars ho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting i didnt notice any nocturnal nests before but i live in the suburbs were they a thing that other people noticed before this last migration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im saving up all my outside until i can use it properly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree with this statement wholeheartedly i was so excited and felt like id have a great motivator to go out into the wide world and catch some pokemon i know the game isnt fully fleshed out but i would have loved to experience it even at this stage for some of that childhood nostalgia of being a trainer in the real world ah well guess ill have to wait for the full release and still keep my fingers crossed for cp training
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really would like to go outside or i really would go outside ftfy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually if anything this makes me want to start playing ingress again so im in better shape once they release go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not how u use the meme
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel about the same recently i dusted off the old pokewalker loaded up yellow forest and managed to get a flying pikachu after a few days its a shame i cant move it from soul silver to a newer game though now i need pokemon go to come out so i can walk around some more in the name of pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me and a friend started playing ingress to be more fit for pokemon and i think its really been worth it we are not as tired after hikes anymore and both our kmhr time and how many km we can cover in a day has increased during the last months like weeks ago we couldnt hike two days in a row because of pains and we didnt get that far now we are on the third day we have covered like km so far and its still in the middle of the day we are mostly active during nights d so we are ready for long pokemon journeys d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im one of those weird people who likes the outside
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have gone so far as warning the familey evening family walks are soon to be a daily event so yes feelings are shared
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got it yesterday and it was meh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,derpy sea lion stands by his first statement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thankyou for the tip d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this the first of the aegis nova anomalies is this weekend plus next weekend therell be first saturday events going on everywhere so may as well get your trekker on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can it just requires at least one game from each gen in between two dss a bunch of hoops to jump through and a solid minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ar is preping us for the zombie apocalypse only the fit will survive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what you mean a closed beta doesnt feel like a full and polished gaming experience say it isnt so s you didnt get the beta invite just to have fun you got the invite to help test features for bugs and improve the product for everyones sake
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then you were the completely wrong person to give it to as someone else already said you didnt get it to just have fun you got it to find bugs and help turn it into a full polished game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,any links or instructions i have two dss and im a professional hoop jumper with too much time on my hands as far as i understood you cant transfer pokemon with hms from hgss to other games
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,something tells me thats not why he got the beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have been beta testing and bug reporting games for over years i know what the deal is with alpha and beta builds my statement was that i dont see the draw to gameplay
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm ya know i totally spaced on that i didnt even think about flying pikachu ya know knowing fly im sorry for the false hopes d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ceo of silph company all we do all day here is research pokemon play fuzzball and mess with stateoftheart web apps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,airline pilot here in the beta in the middle of a trip socal yesterday mountain west today desert tomorrow then back home to socal hoping different areas and biomes actually provide huge diversity time will tell
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would say park ranger forsure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the highest ranking ingress player in town has like a outdoor maintenance job and he is allowed to drive almost everywhere with the company car so he spends evenings after just driving around taking portals and linking it all up o my job as shop manager is okay i have like portals i can reach from work and the gps walks around lots if im in the back of the shop so lets say i can hack like portals during work im hoping most of them will be turned to pokestops cuz then ill have a good farming place and hopefully a gym wich is perfect for the days im supposed to just sit with papers and stuffs d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i work delivery in nj pretty densely populated around here and a ton of ingress portals at least within min walk from my job alone pretty beat i havent been invited yet seeeing as i could test the hell out of the game unfortunately my ingress lv was apparently not high enough but delivery is definitely a good option if youre a younger trainer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my friend plays ingress and her job is water testing she goes all around the city collecting samples from reserves and businesses so shes just about hacked the entire city now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,from a less than innocent perspective a black market pokemon trader say they make biome specific pokemon so restrictive that a black market opens and becomes self sustaining as people are more desperate to buy good cp pokemon that they cant get themselves dont tell me it wouldnt happen rmtreal money trading is a thing in almost every mobile app or mmo with a trading system its perfectly feasible that it might happen to pogo in which case a black market trader would travel the country catching rare and unique pokemon and selling them for enough profit to sustain his traveling and living expenses this right here while frowned upon is the job that every single one of us has dreamed of for the past years to be a real life pokemon trainer on a real life journey to catch pokemon from a more innocent and less frowned upon perspective probably a high end member of any nationwide company who goes on frequent business trips to other areas but still has time to burn on the game in between meetings
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would have to say a travelling businessman that isnt too high in ranks so they dont work hours a week they see a lot and can get the time to go out and explore then for worst id say a salaried manager at a desk job no motion and probably work well over their hours a week all i know is my job isnt the best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i deliver pizzas and i think thats going to be pretty lucrative for pogo even if it is just a mile radius by the end of each shift i will have caught all of that days pokemon in my delivery area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,freelance journalist preferably for a backpacking magazine constantly on the move constantly seeing new and strange places deadlines are your own to control you dont earn a ton of money but you make enough to fuel a light vehicle a cheaperend smartphone data plan and feed yourself life on the go at its finest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably like a fedex delivery guy stops frequently at a bunch of different places long enough to find things and take care of business in his truck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,taxi driver they get all over the city especially to populartouristy areas and they get some downtime while waiting for more passengers uber drivers could probably take this to another level although i dont know if anyone makes that a fulltime job
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,university student bum with a card that works on multiple transit lines
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a job that requires me to travel all over the county so i think i have it pretty goodespecially once i get a power bank
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i drive a bus for a living should be fun on my downtime
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,watch what you say a lot of people may slightly hate you after that comment loli know i do xd edit in a jealous sort of way youre an awesome dude p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all we do all day is research pokemon and play fuzzball my salt levels are still a bit high from the beta rejection please dont add any more salt to it im not sure how much saltier i can become before i have a breakdown lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got any openings it experience with aspirations of programming also experience in advertisement sort of jokingmostly not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cafe supervisor here i hate you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,umm depends on how well clustered ingress portals are in your park if youre yellowstone then yea youll have a ton any other lower key nature reserve is probably going to be very very sparse and difficult
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,with that kind of job and that dense of portals available im confused on how you didnt get very high in ingress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i know what im doing during summer vacation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a black market trader would travel the country catching rare and unique pokemon no they wont they would spoof their location to wherever they want just like those guys selling ingress gear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im a salaried manager at a desk job but i live in nyc so theres lots of things nearby ingress was great especially at lunch and pogo has been good so far too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im with this guy except ya know all the experience and training ya dont have any of that but companies like a blank canvas to mold into there own preference right right lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got to couldnt really get into the game tho dont get me wrong when i thought of how theyd apply those game mechanics to the world of pokemon i couldnt help but try the disappointment is real tho im working an hour shift today and tomorrow could have hit every pokestop and gym in a mile radius
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol right on locations definitely a big bonus all i know is my manager wouldnt be able to play at all hes kind of what i was basing that decision on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fair enough too bad we missed out on the first wave youll probably excel at the game upon release though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it never meant anything it was said off hand and everyone completely blew it out of proportion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i continue to play the game as it was meant to be played my assumption is that the save your candies was something thats either referring to being able to evolve a shiny gyarados or something far enough away that its inconvenient to actually follow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im pretty convinced it was a random comment because obvs saving candies is something you do in pogo he just wanted to look clever and have a joke with the community noone can possibly know if it was a real tip or a throwaway comment just play the game as you want to play it if thats saving your evolves for double xp events do it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my guess wait till half life is released source bill murray
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you cant wait just evolve the mons with items still take more time than normal just save pidgey rattata candies for now thats what i have been doing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill wait more weeks till easter eggs and possibly an eggrelated event but i have no high hopes up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to conclude that save your candies meant that there would be a double xp event that could yield xp in conjunction with a lucky egg is quite the leap of logic and nothing more than hopeful conjecture my understanding is that the equivalent in ingress happens once a year around game anniversary time logically niantic could do it in pogo in july or same time as last year in november then again who knows what they will decide save your candies might have been a hint that there will be a sale on lucky eggs for easterspring extended duration for lucky eggs or something related to an event planned for later in the year the communitys timeline is not the same as niantic so the comment could be referencing something many months from now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tbh no one knows for me i just keep playing as usual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saved for about a week and then felt pretty silly just play the game normally
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably until the true shinny release ao you can evolve thise shinnies right when you catch them beyond that is just and above
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im still hoping we can use candies to change or teach movesets i think it is something reasonable to ask for personally not a fan of doing mass evolution its very boring
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,delaying my pokemon mass evo until easter event either the event is useful for mass evo or its not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same boat here i have pokemon ready to evolve what i will do wait for easter if it is not double exp event then idc i am evolving everything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am thinking that the save your candies was a random thing niantics employee decided to say
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,correct
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok i gotcha well thanks guys for the help
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey friend that video shows the testers username if he hasnt been removed from the field test he will be soon if he doesnt either censor that info and watermarks or remove the video from the channel hope he makes it on this sub we remove watermarked videos or picsvids with usernames present just in case cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh my god i had no idea i shall let him know in the youtube comments sorry for the trouble s
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like the berry idea my idea for that is make it so the nanab berry doubles stardust so that every berry has a relevant use it would also make it harder to choose between razz pinap or nanab no a one time use incubator that doubles candy or shortens distance doesnt make the game better it makes the game easier i like the module idea that increases the amount of items dropped some other modules id like to see are a sort of lure module on steroids that will cost more than a regular lure model but spawn twice as many pokemon as a regular one id also like to see a module that makes that lure a healing point for pokemon has been rumoredtalked about a lot and a few modules that increase the probability of a certain item being dropped for example a module that could increase pokeballs dropped from that specific stop another one could increase berries another one potionsgym items and the other one the rarest one evolution items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bluk berry makes a pokémon significantly less likely to run away if it breaks out of a poké ball wepear berry slows down the capture ring making it easier to land great and excellent throws level ball has a higher catch rate when a wild pokémons level is lower than your buddy pokémons level moon ball has a higher catch rate on fairy dark psychic and ghosttype pokémon as well as a somewhat higher catch rate on normaltypes friend ball same catch rate as a normal poké ball but a pokémon caught in this ball will earn you buddy candy twice as fast lure ball has a higher catch rate on pokémon that you encounter near bodies of water love ball has a higher catch rate on pokémon with the opposite gender as your buddy pokémon fast ball the higher a wild pokémons flee rate the higher a boost this ball will give to its catch rate heavy ball the higher a wild pokémons weight the higher a boost this ball will give to its catch rate typed incense spawns one random pokémon of the corresponding type repel prevents supercommon pokémon from spawning for minutes pidgey rattata zubat magikarp sentret hoothoot and yanma super repel prevents supercommon pokémon from spawning for minutes pidgey rattata caterpie weedle spearow zubat magikarp sentret hoothoot ledyba spinarak and yanma gift module a pokéstop with this module attached will give items for minutes heal module a pokéstop with this module attached will slowly heal your injured pokémon when you are in range hp up increases one pokémons stamina iv by protein increases one pokémons attack iv by iron increases one pokémons defense iv by leaf stone used to evolve gloom weepinbell and exeggcute fire stone used to evolve vulpix growlithe and eevee water stone used to evolve poliwag staryu shellder and eevee thunder stone used to evolve pikachu and eevee moon stone used to evolve nidorina nidorino jigglypuff and clefairy oran berry heals hp sitrus berry heals hp fresh water heals hp soda pop heals hp lemonade heals hp moomoo milk heals hp given from buddy miltank in addition to candy berry juice heals hp given from buddy shuckle in addition to candy rare candy gives a pokémon one free power up without the cost of its family candy or any stardust rarely obtained from buddy shuckle in addition to candy energy powder heals a pokémon by of their max hp but the bitter taste forces them to power down half a level energy root heals a pokémon up to full hp but the bitter taste forces them to power down one full level revival herb revives a fainted pokémon with full hp but the bitter taste forces them to power down one full level sacred ash revives all fainted pokémon with full hp obtained from buddy hooh in addition to candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nanab berry already has a use it slows down pokémons attackjumpmovement rates so theyre easier to target without wasting poké balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the one thing that i feel makes the incubator idea not too much of a way to make the game easier is that you have no idea what is going to hatch depending on what you need there isnt that high of a chance that they will be super beneficial but on the off chance it is it would be a nice boost i was thinking have them drop at stops at a similar rate to evo items i do really like your other module ideas though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,would love to get all these items in but probs not all of the healing items i discard most of those as it is especially the energyrevivals there are so many better options they would be useless also the stones would be a nice addition but it would change so many old evo lines out of nowhere it would be great for eevee but a hassle for a lot of the others i love all of the other ideas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know but its widely unused by the majority of people ive talked to because its just not worth it if it doubled stardust as well i think it would be more relevant in the selection because for me a pokemon either gets a razz nanab or just doesnt get caught
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this single use incubators from stops at a less than rate please niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dump every nanab berry useless so yes that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,step one drive an rwd car ive tried everything to get more gps drift and hatch eggs faster but it all comes down to what device youre using and your location and maybe internet speed i get a significant amount of kms per day due to drift by leaving my tablet on the couchs arm but if i leave it to the right i dont get as much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think you are right i just realized that it works better in my room and in the bathroom not that close
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can do this at work bad gps signal in building coupled with having different wifi networks i can connect to means that locking my screen or minimising the go app deactivates gps for a sec causes my dude to wander around then switching wifi pushes him around more then reconnecting to the normal wifi put him back into the actual gps coordinates that i currently am allows passive hatching of eggs spinning of far stops and with goplus catching of random far pokemon score
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes there have been multiple reports of full evolutions on this sub edit and also
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes my brother saw a charizard on sightings today we have never seen one on sightings before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the question is how much will lucky eggs cost i dont want to drop real money if i dont have to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,level will not take long to reach a day of solid playing several if casual according to the table it was like xp catching a pokemon is catching a new one is double those if youre using an egg even if you only find unique pokemon in your first day thats already xp youre going to hit several pokestops in that time per spin youre going to catch all sorts of doubles on the way each throw bonuses basically given it will be a short wait it will be worth waiting assuming the level info is correct
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a website that shows that and it is a big difference
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my only problem is the six strategy is used so you have candy and stardust for when you encounter higher evolutions which you then power up and not to evolve your weaker pokemon im kinda torn on what to do tbh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the thing is the time it takes to get to someone couldve already taken gyms over and trained them up making it harder to take them back so theyve already accomplished what you set out to do now even if you can take that gym by the time youve done that theyve caught up to u to take that gym back and so on so forth so imo it really depends where you want to invest your time and if youve got it money either way those busting their guts and enjoying themselves doing it will always have the advantage to each their own edit also does anyone know if we will be getting the free coins at the start niantic may have just done that to help progress the field test
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am pretty certain that nobody outside of niantic knows what the coin conversion rate will be or for that matter even if ingame currency will remain coins or items will have the same costs that they did in the beta however niantic has stated that they dont want this to be a paytowin game and that they want lots of people dropping small amounts rather than a few big spenders dropping tons so i expect small purchases will be quite inexpensive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,currently lucky eggs cost pokecoins you can gain pokecoins a day for each pokemon in a gym up to a max of poke coins per day or you can get lucky eggs for or lucky eggs for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its also worth noting that you should take current xp numbers with a gain of salt its very possible that they decreased them for the beta just so people have experience working through the higher levels to encounter third stages and such similar to actual pokemon density maybe changing and i see now that you included the caveat of assuming the info was correct
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess pokestops will be a bit harder but i know a place with like portals near me so i should be good in that department i think
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel as if their either going to nerf the xp you get or make it a higher threshold to the next level they know people are gonna max out quick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i forgot the name tho pokeassistant or sth
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,using type bonuses plus using several pokemon makes it easy to take down gyms even if youre several levels behind its kinda like ingress in that way ownership of structures is volatiletemporary it will be interesting to see if they create better ways to defend gyms im not sure about the coins it wouldnt surprise me if you get a little something to help as part of a tutorial
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hope so that way i can buy a few lucky eggs and incenses on the first day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think i might drop a small amount the first day or two just to get good levels but eventually ill be able to buy a few by myself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats true
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah if you have the time to walk around an area like that for a couple hours youll be fine not only will you get the pokestop xp youll find plenty of pokemon including uniques and youll probably be able to get a good start on hatching some eggs and likely get a couple more uniques there thats pretty much my plan for when full release happens go to one of the ingress farms and hang out for a few hours edit doing this right away will also give you a leg up on gear plus there will likely be several gyms there for you to take early ownership of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah but most of the info on there is only for beta testers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and dont forget itll be even easier to take down gyms with friends i personally hope that defeating gyms will give you coins when the actual game starts and you can get the defender bonus too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they forgot to add we were also given coins daily from the shop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks so much for the tips you made me even more excited for the game and now i have a good strategy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah so i cant get to it thanks anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not a tester but i havent heard anything about that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was a tester edit i guess am a tester but it ends today edit i also dont think that will carry over to the full game probably just giving us coins so we werent buying them in test
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ohhhh ok
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its worldwide theres even an ingress portal in antarctica so there might possibly be a gym there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what about beta how do you get beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youre not already in you cant the beta ends in a few days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also when is it properly released ie i can just sign up and use it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sometime in july
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks guess its time to get the dmg and pokemon red out along with aa batteries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes happened to me a few times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not even just the store everything seems to be a bit slower to load up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,happened to me too one time on ios not android restarted the app and it was fixed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine seems to take a while to load now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been seeing significant lag with loading shop data too it was interesting to see how the shop is loaded and drawn on the screen and the coin collection button works when the rest of the shop hasnt loaded
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,psa for anyone who is trying to collect their defender bonus coins while the shop looks buggy like this tap on the green armor symbol as usual now centered and you will still get your coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea happens abit im still not able to buy coins on my andriod have to sign in on my old iphone and buy coins that way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here im not usually one to moan but this is the first time since the server issues last year where ive actually found the game almost unplayable stops are taking up to a minute to actually deliver items egg distance isnt updating with any kind of even vague reliability gym battles are pointless unless youre taking down a small gym forget trying to prestige when any charge attack will faintnot faintfaintnot faint your pokemon until you switch it out and good luck taking down a big gym without heavy potion use even tapping on a pokemon to catch is giving way too many errors and to cap it all something that is really annoying to someone whos never botted or spoofed or even used iv checkers that log in to your account i got presented with a captcha in the middle of a gym battle seriously niantic wtf please fix this because for the first time in almost a year im actually not looking forward to playing the game if i can even log in of course because thats broken too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the latest versions have had a number of connectivity and loading problems ive experienced the following spawns disappear after stop spin nearby blanks out after stop spin gym battles fail to start spinning ball in ul corner speed warnings when ive been sitting on my couch for a hour general windowtowindow load times increased might be my though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we should expect a fix for this at lightning fast speed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it happens to me on ios a few times now and ive realized it because of extra poor connection from my phone itself it happened to me on lte and when i closed the game switched to wifi and reopened it was good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just had this happen and remembered your post i touched where the coin and number is and pulled down slightly but not enough to close the screen and it loaded the items
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just exit the shop screen an reenter again have to do this several times on one occasion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what version are you guys on im still on and never seen that maybe its a bug in the new version
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just wait itd load after a while
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine also did this yesterday but after i collected my coins it went back to normal and its still working
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nearly every time not that i have any coins but still
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same thing on android it happens every now and then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just wait seconds and then it loads
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen this a lot lately it always fixes itself eventually
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,happened several times to me as well iphone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep same issue here was on a cruise so thought it was the wifi was bit annoyed really as the boat speed is perfect for incense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,happened to me many times over the past months ios user here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive said this on a lot of threads now but downgrade the new version is slower in almost all aspects of the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can confirm it happens to me as well several times over the past few days fortunately cashing in still works and i have plenty of lucky eggs left over still
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,every time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just let it settle takes seconds for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got this today and tried signing outin again to fix it do not do this it couldnt log back in again until i connected to a wifi network
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive had it occasionally it happens mainly on mobile data wifi is ok if it doesnt work on the first try i back out and enter the store again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been getting this it usually loads itself in after a little bit though at least niantic will probably fix this bug pretty quickly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this game doesnt seem to like wifi im still doing some testing id suggest trying to connect to mobile internet for purchasing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have this happen a lot usually its fixed when i wait a bit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,happens sometimes to me too i usually swipe down not enough to close it a couple of times and it seems to work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine fixes by logging out of my account and back in seems to work again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,happened to me days in a row but loaded after about seconds on that screen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here sometimes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this has happened a couple of times but only when using split screen or when swapping apps closing out of the store or restarting the app fixes it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here i just hit the shop button from the incubator screen not the main menu and it works every time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not me but my gf has this issue sometimes it loads up after a while other times it gets stuck like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes ive had this issue constantly since i think the last update sometimes the rest of the shop loads after a few
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah happening for me on android if i go back then open again its usually fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,samesies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yupp takes me forever to log in and loading gym battles made me timeout several times i drove minutes to a gym i was just kicked out of and spent minutes trying to log in the app and get set up to battle the gym i got it to load battle twice and it timed out just ridiculous i gave up and left
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah same here and i get the bug where my avatar walks around but the screen is not following crashes the game after a few menus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,many things seem to work less well i dont know how many times ive had to close and restart in the last day i really regret doing the latest update minor text fixes my a
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same for me as an ios user
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah seems like it just needs to download the store wait a bit after trying it and itll be there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha shiny when i upvoted you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have had all of your problems and the same shop screen problems
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,broken gym meh bad pogo connections meh banning spoofers meh better communication with the community meh broken shop fix asap
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you would think but its been badly broken for over a week now i downgraded to but on i was having this issue of the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well yeah of course their main source of income has highest priority over everything else theyre a business trying to earn money not sure why this is upsetting to some also bugs arent just fixed via the switch of a button somehow it usually takes time and work to find and patch bugs more so when youre trying not to immediately break something else again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its upsetting to some because the game is still very buggy and undeveloped the game has almost been out for a year they still havent fixed the dodging bug thats been in game since launch they already made millions in profit theyre willing to ignore major game play bugs for months but if the shop doesnt immediately display correctly they need a hot fix immediately yes theyre a company they need money but theyve had basically unlimited money on tap since the game launched people payed millions of dollars into this game it does not run like a multimillion dollar game though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its upsetting to some because the game is still very buggy and undeveloped this is mindboggingly exaggerated the game hasnt taken the direction a lot of people want it to and yeah theres some bugs here and there but its not exactly like the game is completely broken or something theyve attempted to fix the dodgebug quite a few times by now and theyve managed to reduce it between different versions its unfortunate they cant seem to pin down whats the actual issue and it resurfaces so often but im certain its not for lack of trying augmented reality realtime fights are hard to implement its no surprise there might be hardtofix bugs what other major gameplay bugs are there because i certainly dont know of anything major outside of the dodging bug and a few bugged gyms here and therewhich they usually fix if you open up a support ticket maybe im just incredibly lucky and also ignorantand i actually mean that but im just not aware of anything major they havent at least attempted to fix would you mind telling me what major bugs are left in the game they havent attempted to fix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,asked my pinmaker to httpimgurcomvjucnol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i want to see tsr logo pins in the colors
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have a pinmaker uuuuh you dont hahaha very cool are you gonna sell them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i call shenanigans photoshopped
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was like that too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,uh yeah only real one is the red one thats why i said my pinmaker will have them ready
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sure the molds all have identical scratchmarks in them and the paint uniformly orangepeels
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think that makes all of us they do look pretty cool though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill use what i want to use thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive never not taken down a gym because it had a snorlaxvaporeon in it instead of a rhydongyarados if i want to take down a gym im going to take it down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the issue is multiaccount players breaking the tos not gyaradosrhydon when a gym is just taken dropping in preferably gyarados or rhydon as a second choice is one of the fastest and easiest legit ways to level a gym and still have a spot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah thats not gonna happen high cp rules the gyms right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you want some cheese with your whine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it sounds like you simply cant compete with all the high cp mons going in gyms today i welcome you to put in your snorlax and lapras for me my dragonite will love hiding behind them for protection
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it really depends on where you live i cant even stay in a dragonitesnorlax dominated level gym for day without someone taking it down so i really dont care what i put into gyms now i just go around on my round of gyms after work each day and put in whatever pokémon i dont use for taking down gyms then move on have to do that every day if i want coins might be lucky to have still up the next morning but its gone before i can collect my bonus again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah lets support gym stagnation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but i want my pokémon higher up on the gym totem pole that requires high cp my gyarados has the highest cp out of all my pokémon so it will give me a higher standing in the gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol this guys just whining coz he cant get through the gym of his own colour rhydon dominates gyms because hes a hard hitter and high hp yh fine weak against water but vaporeon is pansy against holstein aswell no matter the cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im mystic too so its people with accounts putting gyarados and rhydon in gyms and not that they are easier high cp mons now account dragonite lapras and snorlax um ok i only have account and i dont have a lapras lol sounds more like cp creepattrition sure some are probably multi accounters some arent waste of time suuure nothing in a gym is really hard to take out be glad the gym stayed months and move on ill put whatever i want in a gym thankyouverymuch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,multi accounters are the reason i put gyrados and rhydon in gyms if i put anything under i risk getting kicked out by my own team im more likely to get booted by multi accounters than an opposing team so i defend against that first multi accounters are making gyms weak not everyone else trying to defend against these cheaters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a level instinct player often fighting against level players in west london with only gyarados and rhyhorn with high cp i think im gonna have to stick to them for now xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would rather the gym had snorlax and lapras in it then i get to use my alakazams too instead of just my vape and jolt hopefully it has an exegg too then i can bring out my charizard there is a very small band of player levelprogress where you arent dissuaded by mon but are dissuaded by snorlaxlapras a snorlax is only seconds of battle time more difficult than a rhydon hoo boy better not attack thats too hard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,of all the things that could be done to improve this game hint nonrandom movesets tweaking the cpgym system isnt one of them theyve already shown through rebalancing that this can be managed in a fair way it gives trainers who want to defend gyms a clear strategy that is mostly not luck obtain highiv versions of highcp pokemon and invest in them i dont understand the complaints about weak pokémon in gyms a highcp rhydon or gary is just as tough as a muchlower cp poli slowbro or exeggutor they are all very beatable and that is fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first dragonite is probably the easiest defender to take down because of bad weakness to type with gyrados a close second rhydon is a bit tankier than these but people are going to continue using those to get top seat in a gym unless niantic changes the meta that focuses on cp this really has nothing to do with second accounts which is cheating the issue i have with this post as others mentioned above is op seems fine with second accounts which is a violation of tos ie blatant cheating instead of asking second account players to stop stacking gyrados you should really implore them to stop cheating if you cheat to steal ten cents in a gym from another teammate thats the pettiest of petty theft and you should be pretty embarrassed i would rather my team had fewer gyms than win by having teammates cheating this way i hope niantic finds a way to catch and ban all these people because its just embarrassing to share a gym with someone who feels the need to cheat at a game that year olds can play
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree with this but if there are multiple gyms available i will definitely skip the one stacked with snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep i find it disturbing that op casually mentions using second accounts as if it were something normal and instead talks about what pokemon they place as being the problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds more like cp creepattrition it is but multiaccounters speed up the process they take out the bottom to place something closer to the top regular cp creep is a lot slower but op doesnt seem to have a problem with multiaccounters per se just with their choice of defenders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if im in a time crunch i usually just skip gyms and only go for pokestopsmon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah you are rigth second accounts are the main issue but if those guys placed their snorlax or vaporeon into the gym probably no one would attack it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its literally a copy and paste with grassrock types instead of water i hope they dont do it like this and do something thats not repetetive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think they would increase larvitar spawns its a pseudo and they havent done it with dratini
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,green event is possible but i dont think it will come and if it comes there will be no larvitar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why not earth day april why wait so long
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,worst post ever did not make a double joke with go green
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,greentype pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not bad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what the hell is world environment day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,text is just an idea they might change it to something else but you got the idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know maybe because there is easter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we already know about this event i was think about whats next
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hahaha do it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know ask vegan people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well chikorita and totodile are pretty common where i live so
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in that case it might be a nice thing but id rather them add comprehensive functionality as opposed to events like this gym rework needs to come before another event imo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill just live my life never knowing its not worth starting a conversation with those people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why not both events are easy enough to do and give us something to play with while functionality is being worked on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not a vegan but whats wrong with a day for environmental awareness
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its ridiculous the days that are out there now if you dont get work off it is a hallmark holiday and now theres things like this that arent even hallmark holidays everyone wants to celebrate everything plus going back to environmental awareness that is just a lame topic all together
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know right i dont know who create these days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,businesses trying to justify the sale that happens every week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,better than rock throw on offense worse on defense still worse than water gun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how bad is it on defense is it worth even powering up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its most likely to be pidgeycommons regularly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i highly doubt what you saw was a nest have you ever seen three weedles or three pidgeys at once this is the same thing cubones are in the rotation with those spawns during the halloween event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,took down a a few hours ago first time on effects are less flashy confusion doesnt do the distortion bit anymore fighting seemed more responsive and in general the game feels smoother everything seems toned down but in a good way we know they tweaked the shadows and lightning snorlax feet and gym lights and some of these changes including ram opt might be contributing to longer battery life i cant confirm it though wasnt paying that much attention
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually is red blue and green red gets bulbasaur blue gets charmander and green gets squirtle yellow is another kid that after red goes missing goes on an adventure with reds pikachu to find red to answer the question i would like to have lore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,option b imo we make our own story edit changed my mind option a thanks for your opinions even with lore we still make our own story
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,slow down fact atm is niantic didnt take any kind of lore into consideration no lore no stories no quests they simply picked these based on the first us versions of the games sadly the only drive to be seen is taking over gyms as many similarities as there are to ingress we pretty much know for sure that there is no kind of lorestory beyond gyms there will be no competitive aspect to pokemon go no direct battles or rankings of any kind they said they wanted this game to be more about collecting pokemon with your friends than anything else so gyms seem to be thrown in just because in some way shape or form battling is a core element of pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,option a
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic has subtly hinted that the current team screens are just placeholders so i mean i think that means that they plan to add at least a little lore unless they just intend to improve it graphically
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well its red blue and green red being our protag blue being the rival and green was always doing things for her own benefit later in the manga red goes missing and theres a character by the name of amarillo which means yellow so yellow was a separate character meant to go looking for red in the story after he goes missing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in the manga theres red blue and green red being our protag blue being the rival and green did whatever she wanted to benefit herself she says she got kidnapped by hooh when she was young so shes trying to find it later in the story red goes missing and a character named amarillo of the viridian forest yellow is introduced to go find red
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent read the manga but i hope this game has a great lore of course
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,with option a you can always ignore the story and create your own but with option b you dont have other choice than to create your own p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,considering how much is not released rest of the pokemon trading ect i wouldnt be surpised if there was lore but whats there is bare and much like ingress will be based more on time moving on and sort of influenced on teams and their total prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the last post on the pokémon website that mentioned all the features we already knew about before mentioned the existence of teams but went out of its way to not mention the team names wouldnt be surprising if its just a beta thing that can change for the release
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,highly likely itll be just graphical improvements if not team name changes but doubtful to be lore as by now there would need to be some sort of test for whatever to make sure it worked as intended although since that wouldnt take much its possible we could see that happen monday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,´d d well i read that as armadillo and am laughing longer than i should now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well with option b you still have a choice the choice to make your own or have none
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would be very surprised with how much theyve emphasized the fact they want this to be about exploring and collecting the pokemon it would make no sense to throw lore into the mix theyve said they plan to add pokemon beyond gen and trading but they havent mentioned anything about a storylore it seems more than likely they want the story of pokemon go to be yours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,caballero armadillo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you bring up good points i just have a hard time seeing any game released without some kind of something narrative brief mention of the teams beyond just pick one or just something i wouldnt expect a team rocket plot or even a filled pokedex plot but just a little bit of creative influence they did highlight taking pictures of wild pokemon as though that were a main function we were all looking forward to so maybe and hopefully it will be more collection based and less dependent on lore that means more resources dedicated to mechanics and interacting with your own pokemon with any luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyve emphasized exploring with ingress and theres still enough lore for people to be seriously attached to their teams havent mentioned anything about a storylore yeah but i also havent found an interview where anyone asked them about it so its not ruled out yet it seems more than likely they want the story of pokemon go to be yours true from my understanding ingress started with minimal lore and the lore was updated as certain teams had major accomplishments in the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah they have really been putting strong emphasis on the collecting pokemon even going so far as to say x pokemon hasnt been caught by anyone yet and y pokemon was the most caught in field tests etc not to mention as you said the pushing of the picture taking feature wondering if they made that so you can selfie with pokemon just usually by this point being so close to end of the field tests and closing in on the launch well lets just say nintendo have a habit of leaking story information and such even if niantic didnt but weve seen nothing like that from them i really do think they expect this to be collectionnovelty driven not narrative based
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just unlucky man havent got one myself even though i caught a lot of pokémon during this event hopefully we will someday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i found my first one pushing my kids in a stroller around a big loop in our subdivision just a lonesome ol pidgey hanging on the street corner then i ran home using a jogging stroller thankfully and made my wife go out and findcatch it too actually my other two ditto were solo spawns in subdivisions as well just catch all the pidgey and rattata you can find best of luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how many pidgey rattata zubat and magikarp total do you catch per day on average that matters more than just how many days youre playing if you play every day but dont try to catch anything but eevee and pikachu youre not unlucky youre skipping over pokemon that could be ditto if youre playing every day and youve caught per day and after pidgeys and rattatas in one week none have been a ditto id say thats statistically unlikely yes youre unlucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre just unlucky but dont worry its not like youre out there trying to catch a lapras or a chansey as long as pokeball stock is not a huge issue i would just keep catching all the random stuff you see and eventually one will be ditto i hadnt found one until yesterday then i found three in the span of minutes one tip i read that was true for all three finds was that it existed in a cluster spawn of the same type so i found three pidgeys twice and three rattatas and ditto was one of them each time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sucks man i caught my first in a ruralsuburban area no particular trick to it just keep going for those pidgeyrattatamagikarpzubat and youll get one eventually
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same the new speedlock on pokestops hasnt given me enough pokeballs to catch every trash pokemon on my bus ride to school
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok three of my dittos were caught at my house solo spawnrural area the fourth one was last night while i was eating at a restaurant the thing i noticed about all of them was that they were particularly feisty and kept jumping and i caught all after i had been camped out in one area for anywhere from hours my method is to try a great ball and if they break out use a razz and ultra if they break out of that then you know you have a ditto and keep throwing ultras i havent confirmed it yet but i believe the ring around the ditto mons with the ultra ball on hand was still yellow and not green so i think that may be the secret giveaway just dont have enough data to confirm my suspicions so i say stay put for a while and try greats and ultras on jumpy mons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are you catching every single trash pokemon you stumble upon caught dittos myself of them right in my neighbourhood where almost exclusively trash pokemon spawn so i guess suburbia actually has an advantage in this instance and not the other way around but it could be purely anecdotal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive only been catching in suburban areas and i caught my sixth ditto today just bad luck sorry to say
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still havent gotten one either then again it has been harder to find pidgeys and rats around here for some reason i still think any pidgeys that ran where dittos ill keep trying to get one with out having to waste my ultra balls on commons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got lucky day two havent seen another yet just luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how many pokemon have you caught i got ditto by catching around pokemon of all types and i guess the probabilities must be higher if you focus solely on pidgeyrattatamagikarpzubat youve probably been unlucky but focusing on those should eventually net you one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty much unlucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have not caught one either and i have been very actively catching
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was about to give up on this silly thing then found my first ditto on the edge of a park about minutes ago on my drive home i saw someone else had said they found several at the edges of parks very glad i gave it a shot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,keep at it ive caught nine but its been a combined hours of playtime since it was released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive gotten on the same street in my neighborhood different spawns on that street almost a week apart and on the main road in the city i work in different city than the one i live in so countysuburb vs main road wasnt a factor for me i got them on the and the last one i was out just testing new phone id activated and i was low on pokeballs avoiding catching higher cp pokemon was looking for low cp pokemon to test catching on the new phone one sub cp rat turned out to be a ditto
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just luck im level with in the dex i thought ditto would take me a while to unlock and it did the whole thanksgiving event went by and nothing that is until yesterday i caught dittos in the span of mins in random single spawn locations both from pidgeys today i got my third at another single spawn point by my house from a rattata took a while but got it in the dex goodluck man
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent got one yet but i dont have many pidgeys around no rattata no magikarp but a few digletts and occasionally a zubat if dittos were common from nidorans i would have by now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no ditto here either i catch every pidgeyweedlezubat i see but i dont actually see a lot ive caught more eevee than pidgey and mankey is a close
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i went to a park twice spent about hours each day there catching everything in sight and did not get a ditto other people i talked to did find one there but i was too late when i got there then went to work on monday turned on the app and saw a pidgey and boom there it was it is just luck keep catching and you will get it eventually
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hello
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes nothing but garbage im using ultra balls on nidorans and weedles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ve read that it only disguises as magikarp zubat rattata pidgey so don waste your ultras on nidoran weedle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,second that no reports of weedle or nidoran make sure you travel around and grab every little rattata pidgey and magikarp and use that great ball and extras soon as they escape to prevent missing another spawn while wasting regular balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have seencaught dittos since the event started i started by catching exclusively trash pokémon as of yesterday i had dittos and i realized that of the i caught were rat and was pidgey so i focused my effort there trying to not let any pidgey weedle or magikarp flee by using greats and ultras on them after i started doing that i have caught more over the last days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh god dammit ive wasted so many i wish id known this when the ditto event started
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,worked for me as a passenger until my mum went over dont know if thats deffo the cut off tho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a thread about this a few days ago i am going to write up my experiences using incense today in a car within the next hour
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the sighting report feature of the silph road gathers a lot of realtime data like weather conditions etc that we are unable to reliably gather historical data for so for now our sightings should be kept to those within an hour or so of when theyve occurred we may in the future have a way to record sighting information that does not gather additional metadata but we are studying spawn mechanics gathering about points of data from the dataset compiled by these sighting reports
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,preview looks again ugly but the uploaded files are way better now with the new logo of thesilphroad the s is here fatter aditionally they are small enough to use it pe as profile picture on discord
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,love it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,go belgium or is that germany
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is there a dutch one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cant wait for the union jack mate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blackredyellow is germany blackyellowred is belgium p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its already done i will post it in the next update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,will be there next update today evening or tomorrow already done netherlands and luxembourg i cant sleep soo d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice cant wait
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they arent sorted by name cp hp weight height stardust received candy received type iv pokedex location of pokestop time received distance to hatch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so its just random has anyone tested unix time received in its couple of variations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent seen that test haha ill summon ulsixecho who would be the expert
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it really cant be any constant because when you go back in the app after a short time they have changed their order if it were some actual sorting method they would stay in a particular position until hatch but they do not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha thanks answered op
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they simply mean the evolution shard mechanic friend wed see it in the apk if it was otherwise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,read the rules
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you sweet summer child
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont want to irritate people who havent got an evo item yet but i really want a and the sunstone evolutions are really weak
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,too late already irritated
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont want to irritate dont share posts bragging about loot so far i have one evo it in spins including a streak
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well ive got upgrades of total items and already used my one porygon consider yourself lucky that sun stones work on more than one species
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,forceclose and reopen the app see if the maximum storage changes and that the coins are definitely gone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this sounds stupid but its happened check you bought the right one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmmm a question about missing space rshittyaskscience
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this basically cannot happen did you force restart the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i didnt have the same issue but last time i never got my coins after i bought about worth fixed it by going into settings and signing out and the logging back in try that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my son did the same thing except it turns out he bought item storage space thinking it was pokemon storage space
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this has fixed shop issues for me as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed make sure you bought a storage upgrade and not a bag upgrade by mistake not that ive done that or anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks ill try it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we keep things courteous and friendly here on the road internet snark is not an acceptable form of discourse here please do not disparage other community travelers or well have to show you the door
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have done this bought one more cause i thuoght i made a mistake and then i realized i had bought two of what i didn´t want
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so are you saying if i have a problem with the game and only ninatic can solve it i should post it on here looking for a solution sorry you can accept morons and their stupidity but i wont ban me i dont care
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since alakazam had a high spc attack and speed with low atk he is weak in pogo this is because attack in pogo is a calc of atk and spc atk in regular games with spd not factoring in very heavily
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no even with perfect ivs alakazam is weak in pogo for being a speedster and not having versatile attack stats with the strange blend they did with the stats even weepinbell has better atk than alakazam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont power it up but keep it still just for the hope niantic will change their formulas to include speed more read a suggestion about speeding up the animation the higher the pokemons speed which would be also nice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sadly you should probably have waited until you caught bigger abra to evolve because its absolutely not worth the stardust and candies it would take to get this poor pokemon up into the theyre crippled by the way niantic ignored the speed stat which was about of alakazams strength in the original games hypno is a much better and tankier psychic type in go and exeggcutor is a top tier psychic attacker with bonus resistance to water types i finally evolved one but waited until i could get one that evolved out around without me needing to spend stardust on it and i was woefully disappointed by its performance compared to similar cp hypnos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hopefully well get a pokemon rebalance that improves the situation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you shouldnt have evolved it in the first place there is a certain point where the pokemons level trumps its ivs due to the stardust expense of powering up id say that is around egg hatching level those moves also arent the best alakazam with psycho cut and psychic at cp has uses as a prestiger i tend to evolve the better psychic types at too high a cp for prestiging so alakazam can be pretty useful vs poison and fighting in friendly gyms its like gengar and ninetales for me there are better options but their low cp means that theyre usually right in the training sweet spot and theyre among my favourite pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its pretty weak if you want to use it you can use it but it will never measure up to exeggutor slowbro or even hypno in that order
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hold on to it and save your dustcandies for now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id say just store it somewhere deep itll have a mega eventually if they are decided to be put in at some point so youll have something decent and likely better than a bunch of psychics out there if you have the dustcandy to power it up do so
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bruh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cp wow umyou should transfer it out for the candies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they should seriously add either special or physical move typing and allow pokemon like alakazam and gengar shine as glass canons like in the main series games
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry for my ignorance what did speed do in the games what i am mainly wondering is how can it be used in pogo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe not transfer it psycho cut is a great move so if niantic ever changes the attack and cp formulas he could be very useful but i am curious about what cp the abra or kedabra op evolved would have been to make a cp alakazam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,being a turn based game the ability to strike hard before an opponent meant that glass cannons like alakazam and jolteon were much more powerful than they are in this real time system i guess they could speed up attack animations and times to reflect higher speed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,speed determined who attacked first if i remember correctly turn based combat certain moves would do more damage based on if you attacked first or last others would scale based on your speed difference electroball im sure theres more someone can elaborate i only just got back into the games
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly it depends on the gym gym with high turnover just starting out maybe ill throw in a lvl rhydon to make it easier for someone to prestige on level gym with the lowest cp in the range try to put something with enough cp to be at least the spot from the bottom if i dont have a mon to use i consider this gym a waste of time level gym with lower cp pokemon these are my favorite gyms because it gives me an opportunity to diversify i threw a pinsir in a level gym with lower cp pokemon and hes been there for almost a month currently at the very bottom though really low turnover lvl gym with all high cp pokemon this is what i save my highest cp mons for the gym closest to your house work that you can actually see this is what i save my rarest mons for my kabutops or my nidoqueen for example there is nothing worse than seeing a boring vape or rhydon all the time since you cant help but view the gym constantly throughout the day the level gym you want to take time to prestige a few levels this gym needs the most effiencient pokemon you can throw in there to aid your prestiging efforts the all insert pokemon name here gym self explanatory theres no way im screwing up the snorlax deep gym with a rhydon just so i can get a better gym placement ill throw in whatever snorlax i have left edit more gym situations the for fun gym when i see a low level gym was some interesting mons it is impossible for me not to show off something random too this usually inspires other people to get weird with there gym choices too the level gym with rattata cp chansey lapras f that not dealing with this gym it was doomed before it had a chansey the level gym you just took over this is your opportunity to get creative do you want to send a message level one ponyta because its my little pony now show off this has to be your maxed out whatever because this has the best chance of not being one upd do you like ninjas leave it grey or throw in a santa raichu with brick break tldr what i throw in gyms is not always a matter of throwing in my highest cp mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id put the most annoying mons like cp exeggutor or slowbro or bubble poliwrath
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent had my rhydon for months because i beat a gym in november and its too cold for anyone to hike out to it and take it down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,level team instinct in a mysticvalor dominated area like most of the world it sounds like ive recently managed to get to gyms that stay stable for a few daysweeks at time for those i keep vaporeons and snorlaxes all north of cp in the gyms in an attempt to help them stay stable some of those i can walk by on a reasonably frequent basis so ill train up a new slot if they dip for the rest eg for my morning gym run before i collect my coins i usually start by placing my strongest remaining defenders often another vaporeon sometimes snorlax and then move down into some of the more interesting stuff muk charizard poliwrath nothing that interesting per se just not vaporeonsnorlaxrhydondragonite all of these are north of cp though just in case someone else from my team happens by and wants to prestige i save my high cp dragonite dbhb for attacking but plan to eventually power up my swhb dragonite to max to have a gym topping monster but thats a matter of candies at the moment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im fortunate enough to be mystic and love in an area with about stable enough mystic gyms the answer for this scenario is highest cp unfortunately this is usually the case because if someone wants to take one of the gyms down then they are going to take that gym down no matter what typically most people now have the revivespotions to do so the only thing they may not have is time by using the highest cp mon you can ideally aiming for that top spotkingqueengym leader this protects you when someone with just minutes on their hands decides to knock a level gym down or levels in my area it gets built back up to pretty quickly and you regain that protection
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i collect on about gyms a day on average but i live in a town of so honestly i could put a grimer in a gym and it would stick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my area there are many mystic gyms that have been level for months im valor they all seem to go for highest cp because most of them start around for the lowest pokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonites cp is all i care about im selfish and i like hiding behind other peoples snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vaporeons lots and lots of vaporeons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am in the midwest also and it is similar to your experience the gym turnover is very high i used to try and put my strongest pokemon in ie dragonite rhydon snorlax etc but even those get kicked out often enough to very rarely get the defender bonus recently i have resorted to putting more interesting pokemon in that do not normally get put in gyms most recent have been kabutops charizard and cloyster interesting enough i have received the defender bonus from those guys maybe people were tired of seeing the same pokemon in gyms all of the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hitmonlee or togetic or lickitungtangela
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if a gym already has several of a certain type i put something different my wife and i took down a level gym today that had vaporeon rhydon rhydon dragonite vaporeon gyarados gyarados it took just a few minutes i was able to not use revives my attacking team snorlax jolteon jolteon jolteon magneton magneton
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well for the last week or so most of my maxed out pokemon a couple of dragonite three gyarados one vaporeon one rhydon and another low level dragonite have all been in level gyms so for the last week ive only had to claim two gyms to get my daily quota of coins i sometimes put my charizard in there or my maxed exeggutor since its so annoying or my lapras cp and sometimes my bubble poliwrath which is currently maxed at cp however other times i just put some random pokemon like some pokemon in the range like cloyster or something unique like venusaur or blastoise which is rarely seen in gyms but in stable high level gyms i put my highest cp highest iv maxed out pokemon like the first i had mentioned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i try to make it random but sometimes i kinda feel rushed into putting a mon in fear of waiting to long from the timer and having someone jump in cuz i wasnt quick enoughand cuz of that i may wind up putting in a duplicate monexamplei put in a vaporeon only to check and see that theres a vap before me and one after melol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,level is king until you get to so always start with gyarados rhydon dragonite and when i add i put in more difficult pokémon like snorlax eggs alakazam goldem machamp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it depends if im one of the first in something that will be easy to train against but not necessarily stay at the bottom gyarados rhydon most of the time if your team doesnt come a long next you will lose the gym anyways if im in then ideally snorlax or vape maybe an exeggutor lapras if i had any something to strengthen the gym if it is almost full i would stick a dragonite on top if im out of them a snorlax and if those are gone too probably just another gyra or rhydon something that doesnt put me on the bottom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vaporeons due to the high cp tankiness factor ive got six maxed out right now including one wghp between and cp gyarados due to the high cp ive got two maxed out in the snorlax because hes a tank here of course i have a hard time keeping up with maxing out because of the rarity of snorlax candies i caught one wild at cp thats been in a gym for a month and the other high one i have cp keeps getting bounced out of high turnover gyms exeggutor because hes got fewer weaknesses a bummer that he got nerfed a bit but still useful for sure ive got two maxed between and cp i dont like that these are the four mons i rely on primarily as defenders but its the best use of the resources i have available and the best way to retain higher gym positions ill probably try getting a third snorlax to and maybe start working up another specialty defender slowbro w wgib poliwrath with bhp to sit in a middle of the road gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im in about gyms at the moment a different team dominates my local area so most of my gyms are mins away the stable gyms are generally level ones i come across when passing through other areas to get to workstores so the gyms i put my guys in are generally already higher level and sometimes in areas i am not familiar with and cannot monitor if the gym is not known for a fast turnover i do not put my best defenders in since i dont want them stuck in some out of the way gym for months instead ill put in something that is high enough cp to be in the upper half of the lineup but does not require resourcesstardust to build up this is generally a vaporeon rhdyon or gyrados that i caught at level in the wild and evolved to a high starting cp i also may put in a cp snorlax that i dont plan to power up any higher the choice of these options depends on the lineup i favor lineups that make the attacker switch out between matches andor make the gym look more threatening for more local gyms that i believe to have a fast turnover ill put my better defenders in such as my higher cp snorlaxes ill save my favorite and best defenders for the gyms i can see from my house which are all very high turnover this includes things like my one and only lapras if i happen to be short on potions it seems i always have the opposite problem now and am short on balls with an abundance of potions then i favor lower hp choices particularly ones that have a cp with hp so i can heal them with revive super potion this includes some really bad defenders like flareons if i see a unique gym with themed defenders such as all rares all snorlaxes all rhydons ill follow suit and continue the theme ill also sometimes put in unique and uncommon defenders in a local high turnover gym just to be make things more interesting since i am in well over gyms and have an abundance of potions it is also common for me to take over a local gym just to blow through some potions and free up storage space for balls when freeing up storage space ill often leave the gym empty after taking it down not putting any mon in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if the gym is low lvl and needs to be prestiged i put in a rhydon if its over lvl i put in zhbs snorlax isib lapras or csb exeggutor i dont have a good moveset slowbro but if i did itd be a good option as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i put in my trash usually cp and then transfer when they get kicked this works well to collect my local gyms and saves potions but your mileage might vary depending on your local scene about miles away are more gyms these can sometimes be stable and since i have to drive to them i dont go daily i usually put my best defenders in them sometimes they last a day sometimes weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can easily lose a pokémon to a gym for ever so i have assembled a large army of vaporieons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i put my best defenders in legit gyms and baby pokémon in the gyms i take from known cheaters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my record is so im not exactly the best at this situation but i usally have in stable gyms at the start of the game i put poliwraths slwobro eggmen and other nice defenders and with their cp they could hold positions well these days cp creep is crazy in my area and multi accounters seem to be everywhere to get a spot in a stable gym that you wont get kicked form in a few min you need to aim for around which means these days my defenders are dragonite snorlax rhydon garydos sometimes ill drop a vapeeggman if im low on defenders or im not sure the gym will stay too long edit we do have a few fun gyms or ones that will turn over in a few min ive added random rares for laughs porygon farfetched when i was traveling and we even built an onix gym at one place or sometimes i add my bubble strat defender if ive taken the gym down or if i think it will serve a purpose to bubble it up lasting or jut entertaining me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it really depends and im not going to give this the amount of time necessary to adequately explain the strategy but here are a few quick things i do solid gym in my territory aka very little turnoever high enough cp to be in the top half medium gym in my territory some turnover but mostly my team owns it somethings strategic based on what is currently at the gym either to make prestiging easier or to make attacking harder depending on the current lineup for example snorlaxlaprasexeggutor may go in these gyms gym not in my territory after i take it down moodbased sometimes a troll mon pidgey karp etc to save on potions and make a statement sometimes ill put in a trophy mon if i feel like my team might be trying to take over this gym i might put in something easy to prestige against like a dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,never gyarados or rhydon they are too easy to beat either snorlax exeggutor lapras every now and again dragonitevape with aqua tail or water pulse all these pokemon have high cp which will put you near the top and can also be a pain to beat but every time i personally see a big snorlax near the top i think eff that i cant be bothered with how long itll take
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on april fools day everyone should only put magikarps in gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my two kids and i put families in think nidoran nidorino nidoking sometimes nidoran nidoqueen nidoking yesterday we took down a level gym and put in a gastly haunter gengar we make it a point to put them in order from low evolve to high based on cp we get a kick out of it easily knowing itll be down in the next hour or so
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if i find a level ten gym and i dont have any mons that will put me above the bottom ill stick my chansey in as gatekeeper especially satisfying if a teammate comes along and try to boot me out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fairly low level slowpoke has survived im a gym for many months so i get at least coins a day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,almost all the gyms around me are stable always a always the same teams mystic this side valor that side and instinct just around the corner hardly changes i have to put my highest cp pokemons otherwise i get bumped off and replaced been catching every rhydon i see i have about i dont have snorlax candies or dratini candies to power up so i only have my army of rhydons and one gyrados hoping i hatch either a dratini or a snorlax so i can power up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im scrolling through comments not many people mentioned lapras is it really the rarest of them all btw i need three more pokemon to complete regional gen dex one of them is of course lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vaporeon or exeggutor i have full power vapes so plenty to spare i have some snorlaxes too but they are weak so i havent powered them up yet due to dust constraints
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,team valor reporting in for me i have a daily routine of taking two closelyplaced gyms in the morning after getting off of the bus one is located at a very welltread area and the other is a few hundred feet away normally what i will do is evaluate which gym will require more effort to take and take that down to prestige leave then take the other when i take the first gym i will place my highest available cp pokemon usually vaporeon and walk to the other gym ive prepped and take it then if i still control the other gym i will just put some random lower cp pokemon on it since it will be taken within a few hours anyway i certainly never put my strongest attacker another vaporeon in gyms since losing my offensive ability isnt worth a gym slot for other gyms that i may incidentally take ill put the highest cp pokemon in the gym or at least try not to be the first one to get popped off in case of a halfhearted attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in stable gyms cp is everything that matters dragonite snorlax rhydon gyarados and eevee thats all you ever see in a stable gym regionand the more spoofers discover the gym cluster the more powered up dragonite there are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for high turnover gyms i put in more interesting mons that make it harder to actually beat poliwrath exeggutor omastart slowbro etc of course i try not to make it impossible to prestige as well my coins mostly come from the gyms that are in an area without a lot of traffic those get the high cp rhydonsvaporeonssnorlaxes and gyarados
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,depends on how developed the gym is if the gym is ill train it up a few levels and plop in one of my big snorlax i have two at cp right now and one at if im out of snorlax to assign but want to add strength to the gym ill put one of my vaporeon one has aqua tail one has water pulse if i just took the gym im more likely to put in my dragonite or one of my rhydons makes it easier to train up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in a small town with gyms that i am in constantly simply because they are very close to my house and where i work i was very lucky to pick valor based on my friends recommendation because if i wasnt i probably would have quit this game in frustration a long time ago as it stands its very easy to go around and replace anything ive lost at any given time ive gone out of town and placed my pokes in a couple gyms that never seem to change and now im getting coins a day i understand this is not regular for most people that said my gym makeup is as follows dragonite snorlax vapes exeggutor lapras arcanine flareon exeggutor is the most likely to get kicked out by far but that is because the lower pokes are at gyms that never ever seem to change someone could come in and take the whole thing down at any time but they are in hardtoreach or otherwise deserted places freeways farms rivers edge tops of giant hills i have a few pokes i like to leave in gyms whenever i can like venusaur gengar slowbro poliwrath as i think they are more annoying to fight but the max cp is restrictive and as much as id like to use them in my town its not smart to be at the bottom of a gym as sleepy as my town is the multiaccount spoofers are present and lower pokes get kicked out all the time if you are dead set on getting more coins id recommend traveling to farflung places and searching out abandoned and deserted gyms to enter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i rarely put pokemon in gyms with a high turnover id rather leave them empty than waste a revive in my area about half the gyms are owned by one team they stay with that team for months i focus on putting my pokemon in those type of gyms the biggest threat to gyms is jerks from your own team knocking down prestige with a second account so they can put their own pokemon in the gym the solution is to put in your highest available cp the only time i dont do that is if i can get into the top half of a level gym with a lower cp pokemon in those cases i use a cp sufficient to get me there and save the biggest cp for another gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should join a facebook group for your team i joined and we always let each other know what gyms were going to take as for defender if theres annoying defenders then i try to leave something at the bottom like a flareon i go for for high cp if its a high level gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,usually just try to throw in my highest cp with decent stats usually a snorlax or rhydon only got dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if a gym will turn over quickly i just put in some mid level junk if im putting it in a very stable gym then i have snorlax gyarados exeggutor and vapes i only have dragonites is in a permagym the other is my main attacker and will never go in a gym same with my larpas itll never see gym duty i typically do my mon catching at a water biome so im stacked with gyarados at this time of which are in gyms dont know if ill go for or not the only odd one i have in a gym is a flareon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my highest mon unless the gym is full of that type then the next highest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rhydon snorlax anything i fancy in my eggy muk etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,depends on my mood at the time statistically speaking i most often put in my strongest pokemon but i put something interesting in once in awhile when the mood strikes its faster to just put in the highest cp though and im usually stressed about being quick so i dont get sniped old habits die hard as they say
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont get too deep into gym meta so it depends how long i think itll hold if ive prestiged it myself i always try to put in the mon with a best chance to stay but if im just passing through looking for a quick i like to mix it up and put things i dont usually see recently ive had fun dropping baby pokes into gyms but i also like putting my dewgongs jynx and cloysters that i collected back in nh because i live in tn now where ive yet to see anything of that nature beyond one shellder
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just put whatever i want to put if im doing gyming with my brother we came up with special pokemon combo eg i put nidoqueen he put nidoking i put elekid he put magby i put beedrill he put butterfree then afterwards hit the store and collect coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i put in zen headbutt snorlaxes which ive been boosting have over now and working towards maxing them all out most are trash ivs but i try to get them to at least level anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,highest cp mainly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup all depends i love throwing random in gyms but i save all my high cp for those high levels i want to last so i can collect everyday usually have at least that i stay on consistently sometimes more currently im in high level so i usually collect in the morning if its super early those random level or i drop in something different like my togetic or aerodactyl but if i know i need it to last a little because i may not make it to the next gym before the is taken then i drop a snorlax to give me a little more time if its a gym that i know will be taken fast and im doing it just to do it i always drop something random my favorite is my alakazam so basically it all depends on the situation if you are going for collecting then you almost have to just drop your highest cp so it can last as long as possible ideally id love to actually have diversity if theres a water fire bug psychic normal id love to drop a grass or electric but when it comes down to it lost people just dont look at it like that and im guilty of that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my general area is mostly patrolled by team instinct im on mystic so i had to set out and find another area that was mostly controlled by my team if the gym has room for prestiging ill add any pokemon with high cp that i dont regularly use for attacking gyms if the gym has high turnover ill just add a common pokemon to it and transfer it when it gets knocked out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep my top dragonite dragon breathdragon pulse vaporeon hydro pump flareon fire blast and jolteon thunder out of gyms other than trying to keep a few of my absolute top defenders in particular gyms its next man up occasionally ill select a different pokémon based on the gym population lots of vaporeon—exeggutor lots of rhydon—vaporeon etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my no choice is snorlax followed by dragonites now in the process of building my snorlax who will eventually be
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so im curious what people in more stable gym regions put into gyms do you go for highest cp best defender unusual defender or something that adds diversity to the gym first criterion for me is highest cp thats what will make it stay in as long as possible if its a fresh gym ill put a rhydon or vaporeon so its also easy to train against while still guaranteeing me a high spot later on if im training up a high level gym i put in a snorlax it will make it high enough up in the gym that my teammates will not need to face it while training i save the dragonite for gyms that have creeped so high that everything else is just too small get into the upper half of the gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i go outside my town in search of easier gym to keep many facebook group have posts of someone living outside town that sponsor his own gims being alone to play half a day for a train travel and you have a month long gym better if you go with someone else and put that gym at for replying at the main question it depends on spoofer kick out with another account i go with highest pl pokemons i have dragonite rhydon gyarados on more normal gym i prefer to go with my infamous exeggutor army i work in a high spawn place since beginninganyway i try to always be at least in a halfway position
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlaxes mostly at this point the only reason i add to gyms is to make them stronger if there are spots to be filled i have over gyms and havent dipped below that in at least a week probably a couple weeks i much rather go on gym raids with too many people for everyone to add to gyms and not add at all sometimes ill purposely add to the bottom of a gym to help prevent others from being the spot still a snorlax or chansey i do want to get all my nonattacker mons on gyms eventually though mostly snorlaxes several vapes gyrados and rhydons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,today for the first time i woke up on gyms my current gym holders are snorlax one cp rhydon and vaporeon if its a or higher gym and i hope to keep the gym until the next day i put the lowest defender that can be at least or from the bottom if its a or less i try to be on the top if the two bottom defenders are trainable anything but laprassnorlaxchanseyslowbrohypno otherwise i put a punching ball on the bottom possibly a rhydon or arcanine if the current bottom is high enough or a ditto if the current bottom is low in highturnover gyms or just taken down gyms in rival areas i know the gym will not last until tomorrow so i put a disposable kinglerjynx or a ditto or an evolvable that i can then evolve without reviving
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i look for level gyms highest cp go in to these anything lower i put something thats below my top because it probably going to turn over anyway im in gyms without having to do anything with this strategy but im constantly looking to add long standing gyms ive been in for over a month now goal is to get in consistently without doing daily refresh that seems safe for the coins virtually automatically
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a little bit of everything high cp is pretty key but i also have a cp exeggcute thats been in a local gym for a few days now its a low turnover town you might say blue and yellow gave up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,imo cp is all that matters so i put my highest cp ones into gyms dragonite rhydon vape anything below will get kicked out by multiaccount spoofers rather quickly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonite vaporeon and gyarados in gyms that are level and that i want to last for a long time when ive used up those the first have been sitting in the same gym for weeks now i usually fight more gyms and put móns ranging from to the highest i have left because i know they probably wont last but i wont put trash in case it does
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mostly exeggutors exeggcute being pretty common makes it easy to level up and they have high cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on a gym that when you battle it to level up or take down the game crashes guaranteed coins a day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if im with a group whatever will make the gym more diverse this is my main motivation to level up or grind stardust putting something other than vaporeons in the gym i hate their smug blue faces solo gym is within easy walking distance whatever will get me close to the top dont want to put a gyrados on top of an old gym where a vaporeon will top the gym just as well solo gym required actual effort to walk to round trip something thats hopefully not a vaporeon and will put me at least from the bottom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i always put something different than what is in the gym i never put snorlax dragonite and rarely lapras or vaporeon even though i have high levels of them i know what a pain it is for attackers when theres a highgood moveset chancey alakazam venasaur victreebell vileplume even jolteon and ditto it makes people have to adjust strategy from most gyms they battle my main attacker is vaporeon and i totally have to adjust when i see any of those i like it when theres the typical vaporeonrhydonsnorlaxdragonite stacked gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you we had a beauty of a gym then someone altaccounted to knock out the snorlax on the bottom so he could put his dragonite on top 😭
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah the gym closest to my house once got taken over by a couple from my team who both put beedrills in it i went and added a beedrill much later in the afternoon it was level all filled with beedrills the other teams seemed to be leaving it alone because at least it made them chuckle then some takemyselftooseriously guy came along and stuck his dragonite in and the whole thing came down within the next half hour with all the spoofers botters and shavers now gyms are taken too seriously and i miss the fun we used to have we still get some quirky ones at the highturnover gyms but its mostly the same pokemon over and over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow thats alot of scenarios i can honestly say i agree with your take on the different situations almost to a t gym in site of my house gets taken times a week i love to throw in my weezing or likitung to prestige it up to the rare mon usually sits on top for a few hours before team jumps in i get a kick out of dropping high cp attackers into lvl gyms just to break up the monotony this resulted in in my alakazam being locked into a gym for a few weeks so i think twice before pulling that stunt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like to leave my st brick when i know i cant keep the gym or if the gym keeps going back and forth other than that anything below lapras i mostly do not use
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive got a bip poliwrath that im slowly maxing out that i love putting in gyms i know its a pita especially if someone tries taking it out with a grass attacker i also enjoy throwing my big muk and other fairly rare mons in gyms that i know i wont hold that long anyway because i figure itll give people a chance to try out those niche attackers that dont get used often
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to love putting my bubblewrath in but his cp is so low now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky i wish i had that problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,surprised people havent just spoofed to take it o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same for my snorlax its now days since i last saw him he must be freezing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,check coastal islands near in europe they are full of gym like a busy city center stacked with either dragonite for cp race or trashy pokemon those places are almost only spoofer nests
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just got my twister gyarados back after a couple months i dont even remember where i left it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im in the same situation most days i take down the two gyms at the local mall no matter the level as long as i have the potions and revives occasionally an instinct teammate has already done the heavy lifting so i drop mine in or prestige them up i normally put in my best vaporeon and lapras in case teammates come along to add theirs when i have extra potions ill take down one of those valor or mystic level towers but then i leave my cp lickitung as a taunt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep this method has let me collect on around gyms for a while while it sucks because only cp matters you hold gyms much easier if you are near the top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wonder if part of that is that when people battle the gym the lowest cp mon is kicked out then the gym presumably gets retrained and someone adds a higher cp mon in so it self selects for high cp mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for my gym scene you want to have the highest cp pokemon somewhere in the middle of the gym if you are in bottom rungs of a gym you will get taken out by your own team and they will put their own pokemon in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i might start chucking togetic in gyms just for fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why no watergrass poke for the rhydons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poliwrath wg slowbro isnot useful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man i don t have the star dust for that lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you poor guy wheres your dragonites i guess they dont exist in texas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a couple of awesome slowbros but have stopped powering them since they lost their high cp same with my bubblewrath
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i put in my trash usually cp and then transfer when they get kicked i understand the desire for potion efficiency especially if youre just going to collect right away and not bother trying to hold the gym but just so you know the other players on your team dont like when you do this it weakens the gym and depending on the cp of the trash you put in it makes the gym annoying to train up the worst are in the cp range—just big enough to take up time and a chunk of hp too small to bother going lower cp for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,which eggs do you prefer thats the one thing i have a lot of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they should all have their just for the day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,super cute
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hear that rhydons are rare here and eevee arent that common either so i pretty much rely on my exeggcutor army only one gyra here too and draggies but theyre low ivcp they make good trainers though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to see them in gyms all the time but now hardly ever i also dont have one my one white whale i have all the other gen regional
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am in a facebook group but they really only play in the outer suburbs of my city the local gyms just have too much turnover for anyone to bother i think i occasionally see each team go through and take a bunch of gyms at once but theyre all fallen and hour or so later if i had time id go out and find some more stable gyms but between work and kids i dont really have time to drive an hour out of town
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow thats amazing must be extremely low turnover
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that is pokemon go in a nutshell right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is what has happened to every allsnorlax gym ive seen they slowly morph into alldragonite gyms but they rarely last long enough to complete this metamorphosis
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well at least it was easy to spot the cheater though i got bumped out of a gym exeggcutor in favor of a tauros no joke well at least they likely wont collect off it either i hope the whole gym goes down though the exeggcutor came back with it had been in there so long so i hope someone refreshes the whole thing soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mrpokes has plenty of rydons to take a snorlax gym no one is safe mrpokescom
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,with all the spoofers botters and shavers now gyms are taken too seriously and i miss the fun we used to have this this and more this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah my dragonite and alakazam dont go into gyms any more because i miss them too much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do it because i hope theyll gain a shadow in their dex and this is either annoying them or pleasing them i dont actually mind which
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyms around here get knocked from level to level occasionally and the risk that i get locked out of that gym altogether because i didnt get back in time to replace it is more than im willing to take so the only thing i care about is cp a few extra points in cp can get you several spots higher so its well worth it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its this but also team backstabbers using multiple accounts theyll knock the lowest pokemon out train the gym back up and put in their own
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really just ease of picking the team based on my arrangement of them it was easy my wife was using others to take it down too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,advantages of being a citysuburb player for sure gyms close by plenty of pokestops to keep a full bag and almost always catch everything in sight not that youngstown is a tiny town but i imagine theres a lot more that goes into keeping a full bag consistently
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one pops up once in a blue moon downtown and im hardly ever there dratinis are somewhat accessible but not widespread so i get roughly two a week three today alone though woo but yeah dont fret for me ive already got one nite lv cp dbdp and enough candies to evolve a second just waiting on a iv one that being said back to gym defense i find that they are best used on offense anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i should have added that gyms very rarely go over level where i live and its been a couple of months since ive seen my team have more than one pokemon in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a local large park thats always a supernest with dozens of stops and gyms and lots of population and turnover i used to roam it after work for a couple hours catching the nest pokemon if rare and leaving only those in gyms once and only once i discovered that one of those gyms became a level with my cp machop at the first slot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i took down a level gym the other day and trained it up to ie enough to be level when the slots are filled it was incredibly depressing to watch the first few slots fill up with pokémon from lvl players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the quick attack and the solar beam thats perfect since it doesnt take long to build the solar beam and can take down vapes like that for defending though definitely physic it packs a heck of a punch and comes out of nowhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hear you my heart still bumps harder with every egg i receive only to be disappointed later but funny thing is i love that the game still does this to me even after months of playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lapras is an excellent defender but with the cp changes its often the first to be kicked from a gym because its low on the gym ladder in a city where theres a very active gym game cp is king
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i get you theres an element of luck involved in where you live and team members near you im lucky and have gyms that have been level for a few months near my house i was also in level gyms for a few weeks in a different area but i didnt go there for gyms was running some errands and got lucky with them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty low nowadays used to be a real battle between blue and red not so much now our town stays red
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a gym ive been trying to keep for my team that keeps getting retaken and leveled up like crazy to within a day or at a rest area on the border of a neighboring state i stop by on my way into work to take it but lately ive noticed several at least people have the same name but slightly varied im getting really sick of people cheating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok fine you got hit from me but seriously wtf
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol thats part of why i do it too i actually just hatched another togepi and now i have enough candy to evolve togeticwill complete my regional dex so ill be adding shadows to a few more dexes in the coming days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,more often than not im the lowest level trainer in level gyms i place my pokemon into so i have no choice but to be at the bottom to my surprise though ive had plenty of those pokemon go weeks before getting kicked out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,few areas have alot of stops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah gotcha where i live the gyms turn over less but there are still players who do this and it boggles my mind last week i trained a gym up to level leaving five open slots behind five very strong defenders it could have become a very strong stable gym when i checked back the next morning three of the open slots had been filled with low cp pidgeys this happens almost every time i leave open slots for other players on my team and i wish the players who do it were more aware of how selfish and annoying it is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i still get a thrill with every egg cracking open then the inevitable krabby disappointment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats interesting but they didnt change laprass cp right because of lapras event in japan at the time so by buffing rhydon and others lapras ended up at the bottom of the gym thats too bad because its an amazing defender tbh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i would never leave a low cp in a gym like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is possible that opponents are multi accounting and sabotaging your gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it use to be like that here i think most casuals stopped playing so its gotten better but then just the other day i saw someone put in junk in a gym we left open spots in was at least things like jolteon not a pidgey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also saw that post and have been testing it in the field a fair amount the main problem is that there is always a possibility that you get a gps not found glitch speed glitch or some other glitch that causes the distance not to register even if you did everything right to be more certain of actually getting distance ive had the most success breaking trips into halfmile segments and using around minutes as my elapsed time definitely hatches eggs fast if youre driving short distances like within a city but man is it boring once the weather gets nicer its back to walking for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do this all the time any distance up to a mile or so from my destination minimize while stationary or slowly moving then drive to destination wait and a half minutes from when you minimized open up app and gain the distance covered once the game catches up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its like speeding between pointtopoint cameras but parking for a while before passing the last p i never close the app but ive noticed in more recent updates the last few months it will autoreload itself when being brought back into the foreground anyway probably to prevent this for the record i dont condone exploiting the speed limit in your car or in the app but i have accidentally gained in the order of for my buddyegg on a couple of separate occasions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i learned about this trick last week but thanks to this thread i tried it with sucess but in my experience the longer you wait the more mixed are the results for example waiting longer than minutes almost never work for me even if i stayed under in between the most reliable step for me was this worked almost every time my gf and i drove to a rural field way to test this wait for minutes profit hatched several in a trip and thats cool given the freezing temperatures but when we tried to make longer intervals than it didnt work reliably there must be some ingame mechanic to prevent this from going too far any analysis regarding this op in my linked thread mentioned that android shuts apps in the background after mins this did not happen in my case edge however i am still not very sucessful for anything longer than further than longest sucesfull step was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had this work great for quite some time but havent been able to get it to work in weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can test this pretty definitively but i need a stepbystep guide my commute starts at a train station about miles km from the next train station after that it goes express for minutes id have to keep the phone running in the background for minutes to get the credit the trip is only four or five minutes long but itd be easy for me to arrive ten minutes early to my train because the distance is i can put a egg in an incubator when i get to the platform minutes early switch to my solitaire app play constantly until i get to the first stop and switch over and my egg should hatch right what else should i be doing eg turn off autolock
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youre going to round down to in your math why not make it simpler and just multiply the distance by distance distance with your example km kmh hours hours minutes minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my takeaway from this isyou seriously drive every day for a distance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one concern when traveling is that this implies your screen is on and phone active which when driving alone is a bad idea i guess a workaround would be to change the screen off time to longer than however long you need would still kill battery though also ive noticed on android that leaving the game in the background for too long will result in the app being closed by the os not sure why im on a nexus which is a pretty well specd device cant really think of a setting that would cause this to happen even when the device screen in on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hi travelers ive made a quick web in order to track your distance and speed as described here before you pick the car open the web httpsestevetarragithubiopogospeedcalculator and then wait until speed is about kmh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,by background you mean not visible on the screen but still running
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also use this to help me hatch during driving home or to company the last traffic light is about miles to my company so i lock screen at red light drive to company and keep it locked about to minutes then open pokemon go the distance will be counted regardless how fast i drive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i already report this awhile ago i have tried the background method the pro of this method is the pogo will try to connect to the server as soon as it bring back to the foreground the con is if the pogo is at the background the gps may turn off by the phone once the pogo bring back to the foreground the gps may not updated fast enough to the current location and the old location will sync to the server this will make this update fail distance gain my method is keeping the pogo active in the front and turn off the wifi and the mobile data since the gps is stay on pogo will always updated to the current location once wait enough time at the new location enable the mobile data the con of this method is that the pogo only try to connect to the server every sec in my phone when i am not moving so i may have to wait up to addition sec when the mobile data turn on the only time fail is the pogo cant reconnect to the pogo server after the mobile data restore i found that the longer the wait time the higher chance the pogo cant connect after the mobile data restore i found the sweat point is about wait time will be min sec i always wait addition sec i am doing this almost everyday and most the time it success recent nest migration give me a chikorita and houndour nests close to my work place in my lunch time i travel between the nests i gain almost on the buddyegg distance in hr and min i set up a excel spreadsheet to help me calculate and manage the timedistance below is my setting cell the name of the starting point cell the name of the ending point cell the distance in meter measured by google map cell the formula and format the cell in custom mmss when the weather get warmer i may ride the bike for this trick so that i dont have to wait very long at the end point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can you go into more detail on what putting the game in the background means does that mean locking your phone flipping it up side down so power saver mode is on or minimizing the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when the weather outside is too bad to go out walking i have an indoor route but there is a stretch of hallway that always messes with my gps my character will stand still and then suddenly run full tilt to my present location this triggers the speed warning and i dont get credit for that part of my walk so i tried this trick and had great success before entering the hallway i minimize the app once i get out of that hallway i bring the app back up and immediately get credit for the distance i just walked
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been exploiting this for a long time and never said anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,these are complex calculations for doing on the fly why not just take the total km and divide by meters easier to do without a calculator meters minutes meters so just round up to the nearest minute in this case minutes just to be safe edit also why was there a need for this post just to grow more awareness the method was described in detail before by ufeldor including the calculations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can confirm this ive been using this little glitch since early december i gained around km today just on the way tofrom work and running errands the game updates your egg distance every minutes so i plan my trips in mile sections for example ill open the game at when i get off work send it to the background once its running drive to the bank and open the game just before while waiting to make my deposit once you see the progress bar on your buddy pokemon increase send game to the background and repeat if your phone goes into sleep mode it almost never works ill either change the settings or switch to an app that doesnt let the phone go into sleep mode
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i use the same trick cycling to work and it is quite reliable in my case to minutes for a straight distance of however it is more complicated than the post suggests i think that the speed limit is a higher one than kmh but i have not found the exact limit and there seems to be a time or distance limit around minutes or km i can never get it to work for more than that factors that ruin it include gps not found gps drift you are going to fast and the safetynet check
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can also refer to this one i also received some interesting reports
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and this is how you encourage american people to use metric system
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been using this trick for the whole winter now public transport with many bus stations in a straight line works wonders i usually get up to a day without walking on my iphone i simply lock the screen while im in the app once i unlock the screen i get the distance added i only go for distances as they work very reliable and you dont have to pause very long of course i enjoy walking and playing pokémon go more but its a great way to hatch eggs and get buddy candies while im on my way to work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so i live km from work so if i open and minimise the app before i leave for work in the morning and then check it just before i leave work to go home again i could get some seriously huge rewards has anyone done it for big distances like this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is great info i wish my commute wasnt miles so i could do this daily but ill definitely give it a go when i do errands
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been using this since you first brought it up and youre work is excellent i dont see it as cheating but using the rules in your favor ive been testing it and i am cracking more eggs niantic is getting me to spend more in incubators so i say they leave it alone it does work and your further work on this is outstanding
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this works better on a minute interval and a distance of this trainer lays it out pretty clearly which is where i discovered the technique from edit udracarys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can you add a table of distance increments and their wait times for quick reference
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wondered if it did something like this i was running on the track the other day while i had the game on but my phone got down to battery power not wanting my phone to completely die i just locked the phone until i got to my car where i could plug it in when i did plug it in and unlock it the game updated with the km i had just walked with my phone locked ill be trying it this afternoon when i get off work its slightly more than a km drive from here to my house so ill let the phone sample my location minutes before i leave then leave it locked for an hour
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had been using this trick for a while only gaining about along the driveway into my work with having the app in the background for about after reading this i decided to try our whole driveway just over a mile not sure what it is in km and extended my time to minutes this time i was able to pick up i know a lot of people have reported this process but here is what i do i am on ios for what its worth my process i have my phone set to never lock unless i manually hit the lock button open the app wait seconds to let it log my location and go to the egg screen hit the home button and return to my main app page take not of the time and add minutes to know when i can return to the app do my drive open the app when minutes have elapsed and i am stationary wait seconds to let the app pick up and track my location check to see how much distance was gained im not entirely sure if being on the egg screen has much to do with it ill test this later when i go on my lunch break unless someone comments and tells me other wise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tldr exactly what i posted on that first thread and got downvoted for it p yeah this was very well known myself and several others have explained it here before as i posted there the app doesnt even need to be on background as the calculation is done server side you could close the app and reopen it you could even uninstall the app reinstall it on destination and it will update as long as you reopen within the speed limit on a straight line as op showed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,one thing i havent been able to fully understand with the distance tracking that relates to this is something that i have been taking advantage of lately at my workplace i used to get epic drift it was lovely and then one day it just stopped happening entirely i am certain this is because our wifi apsssids were finally properly logged into googles cache of wifi mapping and since gps in the building is essentially nonexistent i have to rely entirely on wifi positioning which is now quite stagnant however when i go out for my smoke breaks i sit in my truck which is parked on the side of the building when i do this i depair my pogo and change between the pogo app and facebookyoutube whatever about every seconds to a minute every time i minimize the app and go to another for a bit and go back into it i get a quick massive drift all the way down the street and then back to my location like a rubber band occasionally this also puts me over a spawn point down the road which is also nice now if i employ the strategy discussed here with this rubber band i can get massive distance added in a minute smoke break around i just wait a bit after reopening the app and getting that drift ideally until a update comes in but usually seconds is enough i mention this because i do not understand this phenomenon at all i understand why my distance is being recorded as described in the op i dont understand why mimisingreopening the app causes this rubber band every single time it doesnt do this in another area of parking or in the building or in many other locations at all although i do know other locations do this and i know other people experience this from time to time this spot however it is totally recreatable and i dont get why it does this if i dont minimize the app it will stay in the right position indefinitely out there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tried this morning km minutes didnt work at all however in the past i remember getting candies out of nowhere and having eggs hatching faster than expected so hmmm but this morning it really wasnt worth it especially because there are a lot of pokestops at red lights during my commute
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so basically rule of thumb mins per km
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,iphone works perfectly tested upto good way to easily add to my eggs and buddy quickly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so i keep the app in the background the whole time then after enough time has elapsed pull up the app again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i want to know only one thing does this risk a potential ban will it seem like teleporting like the spoofers do
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how long until the game times out and beggins with the loading screen i cant get past min
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have read about this before and people already explained it and how it works i have seen this around a month ago in a comment that explained all the steps and i have since then reproduced it multiple times its like you say you have to close the app but keep your phone turned on meaning dont close it by pressing the button and keep the screen on then you need to know the distance between the two spots you can then calculate the time you would need to go there by a speed under which is the maximum speed the game allows set a timer for the duration than dont open the game before the timer runs out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is there a limit of how long the app has been in the background this seems to work for me for short tube journeys but not long ones
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes this works consistently if you do it right i have been doing this every day for the past month or so however i have only been able to get this to consistently work for distances under further than that sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt and i get no distance at all i do this twice every day once on the way to college and once on the way back i open the game and wait at my bus stop for about minutes your phone has a stopwatch use it then i board the next bus ive memorised the locations that are and from the bus stop in a straight line depending on my stopwatch if its anywhere between minutes i open the game at the mark if its over minutes i open the game at the mark almost never fails
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes this is how i get distance at home when for some strange reason my gps decides to stop running around and instead park me in a point meters away from my home send the app to the background open the settings turn the wifi offon to make sure that after i open the app again my avatar jumps to my home wait a total of minutes a little bit over the limit just to make sure the distance is indeed counted open the app and watch meters being added to your buddy within few seconds
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought i was lucky to only have a km commute i would have to wait over an hour to make use of this method
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you drive cripes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,um ill probably be lambasted for asking this but how is this not cheating youre using an exploit in the game to get credit for walking when not actually walking not quite as bad as people who use scanners but it still sounds like cheating to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was thinking the same like you but i run a few test and doesnt seem to add up that well per example i usually go to work and let my game on background its almost a km away in a straight line but the path i take its almost straight and i get there in less than minutes i open the app asap and it tracks distance i tried to let it sit for like minutes before opening and the result are the same so i tried a longer distance around and let the app in background for hour and didnt count any distance at all i tried it alot and it seems if we have a really huge distance it doesnt matter how much you wait it will not credit you the steps for small distances however it doesnt matter if you wait it will credit you anyway even if its only min at really high speed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely going to use this for rides to school
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get each day taking the dlr to work and then losing signal between bank and chancery lane thats when most gets clocked up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tested it did not work office to home is about km started pogo in office set it to background locked the phone reached home waited for total minutes no distance increase nothing app was not restarted phone was not unlocked in the middle for minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my result today ios iphone se left it in background for minutes negative
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so basically you have to keep the game in the background for as long as it would have taken as if you walked to wherever you go so for example if i drive from my house to my college campus about miles i would have to keep the game in the background for a little over an hour to get the distance counted so then does this mean i have to keep the screen locked or can i just minimize the app and use other apps like youtube reddit netflix until the amount of time has passed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is awesome i just tried it when i went around the corner for coffee and sure enough it worked when i got to the parking lot and launched the game i immediately got my when i left i backgrounded the app and stopped at a pokestop and when i opened the game bam another finished my journey back to the office and got another the silph road community is the best keep up the good work and happy hunting all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thought i would pile on and confirmed it worked for me on a trip after waiting minutes excellent find
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well there goes this strategy in the next update lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have been doing this trick everyday since the initial thread its actually hell easy when you arrive just wait a few minutes and try to imagine if you could job from a to b in the time elapsed if you think so then open app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all well and good but my pogo seems to restart every second time i bring it out of the background
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you drive km to school why
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just tried minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or just divide meters with mmin that is and you get time easier and faster
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tried a bigger distance i have about straight line to work i started the app took it to the backround and reopened it about later no distance was tracked so it maybe seems to just work for shorter distances
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,amazing thank you ive kinda noticed this but never would have the time or smarts to do such an analysis going to try this out tomorrow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait people didnt know this this is the only way ive been getting distance the last few months i usually bike to work stopping on well calculated points on the way to open pogo get the distance and bike on works almost every time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just testing that youll reply to this good work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are way too many comments to search for this below but has anyone figured out what the max km you can get at once doing this method is i have never successfully gotten more than km and ive tried doing this via several variations and waiting much longer if i recall correctly every minute the game adds the distance you accumulated in that minute if it is less than km and it commits it every minutes for a maximum of km every minutes several threads have proved this with a stopwatch walking for exactly minute starting the second the distance updates turning degrees and walking another minute repeat until minutes have passedand then in the app seeing it update to whatever distance between the two points x since the consensus seems to be km as the max in one go im guessing niantic lets you make up a maximum of full cycles with the game in the background before capping you however ive noticed if i leave the game in the background a lot longer than the time required for the km i often dont get anything at all but this could be the app being killed so it might not be that they cap you in this case but instead they just throw it out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting idea but the thing is if im travelling a considerable distance im gonna make sure that pogo is open in case i get some rare spawns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,delete this if niantic fixes it im done since my phone doesnt gps drift
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i think this works better for people like me that are in the suburbs or have shorter commutes ive found that even if you need to get a gps fix you still have a chance of getting the distance anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or you could open google maps and wait for a few seconds till you get a gps fix and then switch to pogo ive been doing that on and off works everytime
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine doesnt even register when i walk not sure what is wrong with me but when my daughter and i do a mile walk around the neighborhood i get about a half kilometer if im lucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i never get it if i keep wifi on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when you say minimize do you mean just tap out of the pogo screen and leave another screen running as in home screen or the brazzers app or something or can i let my phone fall asleep as in screen lock
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when you minimize the game does it still track gps is the location icon in the notification bar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah the autoreload is what happens for me if it goes into the background even for the amount of time it takes for me to send a text it often reloads i have no idea how you might keep it from reloading after being in the background
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if they wanted to prevent this they would have other options for doing so the game probably loses some of its data stored in the ram the moment you exit the app being overwritten by some other app over the time and because the game cant fetch all the data needed from the ram it resets itself if you just exit the app and dont do anything else it takes much longer for the game to reset itself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i prevent the reloading locking the app in memory when you send an app to the background and open another the system checks for free memory if there isnt enough it will unload something and pogo is a great candidate for that my phone a huawei has an easy way of preventing that dunno about others
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it depends on what youre doing while pokemon go is not in focus opened actively if you open another app which needs lots of memory your phone will kick pogo out of your memory and then it will need to reload in more recent updates the last few months it will autoreload itself maybe pogo requires more memory now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its like speeding between pointtopoint cameras but parking for a while before passing the last p huh where are you from edit im an idiot theyre from adelaide do they have cameras there where if you pass two too quickly you get a ticket
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting is exactly my commute and i agree it works pretty much every time unless a gps error or safetynet get in the way if we say minutes work and more than minutes do not work my experience too then my guess is that you can have to miss one distance update but not two
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,like i said in the post i can nail km consistently then i saw a couple posts below you in my inbox that is feasible im on an htc and it closes down pogo after minutes or so
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe youre not leaving the app in the background long enough usually i forget when i close the app or i get impatient and try my luck then i dont get the distance ive also tossed around the idea that maybe theres a different speed limit when the games been sent into the background but i doubt it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe that should work depending on your phone the game might close the app early if you see the niantic logo when you load back its game over but otherwise it should work id love to see how much you get since im kind of looking to find a maximum limit to this trick
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im going to guess that it wont work i can get the app to give distances of roughly km and its not reproducible it doesnt work all the timeit works maybe time in and i dont think ive gotten it to work for distances much more than or it was known in the past i believe that distance is checked every minute but updated every minutes i think there may be some software function that allows one minute checkpoint to be missed but not more than that maybe twosince some people have reported going minutes but im guessing anything over minutes isnt going to work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you might want to try it with the trick mentioned above about getting into the pokemon encounter screen first before putting the app in the background
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the offer to test i do it all the time and the way youre proposing to do it wont work you need keep it under min in the background or the server will log your account out and no distance will be calculated the most distance i can reliably get to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wanted to go through the detail as to what i was dividing by and why i guess if one were rounding down them i could just divide by but if some people dont care and want to use then theyd still want to know the equation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,op never says the distance is a drive its in a straight line between the two points thats not where roads or walk ways are and it completely ignores things like buildings structures private property rivers etc it also completely ignores what type of job op works and what additional material he has to carry to and from it whats the typical commute like in southeast asia the us is a very cardependent country compared to places like europe thats not a joke about laziness either everything from out roadways to city planning were built around cars and our public transit infrastructure is weak
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats if i draw a straight line from my house to school its km roundtrip and its a bit hilly where i live it would take me minutes to walk there in which doing so with a huge backpack at isnt something id want to do times a year
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,americans do everything by car instead of walking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i found a workaround for the app closing in the background if you touch a pokemon to open up the catch screen then push the app into the background it wont close the app in the background my phone is kinda old and sometimes when i switch to a map pogo closes when the map tries to load entering into a pokemon encounter stops this from happening
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i usually put it in my cup holder with the screen facing away from me i noticed just today that my htc closed the app after minutes maybe theres a way to change it on android
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont have to leave the screen on i also have a and i always turn it off after switching out of pogo the distance gets added when i wake the phone up and switch back to it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think thats a feature of the latest android to save battery any app in the background will be suspended if its left for long enough something like that this is all half remembered stuff
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes as opposed to either forceclosing the app or going into your background apps and closing entirely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so i lock screen at red light youre getting this to work with both the game in the background and the phone locked
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does it help to open google maps before reopen pogo for ensuring gps refreshes correctly i can confirm your sweat point for me it also was the fartherst reproducable sucesful attempt wait if i wait longer it sometimes works sometimes not and for more than it never worked for me so far usually i settle for around wait time so it doesnt get too boring in the car when i will start biking things will get better just as you said
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,minimizing the game or when you exit to the home screen without closing the game entirely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,commenting so i can get here quickly for the answer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a hallway what
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive slowly been finding out more and more people do this the longer this post is up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,neat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i need to update that post because the phone locking doesnt change anything when doing longer distances just simply force close the app and start fresh i also havent fully tested exactly how far you can go since i have two natural points in my daily route less than i havent needed to try there is a point where niantic will dump your last location once you start getting past minutes i just havent fully tested the mechanics ive seen people claim but not in a reproducible method
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this fits my experience there seems to be a limit for its probably ingame because the game opens and refreshes just like usualy does not restart but i dont get any distance added if i settle at minutes it works pretty fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is the thread where i learned about this trick was quite surprised to find this kind of quality post in this sub
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish i saw that because i wouldnt have posted this so i dont clutter the subreddit with the same topic the problem is that its a known trick but its given so many different names its hard to search for threads about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mean why convert to imperial when everything is already there in metric p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats really in my opinion the best way to use the trick is by using it in times you normally couldnt play go this helped me tremendously when i went on a pokémon fast so i could clear out all of my eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont think thats going to be possible but if you can keep the game in the background for that long then more power to you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah sucks its not possible to go for that far i admit its situational at best but at least people cant get some use for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here is my list what i use i printed it out and stuck it on the backside of my phone these are calculated with a base so its a bit on the safer side the actual limit is actually you just have to divide your distance through in my list to get your time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i probably wont get the time to until tonight for now its roughly seconds per kilometer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,will be interesting to see from what i have experienced so far it only worked on smaller distances at least reliably the most i have ever gotten was but i havent waited for such a long time until i unlock my phone either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats really weird i must admit dont really have an explanation for it sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre probably idling the game too much for that amount of distance try maybe minutes max
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,basically yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh i forgot its best to keep your phone awakeunlocked i havent been able to test whether this will still work with the device locked or not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes you can find that specific amount of time then open it after that if you leave it running for too long your phone might forceclose it anyway so dont leave it running for too long
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i highly doubt it as it is very normal phone behavior they cant start banning ppl because of that i bet alot of ppl do the following start pokemon catch some mons put down the phone and do some irl stuff walktalkdriveetc pull up your phone and catch some more mons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not really its something they put into the game if they want to address it theyd likely just remove the ability to exploit it in the first place
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you manage to get actual distance if you wait lets say minutes the app doesnt close but i never get any distance if i wait further than minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think thats up to how long your phone decides to keep the game running in the background before killing the process apparently you can extend it on android
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i reliably get distance when staying below mins mins its very mixed but longer than mins it never worked
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after a while think minutes max your phone kills the games process in the background so i think thats our hard limit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive only got it to work for or minutes max
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice you have a system set up for you i wonder if its possible to get a persistent notification that clocks how long a specific app has been in the background
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think it will work but try it please i never was able to get anything counted when i exceed minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what phone you use can you describe exactly what you are doing incl distance and wait time try a shorter distance maybe in my case i also never made to work but on a wait worked fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm are you sure youre giving it enough time usually for me i get impatient and open it too early and dont get my distance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats just raw distance its km round trip through hilly areas walking would take minutes with a heavy backpack all at am
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,doing it for the sake of science
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they showed a biking person in their trailer and using this method is the only way not to look like a old lady when trying to stay under the limit instead you have to make regularly pauses p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not using any external programs nor are you spoofing your location so its fine if niantic wants to fix it theyll change how the game behaves in the background but until then its perfectly fine by me which doesnt say much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kilometers shouldnt need any more than minutes its alright to go over a few minutes but if you leave it for too long the game will just give up tracking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there seems to be a time limit but dont know if gameside or phoneside for me i am not able to get further
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,with minute background on same phone and os was positive i wonder what the max distance time is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gonna try it again tomorrow morning on my way to work maybe add some time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,uhh yes it might take too long you dont have to have the screen locked and yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not my find other guys found it before me im just sharing my breakdown of it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is your phone on battery saver mode or anything like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its km to take the roadssidewalk in a hilly suburban area that i would have to traverse with a heavy backpack at am which would take at least minutes to complete on foot i know i could save some gas but not driving isnt my best option for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me too very similar numbers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually id like to see if it works given the fact that pogo just got updated tonight i know they probably didnt change this but still
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for every person that finds it new another person posts saying they already knew it i just wanted to give a technical breakdown as to why it happens so people can perform this more consistently
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,would you be so kind and tell me your distances and waiting time at each stop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup classes are about to start though thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this pretty much is my experience max distance ive ever got was about and i waited about min seconds i find i dont get any distance if i wait exactly minutes or more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to clarify youre traveling at a speed above kmh but can still have access to spawns and stops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is more or less known and mentioned several month ago nobody has started an deeper analysis yet though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not really a valid reason for deleting useful data sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i spin stops in my neighborhood but stop before i merge into real traffic this is the ideal finishing move before commuting across town
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,statistically driving then waiting could give you if your app would never disconnect in that time not really interested in it just wondered if it could work p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think you can lock the screen be safe and leave the brazzers app open
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no screen locking anything else is fine as long as you dont use up too much ram and kill your pogo app inadvertently i usually leave it on my home screen because of that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the icon on the phone always is on when you pull the game back up it will momentarily show your original location then update you instantly to your current location usually then the distance will update in the next seconds or so with a worse internet connection ive had it take as long as seconds
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think its more a memory issue with your phone the more apps i use the more likely pokemon go is to reload when i bring it back to the foreground it almost never reloads if i dont use any other apps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i think it reloads whenever it runs out of memory which on the iphone is when i use almost any other app and put pg in the background texting or google maps in particular seem the worst whereas if i just go to the settings or home screen i am usually okay i should try this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep average speed cameras are a relatively new addition here if watching top gear has taught me anything theyve been around for a while in the uk though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe its phone dependant ive also read several or more reports but also some guys agree with my experience i have a edge i dont know when my phone shuts down pogo but after mins its definetly open yet but no distance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,see ive thought that but then i waited nearly minutes for maybe im waiting too long but that doesnt seem to be the case because pogo is still running in the background when i reopen it its not like it closed itself and reloaded
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so using your formula i got the straight line distance is from my house to work but that drive takes approx minutes do do i need to wait the extra minutes before i reopen my app or should i be reopening it the moment i get into the office
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i tried it today without the egg going i dont want to spend a blue on it and it didnt work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not the poster youre responding to but i live in one of the asian megacities population million so imagine the population of nyc but with much crappierchaoticpublic transportation traffic is terrible and the citys three train lines dont even have a reliable schedule i barely commute myself being a freelancer but for most people in this city driving is a waste of gas not to mention time i do understand how much bigger us cities are hence the ubiquity centrality of cars to daily life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should try it sometimes i used to walk to and from work each way and its actually a great way to clear your mind and get some fairly passive exercise if you have a good backpack the weight shouldnt matter to much i used to carry laptop lunch and gym gear regularly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what about bike
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the american stereotype
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not everyone has a bus stop around the corner you know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if i could drift jog around a parking lot in just shoes that would be cool but doing it in the snow in a explorer while spinning a pokestop and glaring at you walking in c weather priceless
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,american this is factual mericans are lazy fatasses
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh that explains how i picked up so much distance while running errands yesterday when i first got in the car i tried to catch a ledyba but i was fussing with my seatbelt stereo etc and put the phone down then drove to my first stop and picked up the phone again only then realizing that the mon had broken out of the ball and was still waiting for me to try again to catch it hm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was wondering about this hadnt tried it yet but ive noticed my app tends to restart when i reopen it after having it minimized and thats without even letting the phone lock was using another app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is go to battery in your settings screen then you should have an option in here called battery optimization in this area you want to set pokemongo as not optimized so the os wont close it anymore to save battery
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,switch out move it to background or close it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good to know i tried this a few times but before it had been so thoroughly explained i guess i just didnt wait long enough before switching back to it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,either way can work i just dont want to be distracted by smartphone so i usually lock screen but there is a problem in ios if i lock screen too long pokémon go will also be killed by ios for energy saving even if i reopen it after the same delay the distance wont be counted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is another post talking about the pogo get unloaded by the phone when switch to another app google map is quite heavy so opening the google map may unload the pogo and force restart at this point no one test if the above distance trick still work if the pogo restart for me i will take no risk and keep the pogo active and just turn off the wifi and mobile data
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,km or metres
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it has been mentioned month ago on silph road
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive just always found it too hitormiss to count on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,now that is a list since im traveling the same route every day i have searched and found certain points where i could unlock my phone and get the distance rewarded its quite a daily routine that consists one small extra walk of meters i wouldnt take otherwise d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seconds per seems too fast but if you refer to the per in my list i had a typo its actually per d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i should mention i have a galaxy but it was the same situation on my
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks ill give it a try
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have done it with my phone locked no service temporarily and no other app open mostly because its part of my daily commute but its not effective most of the time ive only reproduced it with any regularity on a short distance and less than minutes elapsed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as it is very normal phone behavior yep its basically the same as entering a reception blackspot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no i aimed to min directly p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont have to check when your phone has been in the background when you start up the game it checks your initial location close the app and start up your stopwatch now as long as you open the game after more than minute itll clock your distance as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will try in the morning i get my daily by pulling into a starbucks parking lot and put the phone on airplane mode at work on the way home i call my wife ill try to figure something out it would give me a
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dit for walking when not actually walking not quite as bad as pe it makes up for the horrible tracking and all the other walking with the app open and i dont get credit its probably not even close to a wash
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i also tried less than in background and open after or hours in one morning when i forgot to open the app when i got to work and still got credit so im pretty sure the game still tracking even if it stays for more than
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,understood but i found it from you so thanks for reposting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no its android and ive got it on the maximum battery wasting mode screen off after minutes etc if i just go and have a look at chrome and come back immediately it will restart about every second or third time but not always sometimes it can go ages it also never quits over night when on the charger
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had my concerns too given the update but tried it today it still works but we need to test the limits ive landed a sucessfull but a step failed but might be due a gps drift
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they didnt i have been doing this for months worked on the drive home i will create a long reply for this topic as i have been tracking this for months and of my friends are insanely good at it one of them has gotten for one set distance constantly traveled at least times a day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it still works on on ios
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure and thats great but your post is written as if this was a fairly new trick which surprised me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure i usually go about m straight the way i walk is about m at a time if im walking i dont wait at all just pick up the phone and check most of the time i get the distance within a few seconds walking that distance takes me about minutes give or take when i do the same track on bike i ride it the same distance get off my bike and walk for about minute then pick up the phone and get the distance the corresponding bike trip takes maybe minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i tested again today i did my usual as the crow flies today with the game in the background but forgot about it and accidentally waited minutes no distance given and the game wasnt killed for memory i successfully resumed from paused stated nsbp as a side question have you noticed whether it makes any if youre already moving too fast when you pause the game in the first place sometimes i pause it when im already going way too fast and when i resume i dont get any distance but this could be anecdotal or something else could have gone wrong
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah or just take the bus and actively play you constantly start and stop which means much of the time you are under also bussing is way better for the environment also you can spin stops and catch pokes on the move and not endanger lives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in theory yes but i doubt it every time i exceeded it never worked i think there is a hidden ingame mechanic that prevents this but i also have read reports of going or more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as dingsign pointed out i think there is a time limit to this i also have not been able to get it to work over mins or so but driving to the grocery store kids dentist or my favorite pokestop works great
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theoretically yes but id imagine there is a hardcap to it and thats determined by how long your phone decides to keep the game in its ram before killing the process
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tried this once but need to wait about hours with the distance between where i work and home i didnt use my phone at all during this time and the app was still connected when i opened it back up it didnt give me any distance so i think there maybe a time limit im just not sure what the longest may be
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i lock my screen and it works most of the time it might depend on the phone mine has of ram so i think it leaves apps open longer in the background
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i lock my screen all the time and it works i have an iphone and i have background for the app on and depending how far it open it up after or mins the most distance ive gotten is around km in a single close reopen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been able to get more than minutes its probably dependent on your phones battery saving policy see if you can find a way to prevent your phone from killing the app an you might be able to go longer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have exactly this problem thats why i keep saying myself its not gonna work longer than minutes when i wait longer than minutes i never gain distance regardless how far or not far i walked the app doesnt restart but i still dont get anything there must be some kind of internal system that prevents exploiting too much i just dont know what it is exactly staying under works fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you would wait the extra four minutes it doesnt matter when you do it so you could also open the app load in and put it i the background a few minutes before you leave
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive tried it and im always sweaty and dead this is what i get for not exercising at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,selfreference about trolling
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,look just because america isnt doing so well right doesnt mean you need to keep poking at us were not here to argue over whether using a vehicle to do testing or accumulate a little distance is right wrong or otherwise and we certainly arent here to take the piss out of one another were here to do research and share findings knock this crap off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i talk about walking not driving by car or bus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can bike too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not really people look for the stereotype they want perpetuated so they see it more often than the countless americans who do work out and are out there beating their feet against the pavement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,til thanks for the tip
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just pressing the home button
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah it happens on my android as well probably some way that can be changed its only a matter of how
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i missed the decimal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its been mentioned many times but explained in this much detail no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats why i made this post since i found thr innerworkings and a makeshift method you might be able to do it more consistently
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i was kind of rushed trying to get to everyone it should be about five minutes so sounds about right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good to know thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so you actually get full distance credit when you wait that long
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting did you have to reopen the app or was it still running in the background
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks will test it further after work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good to know thanks for reporting back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for reporting back glad to hear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not written that way at all he even links the previous threads in his first paragraph and even if so so what sheez
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oddly enough im fairly certain you can still get the normal distance even if you get the moving too fast notification in fact ive been testing it occasionally and have found that so long as your asthecrowflies distance doesnt exceed the maximum amount you can be going too fast on either side ie the notification pops up right before you put the app in the background andor the notification pops up right after you bring the app back into the foreground still testing it but ill come back to reply again whenif i have a conclusion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do this every day i get a remarkable amount of distance from being on the nonexpress bus in heavy traffic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel the last point should have been the first you shouldnt drive and play
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perhaps related but i get a lot of gps freeze on my memory phone and if i do not leave the phone go to power saving the game think i am just very static it did happens a couple of time in proximity of a pokestop when waiting for my train so i did not restart the game to see how many time i could spin the stop while in the train i can get or extra spin but then i get the try again later message so there is a kind of timeout here as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do this all the time and the hard cap seems to be that after about min of the app not communicating with the server the server will log you out my phone can keep the game in its ram for hours but the trick never works past min for me i do get pretty solid reliability at with a timer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fair enough i just had heard previous reports that it needed to be left unlocked now that you say it though i think sometimes after locking my screen the app is still minimised and doesnt have to fully reboot i have so would make sense it would be more inconsistent than yours with i will have to test further
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,must be my phone then i only have of ram
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the thing is in none of the cases the pogo app was killed it was running as always it refreshes my position etc but no distance is added
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my phone can keep pogo in the ram for hours if i open the app after a long time while in an area with a bad data signal the app may tell me it couldnt log me in do i want to try a different account it can send this message without me seeing a loading screen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre missing the fact that that walk could be your exercise a couple of months of that walk and you wont be sweaty and dead at all when you get to work and youll see other health improvements too i used to make a km round trip walk to and from uni and when i moved and stopped walking i noticed the effect on my health pretty soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah sweaty isnt great before work i didnt find it too bad and im in sydney where it regularly gets over in summer but its mostly a dry heat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are always sweaty and dead because you do not walk or you could try biking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i could if work werent twelve miles away when my shifts end at night theres no way im getting back out on the highway on a bicycle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes let me grab my papers put on my suit and ride in the rainheatetc not everyone works fast food
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no because at min pogo closes in my opo without greenify
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still running as usual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think you misunderstood my comment im not criticizing the post in any way i was just surprised that people didnt know about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre right i made sure to check today while i didnt get the youre moving too fast notification at first i was def moving too fast because it wouldnt let me spin stops while at this speed i minimized the app waited exactly mins and seconds and traveled as the crow files then opened the app got youre moving too fast and hatched an egg the egg had more than a left on it the moment i minimized i also screenshotted my buddy bar chansey and it went from about to nsbp so i think the conclusion weve come to is that it doesnt matter if youre moving too fast when you background the app in order to get up to km in min
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not everyday you see a commuter be glad about traffic the life of a pogo commuter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am in no way condoning that as this trick doesnt involve you even having the game open while driving
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,technically he is not playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i run proximity service and it works for me on ram no need to screen lock though it tends to work less frequently than it would with or probably sometimes i open it and pogo is reset usually caused by some app update notification or a textcalletc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep i see plenty of office workers biking around in suit not in the rain though i guess i dont recognize them any more because they put a rain jacket over or maybe they take the car those days what do i know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,now thats impressive if you dont mind sharing whats your phoneosconfiguration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive since tested it out as well and i can give the same validation steps have pogo open get going too fast notification minimize app for about min and sec dont travel more than as the crow flies from where you minimized it open up the app again after the even if youre still going too fast get distance i can confirm that this works for me every time unless i happen to get a gps not found error thats such a bummer whenever it happens now in step i think ive added new information i found that if you wanted to you could be driving too fast minimize app stay still for about min sec start driving again and open up the app while youre moving fast again this means you can be moving too fast on either or both ends of your and youll still get distance your speed doesnt affect how much distance you get so long as you still obey the rules already discovered
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my city streetcars are endgame people actually just hop on one of the two big routes that run through downtown to fill up on items rofl
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fyi i have timed it and gotten distance despite more than minutes passing since minimizing the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i too have noticed i can wait more than minutes but i still cant get more than distance in one go ive waited minutes on accident once and i still got the distance i traveled
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after doing this consistently many many times daily ive never had distance recorded waiting more than minutes also the closer i get to away from where i backgrounded my car gps shows exact distance as the crow flies what counts and doesnt gets pretty inconsistent i pretty much just try for now to be safe as an aside from my couch i can float away background for minutes jump back on wifi and resume and every other time mins total i get the counted when im casually watching tv i hatch eggs like crazy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,legacy moveset yea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow you guys are fast and all agreed that makes my decision easy thanks for the feedback lord helix here with his legacy moveset will be joining my lineup
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,similar conundrum here i just got my first water gun hydro pump iv omastar but this post made me remember my old rock throw hydro pump iv omastar this particular moveset is a little awkward as its not really offensive or defensive and has mismatched types but should i power the legacy one up over the higher iv perfect moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so i have this iv omastar with the legacy moveset rock throwrockslide ive always loved this pokemon and am interested in using it as a gym defender when i looked up optimal movesets gamepress had this moveset listed as most effective however im not thrilled about the what would you guys do keep the suboptimal ivs or roll the dice on another moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait i finally get to humblebrag about one of my pokémon on here my only iv pokémon is a rtrs omastar just maxed him out so happy ok maybe that wasnt humble edit got distracted and forgot to respond to the query fwiw id still do the sameeven if he was seventysomething percent especially with the newly increased max cp for omastar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a iv omastar with rtrs as well its before i knew about movesets and it also was my first omastar so i kept it and now looking back im so glad i kept it it can kill lapras its cp now as omastar was buffed i hopefully will max it out even at
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would power the legacy omastar up without hesitation i wouldnt do it because its the logical reason no sir id do it because hes one of the last of his kind id do it for all the extinct legacy pokemon we will never see the quick attack starmie the dragon breath gyarados id do it for america
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a iv omastar with water gunrock slide the best available nonlegacy moveset for defense but id kill for yours rock throw is so much better as a defensive move than water gun more damage more energy per use and better typing it hits dragonite and lapras super effectively unlike water gun which is resisted by both and also damages grass types omastars biggest counter for neutral damage water gun again is resisted i would be very happy with your omastar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since you cant get this moveset anymore and is really not bad i would max it out no question omastar is one of my personal favorites though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i maxed out my legacy omastar who has around ivs its worth it for that moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would give a lot for that pokemon like at least a dragonite perfect victreebel snorlax and pretty much whatever else you would want all together for that one pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so jelly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a quick attack starmie too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wat if gyarados has db twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rock throw has an eps with stab at only benefit is the damage it does while watergun doing less damage at with stab but gets eps imo watergun is best due to its energy per sec it will load rockslide so quick that it becomes spam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dang didnt realize i was sitting on such a hot commodity all this time lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a gyarados with dbtwister looks cool having double dragon moves even when one is a crap one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,doesnt eps only apply for attacking someone correct me if im wrong but for defending you want to look at epu or energy per use rock throw gives energy per use and water gun gives so for a defender rock throw will generate energy faster for attacking you can use water gun twice per second which is why its eps is but defenders dont attack that quickly due to defender mechanics
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if trading comes out would you be at all willing to trade i dont know why but im obsessed with getting that moveset i love the one i have with wgrock slide its one of my favorites even though its not the best attacker edit also fyi omastar is a pretty good defender but has an unfortunate double weakness to grass which keep him from being near top tier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did u max it out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol where did you get epu dps damagepersec applies to attacking not eps eps applies to both rock throw is energy per second the is the damage rock throw does might want to check out pokemongogamepressgg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for the right pokemon yes but ive nearly completed my dex and this is literally something you can no longer obtain one of the regionals might convince me or depending on how the exclusiveness is set up one of the legendary pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonite is not worth anything make it at least lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent powered it up at all i may in the future but its level from a hatch and it would take a lot to get him maxed im currently hoarding stardust for possible gen release within the next couple of months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,believe it or not i got epu from httpspokemongogamepressggquickmoves every move has a certain amount of energy generated per use rock throws is yes rock throw is energy per second but that assumes youre using it as soon as its off cooldown which only happens when attacking defenders dont do that they only attack at set intervals so epu is more appropriate to look at for defenders the only reason water gun has such high eps is because it does epu and its cooldown is meaning you can use it twice a second when attacking x but defenders do not and cannot use their moves twice a second so eps is moot btw rock throw does not do damage it does
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fair enough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a dragonite with db is a better attacker than most every other pokemon i have two at i would replace the with one of those then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,epu only applies towards special moves you might want to take a look at gamepress again and reevaluate your knowledge base attacks are what it uses to generate energy in order to use the special moves btw he has stab so its not water gun with stab does not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,incorrect you didnt look at the page i linked epu means energy gained per use it applies to basequick attacks the chart clearly states that rock throws epu is youre thinking about energy lost per use which applies to chargespecial moves i also posted httpspokemongogamepressggqaepuvseps about epu in the gamepress qa and the responders refuted what youve said i suggest reading their posts and reevaluating your knowledge youre right about rock throws dps though i wasnt taking stab into account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpspokemongogamepressggpokemonmoverockthrow now you tell me where you see any sign of epu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it just came to my knowledge that they removed that information for some reason i can understand you not believing me but there was definitely a column for epu before it was on httpspokemongogamepressggquickmoves btw not the one you linked if you check the httpspokemongogamepressggqaepuvseps that i posted the responders explain what it is and how its calculated just multiply eps by cd so in the case of rock throw its
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i understand perfectly if you press on more info under each mons specials it clearly shows epu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok just read the post my apologies since it was not stated it led me to believe that a higher energy source would be way more sufficient combod with a low cd well then in that case good catch op
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,est
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nest changing tomorrow btw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just got my invite and caveat im on android but fwiw im level in ingress but have not played in the last months so recent activity at least does not seem to have been a prerequisite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im a somewhat active ingress user and i didnt get in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in the following poll a plurality were not ingress players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ditto here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,almost daily active agent no invite rip me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sadly only lvl
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same just dinged three the other day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its possible to hit in a day if you get with your local players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,may have to try that going solo has been rough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its built to be a team game not to say i didnt spend hours farming keys to maxfield a portal block radius solo and felt pretty good about it but the really big ops and ap grinding is best done with a team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,treat this as unverified information for now friend no other source has made that claim it seems arbitrary and unlike niantic to be honest id wait to see more information before assuming anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,days is the current expiration countdown of the invitation for the app in test flight this renews to days every update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think we would already know about this if that were the case
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would take it with a grain of salt i highly doubt they have the actual timeline we havent found anything so far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems like a really long time to collect data for the current build as polished as it is idk maybe there are a lot more mechanics being worked on that havent been added in yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id like to know where he got that information tbh i hope hes making stuff up this game needs a lot of work still to have any kind of longevity and i dont think they can pull it off in two months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pogo info facebook those three words dont go together
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perfect explanation so this facebook post is just a guy who is proud of himself thinking he stumbled across a backdoor leak to keep tabs on a timeline but actually hes just misinformed and doesnt understand what hes looking at
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can verify this timer in test flight its not an indicator of actual game release
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i very highly doubt it the medals already provide a catch rate bonus of their own so it doesnt make sense to have another one tied to them there also doesnt seem to be a strong reason to go through the trouble of coding that even if it is only a requires a small amount of effort
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think i crit a murkrow before getting my gold dark badge but i have proof of this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope i was lucky enough to critical catch a bayleef and i only have a silver medal for grass types
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,alrighty the theory has been proven incorrect just been trying to help out cheers guys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got a critical capture on my first ever sneasel and i have neither relavent medals dark or ice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got it for the first time a few days after gen ii released while catching a murkrow i didnt even have the bronze metal yet i actually think it is more likely to happen after you register a new pokemon in the pokedex in the original games it was more likely to happen the more complete your pokedex was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i get critical captures of murkrows all the time and i only have the silver medal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the candy difference between powering them up isnt huge id say go for the if the were something like level then id go with the higher level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolve the one with the highest average between cp and iv
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just brace for bad moveset they seem to ruin so many of my high iv mons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,certainly there are better movesets but each dragonite moveset is good for either attacking or defending as long as you can make use of either an attack or a defender the mon should be extremely useful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is very real good thing dnites worst moveset is still useable in some fashion defensively ive got dragonites all evolved from and iv dratini respectively the first two at iv got steel wing hb and then db hb respectively both at and stardust requirement dont know what level those are the last one at got db hb and is at level hatched good luck op
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as long as its not hyperbeam its a great moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a better way of getting this problem solved would be messaging the mods and also doing it in a way that isnt rude and you might want to try and make a more coherent sentence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is coherent if you were to repeat what i wrote to someone it would make complete sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,atals oops error submitting report dafuq
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,u wot seriously tho we should all be a bit more polite the mods and people who run this are volunteers so please be nice when asking for things or reporting bugs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we owe the nest atlas the nest atlas doesnt owe us anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but i wasnt asking im telling them to do their job its what they signed up for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no one signed up to be abused in this way i work in customer service and times if a customer is nice to me ill do what they ask and more if they are horridrude ill do the near minimum youre not entitled to anything in this life and will quickly learn that being rude will not get you very far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ಠಠ
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and the issue still isnt fixed why should i took the time out of my day to contribute and help others and cant so im not going to bother anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you took the time to be rude and considering you used text speak how much time did that save you also im not sure where tsr mods are based but in the uk its currently plus they will have other commitments just like every other person also the error may now be down to tsr as others can add nests ect it could be your internet service firewall or some other variable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,poliwrath with mud shotsubmission works well against lapras too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,steel is also not very effective vs water same effectiveness as fire vs lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,uh what moves do you want for rhydon vs snorlax and what secondary move for kingler is good against lapras i have vice grip
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup this is what i use against lapras too mud shot is super fast animation i can get in shots between each laprass attack submission may not deal a lot of damage but its super effective and charges quickly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rhydon can learn rock smash a fighting type but unlike other fighting type move users rhydon isnt weak to snorlaxs zen headbut
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think its believed at least i believe that a pokestop will drop a pokemon per se so like you spin a stop and it decides to give you a lapras then it determines what egg pool lapras is in and shows that egg whats happening to you and many others may be a biome related thing and this would be worth researching if egg hatches have any correlation to your biome one thing that is known is that what will hatch from an egg is determined at the time the egg is picked up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rng
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,get you a poliwrath with double fighting moves good versus lapras and tyranitar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how does bubblehydro pump do i already use him for low cp flareon arcanine and rhydon to decent success
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dunno i dont have either all my poliwrath have ice charge moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what wasnt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what am i looking at that wasnt there before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes you log in with your googleplaystorewhatever account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all your stuff is saved in the cloud
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok sweeet thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what happens when it rains will anyone be able to pickup my sweet pokeloot s
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,before the update double resistance did not exist damage calculations have changed in the last patch now i have no idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought it was damage in the games so id assume in go correct me if im wrong
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,umactually we have been assuming that double resistances do exist in the way that the op describes damage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im almost positive its multiplied from everything ive read that seems to be the case i havent played since first gen though just did a bunch of reading up to get prepared for go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dislike how you get downvoted despite saying correct me if im wrong come on folks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah damn apologies
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is multiplied i just realized a resistance becomes a resistance when youre strong against an element disregard my previous comment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i was wrong sowhatever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,battery died havenr changed it id make an assumption that the battery may have something to do with it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try here rgoplus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what phone os game version if youre on android get for sure since it fixed a lot of issues have you reset the plus hold until blue let go immediately hold until vibrates does the plus do anything when you press the button if literally nothing happens then the battery is obviously ready to be changed if nothing works try a different battery to make sure its not just the battery
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not the op but i had the same problem android pogo and reset the go worked for me thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the detailed reply it was a human error i was not properly pressing the go plus button when the app was supposed to be looking for it its all working great now thanks again now i just gotta find my spare batteries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill trade you a bunch of pinecones for ive hatched of them already nada for larvitar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill count myself as lucky then i saved up a bunch of incubators from the holiday event thanks to an itunes gift card at christmas ill keep hatching walking my buddy and hoping for the best sorry for the apparent bragpost
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish ive been able to catch a few of them and walking for that precious candy i however have had a lot more dratini hatching luck than larvitar im absolutely willing to part with a high iv dratini for a high iv larvitar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive hatched out of eggs i have hatched gligar pineco and mantine though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,of my one egg hatched larvitar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is all random ive hatched gligars pineco and only one larvitar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are lucky hatched one mareep and mantine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought maybe it was a greater chance the first couple of days since my wife hatched three including a perfect one and i hatched two since the third day neither of us has had another also we were getting unusual numbers of eggs those first few days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since gen i have hatched pineco mantine swoodoodo or however you spell it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no your lucky for gen pokemonm from eggs ive hatched larvitar mareep matime gligar pincones skarmony
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rng probably since gen my hatches have been dratini larvitar pineco not rare in my area gligar useless
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive hatched sudowoodo not rare here and gligar its a bunch of bs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,had eggs since gen launched first was pineco and the last were larvitar i am not complaining
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish that was the case ive had eggs gligar larvitar and a lapras i just picked up eggs today please bless me with your luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or so since gen and none are larvitar ive been lucky with other things so its not a big deal but i wouldnt mind hatching some of those are a mareep or two
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pineco mantine gilgar chansey my first
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since gen ii commenced i have hatched mantine dratini gilgar pineco larvitar really want to hatch a miltank
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a plethora of phanpy for me 😕
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no idea but out of my eggs have been lavitar and dratini which in of itself is odd as those are the only dratini ive hatched since launch edit right forgot about the scarmory so out of eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got out of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gotten eggs in past week no larvitar edit eggs later and ive hatched one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my eggs ive hatched lapras and dratini since gen larvitar but ive caught candies worth using pinap every time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here all pineco
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pineco in a row now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no larvitar but im like a hatch rate on dratini since gen came out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hatched recent and am pretty happy with them larvitar had already from live catches i was walking mine so the egg hatches helped with candy and ivs dratini iv which im thrilled about since at almost level i still have no dragonaire or dragonite and highest iv before this was and mantine which i didnt even know existed until it hatched id be happy with a one only please pineco next otherwise i want dratinis and larvitars because i need those evolutions actually i looked at the chart and the others i still need are aerodactyl gligar and skarmory i randomly saw a miltank on the sightings yesterday and tracked it down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have gotten a few each of pineco too many gligar and a few others always disappointing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had this no eggs at all from level to hit the day of gen forced all my eggs out got in a row ended up with a mantine pineco larvitar and a skarmory havent seen a since hatched around eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perfect one coooool
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pseudowoodo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,those are guys though right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ouch im so sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that is seriously disappointing so sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im at dratini and mantine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep and of course it has been her buddy ever since
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,huh i was thinking never mind ive gotten pinecos gilgars and martines for the most part edit and another gilgar and pineco
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,total of pineco in the last weeks im not kidding pogo hates me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can start out with the httpgrimecraftbandcampcomalbumpokp especially pokéace ft kevin villecco give it a listen d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been listening to in the car a lot lately
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i always listen to glitchxcity when i want great pokemon remixes heres her playlist some of the stuff in there isnt pokemon related but the majority is enjoy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this would be my favourite track hope others enjoyed this too its from goldsilver edit its not a remix though but the original tunes are still awesome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpsloudrfmreleasepokemonreorchestratedkantosymphonyytsmr
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,neat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,psychic type victory road
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokemon future funk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the various remixes of the red vs gold battle ive really liked on youtube as well as the creepy remixes of lavender town
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how can anyone forget this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably wont be listening to much pokemon to be honest ill probably be listening to my cassettes more to save battery but this site is my preferred one for listening to music httpjetsetradiolive
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is seriously one of the best vg albums ive ever heard bought it from them when i saw them mix it live at magfest two years ago and i listened to it the whole drive home those guys know how to put on a show
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thought she might show up here was just listening to her champion cynthia battle remix and johto gym leader remix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,very nice gonna use the battle vs gym leader elite four song to get me pumped before taking over a gym p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,with the new batch of pictures released and the wording on the niantic site blog i am super excited we still dont know about pvp but it appears you can team up and fight together to take down gyms so excited
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or is the haunter just a wild nearby pokemon i am quite curious too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why would vaporeon with two water type moves be effective versus articuno water does neutral damage to ice and flying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just hope they will release them at about cp with no way to obtain candy other than walking that will suffice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if anyone is curious about gen legendaries lugia will probably tier high and hoohs cp is unfair but neither are mewtwo and have solid counters as for the beasts raikou trades zapdoss rock issues for ground entei has the stats to be a viable fire type and suicune has less cp than vaporeon sotheres that lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,am i the only one thinking they will prevent us to drop mewtwo in gyms it will be just too powerful unfair
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,solid facts most likely ಠಠ
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why is everyone making a big fuzz of new pokemons hitting the cp cap or having very good stats without the ability to hold gyms for more than minutes vaporeons running wild and everyone and their grandmothers having a dragonite snorlax army it really doesnt matter if the pokemon had cp to be honest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my aim here to dispel any fears mewtwo will absolutely trash everything we know about balance if you get a mewtwo it will be game breaking im not wise to any damage calculators so i dont have precise numbers to back up my claims so this is basically just a shitpost
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mewtwo is still a dominating force even after generations have been released mega mewtwo y is the best special attacker bias because hes my fav those that disagree cant ignore his stats hes supposed to be broken thats all hes ever been id be disappointed if he wasnt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the real question is how will niantic preserve their rare and legendary status if everyone will be able to acquire them if gyms get filled up by mewtwos then that sort of loses its omfgitsmewtwo factor they have to limit the existence of these legendaries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you completely ignored articuno attacking capabilities countering dragonite and ground types like its nothing it has higher attack stat than lapras and much tankier than jynx meaning itll be the best ice attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is no shelter from the storm dear vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,until the rebalance zapdos was going to be a game changer simply because it would have been by far the best electric type and finally giving a way to beat lapras now that jolteon is great and still incredibly easy to get and lapras is on the decline its no longer that important
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mew gets transform
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mostly agree although i doubt we will see legendaries before gen and im mostly certain that powering up legendaries especially mewtwo would be a tough grind
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not worried about any of these basically i just see them as the things that will replace dragonite as the highest cp in a gym if niantic gets rid of the whole highest cp goes to the top of the gym problem legendaries become worthless
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,summed up pretty well zapdos will be a somewhat useful attacker other two not so useful for attacking none are good for defense as it was pointed out in a thread last week a stone edge rhydon will simply annihilate all birds with double type advantages mewtwo has always been worrying before rebalance well gengar had trash stats most bugs had trash stats our savior parasect wouldnt have stood the slightest chance with the cp difference after rebalance gengar is better now but still too fragile to face mewtwo some bugs got beefed up but fury cutter sure as hell isnt going to have mewtwo kneeling best bet would be to just go with the pure dps route and use dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,zapdos is going to be a beast more solid vaporeon counter than most things barring maybe dragonite venusaur and exeggutor but still struggles vs lapras unless they have dragon pulse resists fighting and neutral to ground which is nice articuno will be a more accessible ice tye powerhouse for anti dragonite but is weak to steel wing still probably better off with cloyster or lapras if you have one weakness to fire and electric and rock is awful cant remember if ice resists itself atm moltres is looking to be a worse arcanine at this point worse typing with no real added benefits that we know of zapdos will have the most impact between the three mewtwo will be a beast but we already knew that would happen im hoping for a legendary limit in gyms so we dont have level gyms full of mewtwo or a limit along those lines banning them from gyms entirely would be a bad move imo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in before i catch a cp mewtwo and end up schooling pidgeys and rattatas all day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mewtwo vs blissey no contest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep saying basically this again and again and yet every time the birds come up at least three people chime in yet again brainlessly rehashing the i hope they wont be released cause itll break the game but cheers on continuing to try to educate people zapdos sounds like itll have a positive effect on gym balance dragonite lapras snorlax gyarados and vaporeon the current gym favorites will all gain a weakness while rhydon and golem the current highcp unfavored stepchildren of gym battles will gain a use i do hope mewtwo wont be released before episode though or that it will be limited to per person
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel like im forced to point out that mew is no longer a legendary pokemon httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikimythicalpokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,judging from the fact a level can clear a level gym regardless of whats in it im gonna say legendaries will do nothing big
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,new formula doesnt work with pokemon that have equal stats thus mew sucks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mewtwo and legendary birds legendary class pokémon should be given through special events however for mew the only mythic class pokémon of gen should be given as a reward of gold medals achievement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if they fixed the stabse balance mew would be really interesting you never know what move its going to have so its just a gamble on who itll be super effective against but as it is even if it is se thats only as good as if it just had a neutral stab move anyway so its not a big deal also since youre probably fighting it several times to bring down the gym by the second time the surprise is over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,imo moltres will be by far the most vulnerable of legendaries being hit harder by electric water rock and supereffective against grass bugwhich nobody will bother to use because of double weakness sucks to be valor but hey i want that legendary anyway despite typing weaknesses the stats of legendaries are pretty high and get them high up in gymsalthough i do not admire putting dragonites just because they have high cp other than that great attackers and i doubt that legendary birds will be available for every player i was thinking about pvp tournament times a year once the system is implemented the winner gets a legendary egg according to the team which he belongs to about mewmewtwo maybe a global reallife event once a year or a series of quests or maybe kind of a calamity to obtain a pokemonif anyone played zu online you know what i mean
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have thougt about this and the way i would release legendaries would be with two restrictions not being able to put them on gyms and have some sort of cooldown for attacking other gyms maybe hours so you can use them once a day as a pokemon longtime fan i dont think it would be good for the game to have every gym with a mewtwo at the top followed by a few legendary birds that makes no sense to me if niantic forbids the legendaries in gyms then they will continue to be kind of special kind of the other solution would be to release them with low cp and make it actually dificult to obtain candy and level them up i seriously dont want to see every gym with a mewtwo on top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id better start powering up my pinsirs for the mewtwo invasion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vaporeon is the clowndog of the sea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mew is famous to learn other moves easily i hope that they take this in consideration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i suspect there will be no way to obtain multiple of the same legendary meaning that regardless of how powerful mewtwo is each player will have to either use him on offense or defense and even then he can only be in one gym at a time and lets be honest with dodging a single dragonite will be able to take out a defending mewtwo with ease so its not exactly game changing when on defense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still think the best simple solution is legendary drop allowed per gym maybe more allowed later on when more genslegendaries have been released granted as you argued many legendaries are not imbalanced at all but something has to be done for the few and eventually many that are you could have legendary and super legendary to seperate the balanced from the imbalanced ones but that would be weird flavorwise aleternatively you could just make legendaries rare enough that few players possess them but this is not a good way to generate hype and money p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they should be released in the game but it may be better that they cannot be used in gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,based on this post i expect well get legends at level and it will be impossible to get candy to power up or they will require like a candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hope gyms have something like one legendary slot so every gym doesnt end up with legendaries in it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this isnt really an analysis without numbers its just educated guessing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mewtwo may be scoring a bit high on the absurditometer its almot like the intended on it being the epitome of completely broken design like it wouldnt even be fun to battle against unless you were battling a toddler i dont think it would even be very fun to use using mewtwo for anything is like saying i dont really want to play i just want to ruin everyone elses experience it is just so brokenly stacked that it doesnt even seem like youd be playing a game at that point youd really just be erasing things my alakazam currently feels close to that but he legitimately feels like a glass cannon mewtwo does not look like he will feel like glass mew on the otherhand does look strong but it looks like it will just be more of a fun pick because you would really be slotting your mew based off what its charge attack counters it actually sounds like mew will be a lot of fun to collect as well just to have all of teh mew i almost think mewtwo should have hella restrictions like you cant use it in just just any gym and like walking distance when set as a buddy people with maxed out mewtwo would pretty much have to be marathon runners i would even go so far as to suggest that all mewtwo should be level upon capture and make buddy distance the only method to get any candy at all for it make people earn that broken power level people could capture as many as they want no candy from capturing them all mewtwo start out at the lowest possible level and require per candy when walked as a buddy you want to power up a bunch of mewtwo then i commend you lol i am thinking mons could take him down so even as a boss you could just flee after the first on every gym clear until you could overwhelm him i guarantee you would see very few at the top of gyms with the setup i proposed as it would take an epic long time for each one to be powered up enough to surpass the commonly strong defenders that can be captured at level wed eventually see some level mewtwos out there but getting to level is insane amounts of candy for every mon with per candy level mewtwos would be a longterm rarity id also be surprised if players spend time powering up more than one at that rate with new gens coming out and new stuff that youd want to add to your roster being available edit mewtwo is their trump card right now i bet they do it on the year anniversary of launching the game it would draw back a ton of players and they would want the game to be much more polished when they play that card to try and retain as many of those players as possible with the restrictions i proposed it would be far less broken than it looks on paper a high level mewtwo would be a milestone that took a ton of effort forgone resources and distance walked that few players would repeat or even attempt with other legendary choices being available
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait the stats for the legendaries have been found where did op get these numbers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think the simplest solution to mewtwo is a cooldown after battling with it or placing it in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been feeling the same about the birds they will good attackers and pokedex entries and also look nice in gyms unless everyone is able to get them relatively easily like ditto but will get rolled hard by rock types my omastar is waiting this is why i want a legacy one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the really important question is how will ivs be determined especially if you can only get of each legendary
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol we wont be able to level up these pokemon if theres only one each for each trainer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only one for each trainer of each legendary when you get them they wont be higher than level you have to decide walk with them to push them or put them low cp in gyms no game changer at all it will cost you to push them to the limit possible you get them with so you need candys to push them to thats for one legendary
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mewmewtwo will go down to a couple of gyarados purebiting i bet maybe gyarados for mew for mewtwo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mew will be my favorite pokemon by far it has very good stats overall charge move with extreme diversity which means it has the potential to deal with any pokemon as an attacker which is what i like the most zapdos moltres and articuno are ideal for attack too for their counters mewtwo well its psychic so it doessnt have a strong pokemon to counter in this generation so meh as for defence i think mewtwo will be the best mew second to best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,articuno will kick out dragonites that will effect to current gym system
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what if i told you that i picked team mystic to get articuno when it is relseased because there is no way a legendary bird is weaker than a common pokemon even if they have to write the whole stats from cratch to make it happen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cp mewtwo no further opportunities for candies via buddy system lol not god tier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they really need to limit gyms to legendary each otherwise cities will just become stack of mewtwos forever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,re mewtwo km per candy candy per power up spawns extremely lowlevel if pogo has anything got to do with the games story its just been born after all will take quite a while until it comes even close to damaging the balance d that is if theyd rebalance mewtwo to such values any less seems deadly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting post i just wanted to say that one weakness electricground is not neutral defensive typing imo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id take the move lists on silph road currently with a grain of salt niantic has given a lot of pokemon offtype moves see gyarados seaking but theres still some logic to them gyarados is a dragon seaking has a horn hence why gyarados learns two dragontype moves and why seakings mishmash of moves mostly relate to being poked by a sharp horn articunos make no sense aqua jet and xscissor as charge moves and zapdos and moltres only make a bit more sense mew and mewtwo are inbetween from a story perspective it makes some sense that they have crazy moves but it seems completely insane to me that they would stick a legendary with draining kiss i disagree with your assessment of articunos typing as it stands articunos weak to fire electric steel and double to rock but in gen the most powerful rock pokemon are dual groundrock rhydon and golem which take double se from water and se from ice fire is problematic for itif it gets ice moves but if it gets respectable water moves alongside the ice then you basically have an exeggutorlapras situation where they both do se damage on each other and its not a very good time gen brings in rockdark tyranitar but tyranitar is neutral to ice and weak to water moltres is boned but mostly because youre right in that fire is often trivial to deal with but thats just on defense offensively it slots in at least as well as arcanine and probably better and this has been the same for most fire pokemon and againgen is rumored to be coming shortly when that drops mew and mewtwo get tyranitar houndoom and even umbreon as counters so i think this is an okay look and you might be right on the basics but i dont know if we really can predict the future also as an instinct player whos bagged on mystic more than once in his time dont sleep on articuno if you drill down into it its matchups are pretty similar to lapras and no one calls lapras garbage for having a similar weakness against arcanine and flareon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ice is not effective against water same scenario as lapras being countered with arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,think he means for spammers whos strongest poke most likely vap not effective but wont be winning a like people think just a very ugly with old reliable vap
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ice does not very effective damage to water making it vaporeon weak
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in this i imagined a storyline event after pumpeling team rocket out of our gyms mewtwo escapes their grasp the more you contributed the sooner youll meet him post event from that point on tr grunts can spawn as npcs theyre there using legendary candy trying to lure mewtwo defeat them to gain the candy these npc battles would avoid catching muktiple of a unique legendary and provide the chance to batle something besides vaporeon drzgonite snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spoofers or bots will still get the candy running the game this would be worst case scenario where ninantic gives the cheaters the best reward on a silver platter and punishes their loyal non cheating players so either make it so everyone can easily get one or no one if everyone gets one than the gym meta will just be all mewtwos the only possible game balance scenario i could see happen is rebalance mewtwo to not be god status and make it an equivalent amount of work as a dragonite to attain snorlax and lapras doesnt really take work to attain just luck and rng so i would not prefer hatches or super rare spawns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,remember the daily junk threads about buffing alakazam do you want to have to live through that again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just make it so they cant be put in gyms as defenders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when you say them you mean mewtwo right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hope you get mewtwo at an event but youll get an egg or and additional it will be level when hatched and you have to walk per candy and it should burn an high amount of stardust this will lead in a small amount of strong mewtwo those few will offcause rule the gyms but that is well deserved then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,released at lvl and km pokebuddy and ivs at least mewtwo problem solved
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cp it should be really really hard to make them strong d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,vaporeon higher than suicuine cant be right how do their stats compare in the main games
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if anything mewtwo being in gyms is the best we can hope for because hell probably solo everything on attack like its a joke
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its already easy to take down gyms im sure if you have a strong rhydon and dodge his charge moves you would get him in one pokemon most beat much worse ratios for prestiging
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,attacking is so far overpowered that it may actually be good for the gym balance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then what will it be used for collection is great but without gym battling why even release it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyms finally will be challenging i hope they let us drop him in gyms theyll probably limit them to one per player which seems fair
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if we can use mewtwo and the other legendaries it would be a bit interesting if they have a one use per dayuntil it gets booted rule just to limit the use of it as an attacker mewtwo would take down gyms much faster after one gym battle won hed be disabled so using him or other legendaries would require extra thought would i love to use mewtwo all day sure but hm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah it would be the first unfair thing niantic did
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the good old post truth society
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this with current gym mechanics attackers have such a big advantage compounded by the fact that it takes much longer to prestige a gym no pokémon is game breaking when the attacking vs prestige balance is already broke
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the bigger problem in the gym meta is team population balance if i was on team blue where i live i could easily sit in gyms all day after the update maybe all the gyms are t level towers anymore but i can easily identity dozens of stagnant blue controlled gyms on my commute as yellow i can maybe hold multi day gym and try to cap more high turn over gyms if i go after the stagnant blue gyms they just take them back the next day that sounds fair but remembered im out numbered if i stop coming they get to sit and collect when i cap a gym most of the other players are taking it away from me if i was on blue most of the other players would reinforce the gym not attack it i would much prefer this population distribution addressed over any other gym meta issues
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this was my favorite part if bird events end up only giving participants the pokemon from their team valor and mystic might want to save themselves a trip yeah because if the legendaries arent superduperoutstanding in gyms theres no reason to even have them in your pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i suspect they wont do anything to preserve their rare status everyone can get the legendary pokemon in the original games why not here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no limiting the option to get one would be a horrible game design decision one of the objectives if not the main of a pokemon game is complete the pokedex you cant say to your players some of you wont be able to finish the game good luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just make it so gyms can only hold one legendary at a time and its always the leader
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill never understand this argument since red and blue everyone gets to catch one of each legendary mew is literally just given to you in a gift box received from whatever game store is popular at the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that being said in my neck of the world ive only ever more than snorlax in any one gym at any one time i highly doubt ill ever see chansey in any one gym at any one time either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,people cannot keep harping on that the game is designed for casuals while claiming that the legendaries will be restricted in some significant way if the gyms and tracking are like they are for the sake of causals then access to the legendaries will be designed for the casuals as well that might include location or time specific events but theyll be well advertised and before the events well they should be but niantics incompetence here is an issue of implementing the theory not with the theory itself and run for at least a week not saying that you hold these views
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they give them out to people sending away pidgeots
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree but at this point basically everyone has a multiple dragonite lapras and chansey all of which are also supposed to be very rare so they threw all that away long ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i imagine theyll be event based at specific locations with sign ups to participate now how they will make the events competitive while not pissing off people who spent the time and money to show up and didnt win will be interesting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they should just make them a in million spawn chance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,unfortunately the ground types that are likely to be in gyms rhydon and golem will almost always have a stab rock type move too then its goodnight arty
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,articuno has more attack and less bulk maybe a slightly better answer to dnite and thats if you get a blizzard one as for the ground types vaporeon does it way better
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the only groundtypes in the game that dont have stab rock moves are dugtrio nidoking and nidoqueen none of which are seen often in gyms but youre right for offense all the legendaries will be powerful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lapras is super effective against zapdos so game unchanged jolteonmagneton are decent lapras counters yea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thatd actually be pretty cool
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from but dont you think it would be a bit weird to release gen before finishing gen once they release gen everyone will be waiting for the gen legendaries and it would just get further and further out of sync personally im a bit annoyed that the games been out since july and were still waiting to see any legendaries heck we only got ditto last week and thats a standard pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at this stage of the game yeah gen before legendaries is likely either that or theyll do some sortve event to kick off gen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,besides mewtwo dragonite is still the highest cp u
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gen fam but yeah blissey is going to be some kind of stupid if it isnt addressed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mewtwo may be one of the only pokemon to consistently beat a maxlevel blissey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how is dragonite and snorlax weak to zapdos like i guess earthquake snorlax zapdos will resist but that is about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,them theyre going to break the game me yeah but look their cp is lower than gyarados them who is also a legendary god dragon and would break the game if not for the candy wall
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah yeah and the legendary dogs are actually cats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,chansey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cccccchansey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah max cp just ahead of lapras and right before vaporeon its stats are really holding it back s
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as someone who sees tons of exeggutor in gyms moltres will be perfectly useful for me especially since arcanine got nerfed down a bit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the birds wont be at the top only zapdos clears gyaradoss cp and articuno doesnt even clear vaporeons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it doesnt work that way i wish it did but it honestly doesnt work that way even at max cp loads of pokemon out damage pinsir vs psychic types
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id suggest saving some eevee candies and hoping gen ii is out after legendaries so you can be like me with my planned army of umbreon espeon will actually be very high cp and will resist psycho cut and confusion as well so he could be a good pick too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe mewtwo but im fine with the rest of them zapdos will definitely make a positive splash in gym diversity
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we have their stats and movesets if you compare them to existing pokemon and their performance wellthere you go its not like im pulling all this out of my butt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the pogo stats for pokemon are the stats from the normal pokemon games put through a formula so unless they spot buffnerf the legendaries these ought to be their stats httpsthesilphroadcomresearch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,their moves are in the game code along with them and their cps can be determined by the formula used for the base stats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pogo stats are based off the old games so its reasonable to assume the legendaries will as well gamepress pogo site has their stats and possible movesets on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont get why people are so obsessed with using super effective moves that dont have stab bonuses super effective is just as beneficial as stab i slightly prefer stab because its easier to see when the enemy is using a charged move if there is no benefit to super effective to stab since in this case you cant have both why not just pick your strongest mon and ignore typing dragonite or snorlax is a much better pick against mewmewtwo than gyarados
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokemon for is p op tbh like wyd when the gym has mewtwo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but gyarados doesnt get stab on bite its as good as any other move with stab
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeh tbh gyarados will be a good counter to mewtwo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not exactly how the game works stab bonus is equal to super effective damage and mews quick attack is pound mews stats will carry it far but itll be far from second best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,larpas cloyster and dewgong arguably do it better i mean dnites best defensive sets carry steel wing which articuno is weak to sothere you go i know dnite has high cp but hes never bothered me much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your legendary bird kneels before the lord helix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do people who say this live in a place where gyms are stacks of dragonites forever sure i usually see a fairly small collection of different pokemon in gyms but its far from all dragonites people will still not have a mewtwo or not want to put their mewtwo in a gym or have put their mewtwo in a gym already same as the current highest cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,flying tho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cant even begin to tell if youre being serious or not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not weak but resisted with articuno high statsmovesets attacking a defending vape would take a while but will be easy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or you knowspin a sponsored pokestop for a mewtwo egg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that would be neat too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all of the legendary pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or just have spoofers running wild with them large barrier with large reward will always bring the worst out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,except a bot will completely break this mechanic so only botters and cheaters would be getting mewtwo to start the game would have to be at a point to catch all botters before doing this suggestion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i love the and higher egg idea could use it for legendaries or whatever throw something new into the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,even at ivs mewtwo has far and away the highest cp and stats in the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used to battle competitively and vape was always used more than suicune mostly for wish passing but thats a whole new ballpark tbh most legendarys stats arent all that impressive unless theyre the versions mascot very few ever found competitive usage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,suicune has a bit more defstamina but vaporeon has more attack which is weighed more for the cp formula
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well suicune was a rebirth of vaporeon right so it probably lost some power
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,suicune has better stats overall in the main games but vaporeon is more specialised which is a good thing now and as someone else said has higher attack than suicune in go which skews the cp formula towards it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,he must be real fun to use in attack though hes going to be overpowered in defense like a dragonite on steroids but not so easy to take down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats what i think if we all only get one i think most people will want to keep it as an attacker to plow through gyms cant do that if its already in one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it will be great spoofed mewtwos everywhere s until the cheating is addressed i hope they dont release super powerful rare pokemons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,justmake it impossible to power up after lvl problem solved lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i said drop it in gyms i would make it not possible to use for defense but surely possible and useful for attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blissey may be able to do that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mean you have a point but i dont want to see gyms stacked with nothing but mewtwos that wouldnt be fun at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ikr think how far ppl will travel for a farfetchd now think about how far ppl will travel for a farfetchd that will only be available for a limited time now replace farfetchs with anything iconic and you got an event reaplace it with something that is gamebreaking and you got a problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,forget legendaries lets go farm another million snorlaxs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the difference is everyone in the original games were playing in their own world in pokemon go we all exist in the same one world but i agree about them probably not doing anything to preserve their rare status
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,game freak always did that in the early days now with internet is different but first pokemon events were phisically located in japan and you had to wait a lot of time you still have to wait a lot for events i didnt find it but i saw a video once talking about how much time in years of pokemon you could have a complete pokedex and it was very few time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and here im building an all chansey gym with my local squad tonight haha stay strong friend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dude have you seen my electric fearow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i walked a dratini for what seemed like an eternity for my dragonite found my first chansey just a few days ago at and have never seen a lapras anywhere but a gym or a snorlax for that matter i guess im getting the real experience
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont have dragonite im level with in the dex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are we supposed to have a lapraschansey oo i got my dragonite after months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,almost always well its a chance for rock throw on golem and rhydon dont have any rock fast attacks both can learn stone edge but if you dodge it well your articuno will survive and its a full bar so they might even not get to use it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,articuno actually has the highest defense stat in the game and a considerable amount of hp im not saying vaporeon isnt good but you treated articuno in your post like its completely useless not even given a section for itself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but not every rockground type has a rock moves on it mud slapearthquake golem for example plus youve forgot sandslash even though i agree they are rarely defending a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from but dont you think it would be a bit weird to release gen before finishing gen no they do this regularly in the main series games a good handful of legendary pokemon in a generation are not released until the next
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,something like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so mewtwo becomes the new dragonite just need to build up mewtwo counter then gen rollout will go fine for me then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eq will be neutral to lord zapdos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im guessing we should make all pokémon exactly equally powerful then nah thatd probably break the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyarados has bad attacks and is not remotely game breaking even with the substantial buff to stats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really think its good that gyarados got a buff hes worth candy now well not with twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blissey more like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ur kinda dumb
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lapras is getting nerded to sobthere is that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonite perhaps but gyarados is a better attacker than snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah but i only have dragonites snorlax and a dozen gyarados p much much easier to come by
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then you kill run healrevive rinse and repeat its not the end of the world
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as will lickhyper beam or body slam snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it has better stats for defense than the birds and their fast attacks arent great either so his diversity in charge move is what makes it better imo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you go to cities it often gets like this in savannah there were gyms near each other each of them had or more dragonites when you get into big cities the number of players per gym increases and things can get out of hand based on pogos population vs roughly how many can play in the world if nyc had a representative number of people there would be players in there right now if only of them have a single dragonite thats dragonites in nyc there are quite a few gyms there but enough to spread out that many dragonites and im betting my number is a low ball even if not every player or actually very few players get mewtwo any large population center can get overrun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it wont be game changing and using a vileplum will yield better results probably but i still feel like articuno will be a godsend to those without the rare ice type pokes when it comes to taking down dragonites with or without steel wing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but why would you use articuno to attack vape
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not all the countries have sponsored pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive always thought it would be cool if they made it another collectiontype game for a period of time each pokestop you spin has some chance of spitting out a piece of a puzzle get enough pieces of one puzzle and a legendary pokemon will show up for you to catch sort of like mcdonalds monopoly game thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im hoping for eggs just so that the legendaries get good ivs nothingll frustrate me more than a perfect mewtwo with shadow ball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic could do that when all is said and done its their decision personally i prefer to work a bit for my legendaries back in and gf distributed key items which unlocked the area to battle mythicals in these days they just get handed to you by a ups person at the pokécenter the latter feels anticlimatic imho
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a egg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,buying a happy mmeal or big mac set to get a code allowing one encounter with a random legendary could happen too looking at the ditto release and the lapras event i dont think legendaries will be rare or hard to get
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mmm crocune in gen though what an annoying strat xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,suicune had some use in gen competitive it was suicune milotic and vaporeon as your goto bulky water or swampert if your team didnt mind the loss in water resistance he carried they just did different things suicune i believe was a calm mind set primarily
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nowadays vaporeon is almost never seen but i see a lot of suicune with calm mind and it is definitely op
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not true suicune is god in uu and its a mircale its not banned vap is good and one of the counters to it but not a team sweeper
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly it probably wouldnt be a huge problem for gen you have jinx with nonpsychic moves exeggutor with seed bomb and pinsir with fury cutter xscissor any of those three should be able to tackle a mewtwo of relatively high cp on their own with perfect dodging and they have movesets that allow for perfect dodging against psychic when generation comes out well have scizor who will likely be a hard psychic counter boasting decent defense values a resistance and a stab se option that no psychic types will be neutral to well also have dark pokemon like houndoom who hopefully will bring new moves like crunch maybe to the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats why i fully expect the legendaries to be available only in sf for an event for a limited time they know people will come from the response to the lapras event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are we in the same world if a pokemon spawns and both of us can catch it how are we in the same world in pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you still can only put it in one gym at a time plus not all of them will he
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and it sucked exactly for that reason
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,other than mew and celebi in the early days all pokemon were legitimately obtained ingame now that there are more than mystic pokemon per gen its harder to get them all but at the same time its easier because of the internet mew was accessible in emerald celebi in hgss and in newer games much more frequent
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so basically a gym that can be taken down entirely with vapes at most and zero potsrevives spent doesnt look like a good idea to me i suppose your going for the trolling angle of being long and boring to take down but even then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you mean the articundo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still only halfway to a dragonite and thats because we went to the beach for a week on vacation no snorlax no chanseywife got one form an egghave hatched two larpas but one was low level so its cp isnt very good the above expectation is if you live in a big city
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,chance says your articuno gets icy wind u and why youd use it over vaporeon for hitting grounds is beyond me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,highest defense stat in the game you mean cloyster right highest onix i didnt say its completely useless i said we already have stuff that does its job better all things considered moltres is probably better than articuno over all if you really want me to separate them u
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whoah that was pretty cool to watch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gen ii will give us houndoom umbreon and tyranitar personally i think that even though umbreon got hit pretty hard with the nerf bat after the cp changes well in a manner of speaking given that it never actually had the predicted cp the fact that most people are drowning in eevee will mean that mewtwo will fall easily to an army of umbreon give him some good moves like bite and hell take mewtwo and mew easily areas that are drowning in growlithe will probably be filled with houndour as well so thatll be another nail in mewtwos coffin
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,holds an egg in its pouch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,times out most level players at cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you got me p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sauce i know lapras should have been nerfed by the new formula but isnt it by design that it didnt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not in the slightest snorlax is the best attacker in the game as long as were talking about dueling ability which i think we are when were talking about taking down a mewtwo gyarados has higher dps but dies more easily this spreadsheet has the updated duelers gyarados is definitely solid but even with the super effective bonus he doesnt match up to snorlax dragonite or vaporeon and also probably laprasrhydon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wont and nobody should but you use vape as a parameter so obviously i need to use the same parameter if i want to object your point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent seen one yet in person i dont have the new tracker yet either but as soon as the game gets centered around pokestops worldwide which is coming you can be sure sponsored stops will become way more common
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i assure you they will im sure theres just a lot of haggling going on and contracts being made
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and you really think they care ask rural players how much love they receive from niantic i do not think they will make it that way but the reason for it wont be not all countries have sponsored pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they could easily flip a switch and make every pokestop a mewtwo egg one or whatever doesnt have to be sponsored
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cool idea too bad the city players can walk and get stops faster than i can in my little town id probably get enough but it would be hours of grinding instead of a couple hours walking the stop district
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im okay with grinding but niantic seems to be insistent on giving this game to the casuals would not be surprised if they make it relatively easy for people who have invested less time to get legendaries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol yea just making a joke due to all the ditto hype and secret theoriesand it ended up to beanti climactic i would love an exciting storyline thing i just dont think it will happen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the probably stopped doing the former because there was no way for people in countries that gf didnt pay attention to to get those legendaries and they realized that people will keep playing older games for nostalgia and want a complete pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i agree they will probably limit legendaries to the team your on just so not everybody can get every bird but thats about it i expect legendary bird to be obtained in less than a week work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at a tournament me and my friend ended up in the final match all of our pokemon defeated but his calm mind rest talk milotic and my calm mind rest talk suicune
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,from what i last saw the meta was pure grueling stall with high paced rapid stall breaking but that was like a year ago i ran this weird team where or of the pokemon had taunt because stall was the thing to do and im not going to live that life it was a wild ride full of mind games and im glad i took a hiatus from it haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly ill probably stick to gyarados and arcanine with bite and snorlax with lick maybe dragon breath dragonite or frost breath lapras just because theyre good attackers bug types have way too little health and defense to not get murdered by mewtwo exeggutor would be fairly good too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol are you serious this thread is about legendaries affecting gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lvl
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,were just testing her out as a defender all chansey gym gym with high cp chansey on the bottom gym with ok cp chansey reports indicate that a high cp chansey can lock out level and under depending on circumstances and thats primarily whos clipping our gyms so
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyre both terrible thats your quotation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,glad you like it one of these weeks im gonna animate a way to encounter mew if sumo stops eating my time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that cant be right i killed one on a level acct with a barely leveled vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok were talking about different things in terms of dealing damage gyarados is better i dont use snorlax in battle that often just because he kinda takes a while he wont die and hell almost certainly win but he wont do it as quickly as most other pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes you can point the argument in that direction but that veers drastically away from the point articuno would be trash
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man you really want articuno to be better than what it is dont you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont need to ask rural players anything im semirural myself i have gyms and pokestops in my whole neighborhood which is actually pretty huge id say kms long x kms wide i need to go downtown at least once a week to get supplies otherwise id run out of pokeballs and yeah i do agree that they dont give a sht i personally took pictures of close to statues parks churches and other points of interest in my neighborhood and requested new pokestops for every single one of them the day the game got released and they havent even tried doing anything about it and honestly unless mcdonalds kfc or subway have sponsored pokestops i dont remember seeing any pokestops around them i dont think there are sponsored pokestops in romania we do have starbucks though so if the december leak is real that could change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it wouldnt be fair to people in small towns and such which is a very unfortunate habit niantic has that is designing stuff which doesnt do anything for rural players generally speaking im just lucky enough that theres a place with about pokestops only a minute drive away because my neighborhood hasnt got a whole lot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as long as we get them in a slightly more creative way than a egg falling randomly out of a pokéstop ill be happy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,early ingress was quite different from what it is today if memory serves the first anomaly event was held around a half frozen lake and a couple hundred people showed up not sure if the story with susanna moyer et al was running from the start but unless tpc canwants to legally prevent them from spinning pokémon stories i strongly hope will be birth and refinement of pgo let see the start of story linecampaignsevents
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,half the events are japanonly so people still arent getting all the event pokémon it maybe because people learned to glitch into those hidden areas but were genning mythicals atm so that didnt help much either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rip the audience xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is gyarados all that good for attack mine has twister so i never bothered trying se isnt any better than stab so i would assume a fire fang arcanine or dragon breath dragonite would be superior since theyre also not as squishy as gyarados if they ever change se to actually be more powerful than stab then maybe bitelick will mean something but otherwise using an offensive mon with stab attacks is equally as good as a nonstab se user
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol just to have fun with this what if gyms are just portals that connect each of the worlds which is why when you place a mon in one you cant interact with it anymore as it is no longer in your world but a zone between worlds note i originally just pointed outhad fun with this same worldown world issue only to highlight how we should not use it to justify ifwhenhow many same type legendary we shouldcan get as it should really just be considered as a balance issue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but that is a good point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good for you many arent there yet still can use it in one gym only mewtwo will probably serve you better on hand as an attacker destroying gyms he wont be everywhere nor will he be the ultimate guardian defenders get their level adjusted after all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good luck interesting to hear how that goes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont lvl have an army of vapes where you live eevees are a pest here almost like pidgeys i use them for my lucky egg mass evos and always keep dozens of the evos as disposable attackers use them till fainting then transfer if i need to restock on potsrevs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah they are theyre poor defensively and dont bring anything new to the table you read the whole post right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eh well my team is testing it tonight time to see what happens
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it hasnt been released yet youre theorycrafting we dont know for sure how it will do just yet while we know the stats and potential movesets niantic could surprise us with a few things
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly my point as long as something works in sf niantic wont think about the players in other places if they do a event related to sponsored pokestops i doubt they will be concerned about people without one on their whole towncitycountry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mcdonalds does have a working relationship with nintendotpc and have done events in the past not for pogo but someone found some mcdonalds imagary in the game files
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its impossible to make the game fair to everyone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,except thats basically how i got a dragonite hatched walked the rest about
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive kind of been thinking of starting afresh with pokémon go and maintaining a pokémon go journal ive done well to reach level or so since it came out in britain but i keep longing to start afresh and write it out like a story and take pictures of each pokémon i catch in the wild
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like it hopefully ill still be playing then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there was an announcer who narrated the fights after the first minutes he gave up on us lmao
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if ill be remembered for something on this sub itll be for defending gyarados i love mine as an allaround attacker he has few weaknesses that show up in gyms no one really puts electric types in gyms recently rhydon with stone edge or golem with rock throw or stone edge are possible defenders but he still destroys them with hydro pump so thats not too many points docked from him he resists vaporeon which is very important bite is se against exeggutor a popular defender i see a lot and hes great as a water type that isnt weak to grass he resists fire fang and steel wing too and is neutral taking damage from lapras and snorlax dealing damage he doesnt get stab on bite but its still a very fast and high dps move and he has a good attack stat to back it up hydro pump does a ton of damage and i find its more effective from gyarados than vaporeon gyarados has decent enough health tankier than golduck or starmie and i find he can last quite a while against enemy gyms i often use him over vaporeon because i prefer his hydro pump to be fair all my good vaporeons have water pulse at the moment and because hes far better against grass types like exeggutor and sometimes venusaur the higher attack somewhat makes up for the lack of stab on bite vs water gun especially if he has hydro pump that is getting stab as for defending gyms hes pretty awful i teamed up with a friend today using jolteons against two gyarados we killed both of them before they could even use their charge moves or get us down more than a third of our health even arcanine usually lasts longer as he doesnt have a double weakness
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i meant the max lvl for powering up mons is im not there either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think timetotakedown value is actually the biggest defender of a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably but the math is out a high cp chansey straight up times out certain level players vapes dont matter when they cant down a chansey within seconds
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you need to ignore everything you know from the main series ice is actually good defensively right now and its a crucially important way too rare offensive type first as for defense it probably depends on your biome but here rhyhorn are rare geodude are even rarer and dratini are easily found plus rhydon and golem are both part ground and will take se damage back not to mention neither are guarenteed to even have rock moves so that double rock weakness is not as much of a problem as you might expect and type wise vaporeon will have about as much of an advantage as fire types have over lapras right now which honestly doesnt mean that much with the incredibly reduced type effectiveness bonus but more importantly articuno will probably be used offensively where you get to pick your fights dragonite is everywhere and lapras is so rare that increasing the supply of decent ice attackers even a little bit could be really meaningful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes of course and i agreed with you on mewtwo and mew
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are not wrong iirc niantic didnt nerf lapras despite the new formula supposedly priming it for a nerf i didnt follow that thread too closely but the idea is niantic preserved laprass original higher cp its possible that theyd spot buff the birbs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is there a list of businesses with sponsored pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure but i dont believe its impossible to help out rural people or make some of these events work just as well for them as for urban people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonite is a pseudo you can catchbreed multiple in the same save file call me spoiled but maingames got me primed for storyline legendaries
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,let me know when you publish your journal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fantastic pokemon and where to find them p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did it end in a struggleoff
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really i thought it was trainer lvl plus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think youre missing the point sure everyone can only put their mewtwo in one gym but that still means there will be mewtwo in every gym the most competitive players will have the strongest and you will expect to see them everywhere alongside the usual vaps and dragonites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea i agree which is why i am interested to hear how a chansey built gym works out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then it looks like you need to recheck your maths i just run a simulation between a vape ivs with water pulse vs a chansey with ivs and the vape could finish it with to spare without dodging if we make it with hydro pump hell beat it with to spare even dodging charge moves edit actually i just checked that same vape with ivs can beat a ivs even dodging charging moves with time to spare im not really feeling your time out argument
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,defensively ice offers nothing other than stab ice attacks which covers waters grass weakness and makes them effectively have no weakness due to how much love fighting rock and electric dont get in this game and wards off dragonite it does absolutely nothing to help flying types other than to compound their weaknesses offensively anything with high attack stats can be good i have hatched lapras but at the end of the day i only need to make articuno moot iirc cloyster is a solid poor mans option of attack boasts more defense than articuno and only less attack and has significantly less hp but this is attack were talking aboutthat said if you dont have a lapras using articuno on offense could be a slight boon against dragonite but thats about it i wont recognize articuno as a solid offensive option against our groundrocks while vaporeon melts them with doubled up damage bonuses neutral damage from all of their attacks and a higher attack stat and bulk at that as for grass types we already have a wide host of fire types to deal with them so like i said articuno is a poor defensive option and doesnt bring anything new to the table for offense it will be an offensive option of course just as much as you can use a flareon instead of an arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know any list i have heard mcdonalds but not sure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nah it was critburn and then crit that sealed the deal some bs though lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am and my max out pokemon show as so it looks like its trainer level so at you can power them up to and thats it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes but it caps at level for pokemon i believe once you hit level you can power up a pokemon one more time and then its completely maxed out the powerup bar literally disappears
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after lvl you are unable to power your pokemon up anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was just correcting the lvl point not disagreeingagreeing with anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theoretically there could be mewtwos per gym but while trainers can have muktiple vaporeon and dragonite assuming main game logic you only have one mewtwo guarding gyms is not his role
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have varying reports on chanseys effectiveness some yay some nay my local squad is actually testing her out tonight ourselves so i guess ill see for myself how well it does in real life and not in a simulation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not arguing articuno is gonna make waves on defense but the fact it can hit its counters se counts for something will trade se hits with zapdos as well so it can potentially be annoying the way psychic slowbro is but anyway my point is that it could change the meta if its widely distributed bc of its offense you have lapras which is pretty sweet level with none here but anyway even with relatively good lapras luck you probably dont have more than a few and you have to choose between using them to hold gyms or to take them and have a limited amount of candy to work with if you are facing high level gyms full of dragonite this is a real trade off since a single lapras cant actually take giant dragons and seelcloyster are rare with multiple crap movesets for their evolutions which are still subpar if articuno is widely distributed like everyone gets one this could make a real difference tbh with the current gym system matchups dont really matter at all where i live gyms dont reach high levels and random crap has about as good of a chance of staying as maxed out snorlax havent seen a gym last more than hours period so honestly i feel a bit silly debating the value of anything at all but if we ever go back to anything like the system we had before articuno could make a real impact
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mcdonalds has had sponsored pokestops only in japan as far as i know this was back in july i think so im not sure what the situation is right now however i did visit mcdonalds in my city and i havent seen any pokestops around
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that bug was fixed months ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hits its counters se arcanine flareon and omastar all resist articuno and hit back se then we have jolteon magneton charizard and water gun water types as another level of counter by either getting hit neutral or getting the resist in like i said before vaporeon technically counters articuno i make up for my lapras luck with my low iv eq snorlax lol eggs are where its at if you want to get one i never put my frost breathice beam one in gyms just to slap around dnite my cp fb one can take out dnites before going down if i dodge well as for cloysters movesets frost breath is best for offense ice shard is best for defense both blizzard and hydropump are solid moves for either especially since ice shard doesnt need charge moves help icy wind is unfortunate though this is compared to articuno who will most likely be very hard for someone to get of who only gets frost breath and who also has the chance to to pack icy wind itself cloyster and dewgong arent rare i have multiple high ivcp ones on hand then again i live by a river so that biome articuno will be solid in favorable match ups on offense but it doesnt do anything we can already do in multiple ways as for defense its still a stat monster but its poor typing will hold it back from greatness edit also i totally forgot dnites best defensive moveset carries steel wing which hits articuno for se damage because its iceflying not icewater so rip
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,has it i recently reached lv and was only able to power up once when the powerup button disappeared are you saying the powerup button will rerun onceif i hit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not a bug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bug its not possible lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ivs arent super important no but those two are close enough in ivs that i would just do the victreebel are pretty useful so you may as well use the better of the two
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this isnt really the place for powerupevolving questions youll get better answers at httpswwwredditcomrpokemongoivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are you planning to continue powering it up after you evolve it if no go with the higher cp if yes go with the higher iv
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah ok my bad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do plan on powering it up but i guess my question is whether a difference of cp in the end is worth it since thats already around candies just getting the lower one powered up to the level of the stronger one would already be is there a calc where you can see the difference in max cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you plan to power it up the difference in cp is pretty much nothing at some point you cant power it up any more and the pokemon with better ivs will have more cp at that point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can select the infinite incubator first in the bottom corner and then select the egg found it after having the same problem multiple times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,last night i incubated km egg with infinite incubator instead km egg and today same thing happned meh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cool thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a well known mechanic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but only if its max hp increased upon leveling up evolving fully heals as well been known since pretty much day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think this happend on mainline games too if you lvl up a fainted mon with a rare candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well im just confirming it still works then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oooooh i see what you mean
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my own thread i noted that out of of my starters today came from incense used as a passenger in a car
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im seeing about in incense spawns as starters it may be dependent on the biome youre in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was hunting a blastoise shadow in sightings popped an incense hoping it might come to me small ivysaur appeared at my feet definitely from the incense tracked down the blastoise as well cp with decent but not great iv pleased with both
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i walked for minutes with an incense and encountered a squirtle and a bulbasaur with the pink rings around them i do see squirtles in this area from time to time but never saw a bulbasaur around here before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im surprised that people still think this is how incense works it doesnt attract existing pokémon to you it spawns pokémon available only to you although arguably the first way of thinking would be better
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre just running slower
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if theyre slower to spin thats probably adding those few seconds that you used to have to wait onto your run
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just did a spin still minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is a bug i guess which makes pokestops turn blue after just minute but it does not let you spin until minutes past
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not a bug that will be because your phone clock is not on automatic time so its out by mins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is on automatic but that can very well be the case thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whoever ends up with a cubone nest is going to be upset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the migration pace is very inconsistent there is no precise way to know when the next one will happen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first great migrations were about to a month then the last have been about every weeks for all we know it might be a month again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe on i think spawns will be reshuffled after event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the silphroad nest atlas lists the great migrations presumably the go live aug sep oct oct
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i assume great migration means a nest change is there something different that constitutes a migration curious
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do nest locations change or does niantic recycle current nests
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you got a cubone for that comment xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nest near me has been cubone nest since the last migration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,havent come across cubone nest but ive been running into them more often idk if its event related or what but its starting to get a little annoying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pleaselet this be true feels like i am being pulled in so many directions with these shorter rotations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as do i ill be opening up shop at my growlithe nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looks like a refresh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,since nests tend to change all together or not at all nest change great migration thats why the nest atlas resets after a migration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what lol its the halloween event they are part of it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just found an eggecute nest yesterday so yes please be a month or more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if your looking for an average yes it seems to be three weeks but it was days at first however i can all but guarantee you that a nest migration is preceded by a change in regular spawns and youll usually hear about it hours prior my experiance on this sub from someone asking if anyone else has noticed a change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes but shortly before the event my region got a cubone nest i am praying for something else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nest location
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh my im sorry have a flipped table on me ╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its possiblei used to hunt in an area with dratinis spawning about every hour or so then after the update i began seeing lots of dragonairsi got in an hour at one point but less dratinis were spawning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dratinis and dragonairs are definitely linked and they spawn in place of magikarps people have posted that they increased the rates recently for rares so this could be the reason for more dragonairs im pretty sure dragonites arent linked to dratinis though as they have been found to spawn where clefairys should just an increase with rares and luck with the dragonites happy to be proven wrong though would love a switch up from dratinis dragonites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught a gyrados at sm pier where magikarp spawn all the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its the time ive seen a dragonite in my sightings while inside my house i havent noticed any patterns or anything but i will start to keep track since the last time i saw one was on a monday during my time yesterday tuesday i saw a dratini in my sightings around pm but i still dont know if this is common or just luck since i havent managed to catch a single dratinidragonairdragonite even though it appeared in my sighting list most of the times i just get zubats weedles caterpies clefairys while sitting at home on a daily basis
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a slowbro spawn tonight in a spot were i see about six slowpokes a day there are also psyducks there and the past two weekends there has been a goldduck i think there is something to this cycle but i havent cracked it yet maybe it means a gyrados will be there soon to complement the karps that also appear there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a huge clefairy nest just a little out of my way i should really go look for a dragonite there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got to agree that dratini and dragonair are from the magikarp spawns while dragonite is different the only two dragonites ive seen confirm the altitude theory as they were on hills that also spawned gengars nidoqueens and snorlax but never dratini or dragonair
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree i went to a state park the other day and there were dratinis spawning semi frequently after that a dragoniar spawned no dragonite though but still it is pretty interesting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hang around a certain area for several hours a night the last weeks and keep going back to check it since dratini spawn there separate spawn points where the dratini might appear the spawners put out psyduck magikarp slowpoke staryu rarely dratini and even rarer dragonair there was a time when suddenly there started being more golduck slowbro starmie etc then less than a week ago a gyarados indeed appeared for the only time ive ever seen it and i havent seen any slowbro or golduck etc in the last few days so maybe it really is a cycle but anyway gyarados do come out of those spawners but only extremely rarely dragonite do not ive seen dragonites in that suburb and none were anywhere near the dratini spawners i assume gyarados are so rare you will probably catch enough magikarp to evolve your own before ever seeing one at a magikarp spawner though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think the link between clefairy and dragonite spawns was altitude they spawn higher up so perhaps your nest is just an individual nest rather than an area that may have increased spawns of clefairydragonites this makes sense as my hometown is high up and has many many clefairies yet to see a dragonite but a friend has one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,using multiple devices is very obviously against the tos and others have reported having accounts banned for things like spouses being logged into the same account at the same time so at best this is cheating and morally wrong at worst you are literally telling people to do something that will make them lose their account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is an exploit and considering how the previous method was patched out i think what youre proposing is very likely to result in bans for people who do it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aka how to possibly get banned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thx for the tip ban for this is unlikely having two accounts is a risk but that is morale question and its not your problem so once again thx fro the tip those that want to try will those that do not wont but we have no right to judge you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually logging into the same account on multiple devices alone doesnt do anything the worst thing that will happen is you will get soft banned if your two devices are very far apart and you trigger actions in the game like spinning a pokestop and im not forcing anyone to do anything you do it at your own risk like they say if you cant handle the fire stay out of the kitchen p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the threefinger trick was a mistake on niantics part and allowed players to easily powerup past max sometimes without intending to it would be foolish to ban players for it especially ones who powered up without knowing and those pokemon that were poweredup up are still poweredup makes me wonder what theyre doing since there are tons of spoofers with hundreds of pokemon if they cant even bother to do anything about those accounts why should we expect anything different from this of course there is still a risk when you do this but judging from niantics track record with ingress i doubt its very likely to result in a ban
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anything is obviously above and beyond as far as cheating goes i used multitough xploit myself to get some pokes boosted but like i said multiple phones is definitely blatantly sketchy and likely to result in repercussions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are right that the multitouch was niantics fault but this is clearly something different ive seen people writing about using two phones to mass evolve and gotten banned so use at your own risk indeed personally if you are already at high levels its not worth the risk eventually niantic will up the level cap
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its blue and simply means that pokemon was caught within the last
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also you may want to get tested for colorblindness if you havent been already
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpsthesilphroadcomtipsandnewsblueglowaroundpokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,recently caught
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it means u need to use the search function
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,isnt it bluish green i dont think im color blind but thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i appreciate all the answers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you very much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well if they were searching for green circle they probably wouldnt find blue glow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its blue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think the green background makes it look green but when i look closer it definitely is blue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,check the ingress map at ingresscomintel you have to sign in but you can search your area and check out the portal density you may have to zoom in to see any uncapped portals it should give you a good idea of how your area will translate in pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to save you some work i checked out pakistan on the intel map it is definitely very devoid of portals at a glance i found maybe in lahore most other townscities have where i have in my figurative back yard within of my house and there are thousands within thus far ive heard that fairly consistently portal locations are becoming stopgyms not to give up hope though they did just introduce code in ingress to regionally lock portal submissions meaning that they havent completely dismissed location submissions why work on code youre never going to use again id retain hope that youll see more spots become active spread the word show niantic there is a market there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,were in similar boats ill be lucky if theres one pokestop within a range of km or any within the km after that unfortunately the portals were all collected from early ingress players who submitted locations in their area which means if the place where you live didnt have active ingress players during that period you wont have portals and therefore no pokestops or gyms the portal submissions were closed well over a year ago and as far as i know has no word on being reopened but im keeping fingers crossed that theyll allow new pokestops in places that dont have any or very few and am scouting out the places of interest in my town in preparation not giving up the dream of being able to play this great game some day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokestops and gyms correspond directly with existing ingress portals all portals from ingress seem to have been converted to pokestops with gyms where there are two or more portals in a close area to see all the ingress portals in your area youll need to sign up for ingress pick a faction i suggest the resistance so you can be team blue in both games and then go to ingresscomintel to look at the portal map the benefit of pokemon go is that you dont have to travel around to play as much as you do in ingress the tall grass or wild areas where pokemon spawn are generated the same way xm and scoring are done in ingress by population density this means that if you live in a city in an apartment complex or a cozy neighborhood you can probably catch pokemon from the safety of your own home youll only have to leave if you want to visit a pokestop or a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i recall hearing that niantic may have reactivated portal submissions in japan to a limited degree there were so many people submitting portal locations in ingress that it was becoming impossible to keep up with a huge backlog of portal submissions there is a badge in ingress for finding submitting new portals when pokemongo was announced it likely drew a lot of new players to ingress which means that many more trying to obtain the badge by submitting new portals some people were submitting things like my dogs tail as a portal submission from my understanding theyre working on a way of reimplementing it i would not be surprised if pokestopportal submissions were put back in place by the time pokemongo is released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe they will place location vital points pokestops gyms etc in many places that had nearly nothing before the australian beta and probably the new us open field beta would point them to that direction and when it becomes available to everyone eventually i believe there will be a new influx of these locations in places where they can verify a difference in people interested and locations eg people in karachi pakistan in almost a days release in a place of ingress locations might mean work for niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it definitely would suck if they dont put any gymspokéstops in portal sparse areas while you wont be prevented from finding pokémon not having pokéstops to gear up would make it costly to play and even then youd be stuck simply collecting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hi again uyaxir there were a handful of portals in karachi when i visited hopefully niantic will take scarcity into account and make all of them into pokestopsgyms for you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they usually place the portals at unique public locations like a park sign and turtle ride at my park some reason no clue why and then about are bunched together at a public pool by my school so more than likely if you live near a park or something worthwhile itll become a pokemartportal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i checked karachi on the ingress intel map and there are plenty of portals you should be fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hello notanew one p i am an ingress player there are more than portals in karachi which our very limited community regular players have established all the pokestops in karachi are our portals although as you yourself has mentioned the snatching can be a huge problem fellow ingress players have lost their mobiles on multiple occasions i myself was once chased by a hiroof car in a secluded place i was on bike so i sped up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kids watched pokemon anime like crazy here and even collected the damn cards their sure as hell is a market d ill do my best to preach go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they just stopped accepting portal submissions so it wasnt just early ingress players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in karachi one of the busiest and bustling metropolises in the world so i guess im safe somewhat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all portals from ingress seem to have been converted to pokestops with gyms where there are two or more portals in a close area this isnt strictly true niantic only converted portals up to a certain density in chicago there are significantly fewer pokestops than portals all at a very regular intervals because we have a really high density of portals it sucks for me because i had two couch portals neither of which made the cut to pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no the portal submissions were disabled far before pokemon go was announced and garbage submissions apparently were a thing on its own for example i visited the capital of my country a year ago and there was a portal that was just a small pothole in the road it was categorized as art
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,kinda off topic but could you tell me how to submit portal applications in ingress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hiiii uthedesertvulpix thankyou for bringing this info up i never had an idea you played ingress here too p hopefully niantic will do something about this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what are the green and blue things
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,great d thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you cannot imagine how overjoyed and excited i am to hear this thankyou thankyou for your rather ingenious and extraordinary contribution solely because of your magnificent group of we are poised to have a proper gaming experience with pogo im sorry for the snatching incidents that happened to the ingress players but its part and parcel of playing in pakistan hell some players were robbed of their phones in holland as well you should really edit your flair like i have so that we finally have another representative on this sub im yet to find anyone else from karachi or even pakistan here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well thats nice to hear call it american cultural stupidly but i would easily believe pakistan to be one of those places were the local theocracy bans the very concept of pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they ran an event a few weeks ago looking for new portal submissions for a few days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh i havent been to check any of the local farms yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,found the link to what i was referencing limited portal submission event for tohoku japan from april to may niantic announced that it was suspending portal submissions on september thats less than one year ago httpsplusgooglecomniaopspostshfrzxjvjjdu pokemon go was announced september days later while i may have been incorrect at believing that the portal submissions were due to an influx of pokemon fans it was just something someone had mentioned to me earlier it may not be far from the truth with niantic recognizing the announcement of pokemongo would bring in a heck of a lot more ingress players and further flood the queue of portal submissions as niantic would have known about pokemongo well before it was released to the media all just speculation on my part im aware that it was backed up well before then too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,unfortunately at this time you cannot submit new portals
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the dots are portal locations they are different colors because the two teams blue and green have captured them the lines between them are links made in game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,portals green are owned by the green team blue by the blue team if i had zoomed in there might be some grey as well they are unclaimed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can prepare by playing ingress learn where portals are and how gps games work i can send you an invite its absolutely not needed but i would get points if you join via my invite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have edited my flair not mentioned city as i opt for not being so specific i have installed pogo yesterday and i think some other ingress player will also come here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol no its not that bad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really where
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokémon go is an upcoming augmentedreality game developed by niantic for ios and android devices the game will be released sometime in summer alongside the pokémon go plus a small wearable device developed by nintendo which uses a bluetooth connection to notify users when a pokémon is nearby with an led and a light rumble the game will allow players to capture battle train and trade virtual pokémon who appear throughout the real world the game will be freetoplay although it will support inapp purchases i am a bot please contact httpswwwredditcomusergregmartinez with any questions or feedback
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ca va mal thx
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ahaha d thanks for the supportive post bro but i dont have a personal smartphone atm so ill have to politely decline im going to buy one later on and by that time well hopefully have pgo in the open i want pgo to be a new and learning experience itself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well its your call but if youre not mentioning city cos of security reasons then theres nothing to worry about no ones gonna track you down from reddit info d also mentioning cities sort of increases awareness for people from west and us who may not have a vgood ideas about pakistans cities ps im not a new one btw p you can check my history i have been following this game for like the entire year or so
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a western person i feel like people often connect pakistan with afghanistan and such but from what ive seen on the internet i suppose there are many young pakistani people who like stuff like gaming anime etc so i guess its actually closer to turkey in terms of globalisation no idea tbh whenever we hear sth about pakistan on the news its something negative so im kinda curious
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this was only across the eastern coast of japan
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we got an email about it but it only ran for a couple of days im certain they were looking for more portals to support the pokemongo field testers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,done are you following pogo for one year or ingress whats your faction
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the news are always exaggerated while i admit all societies have their evils and such but many facts are highly exaggerated and displayed in a very magnified negative light than they should be there are matters tho where even i myself feel embarrassed since those matters humiliate us on a global stage but its all part and parcel of the current composition of the various mindsets present in the country i for one am all for globalisation and im an avid gamer turkey not quite there but were trying to get there there are alot of entrepreneurs with startups here and many global companies are making their entries in the local market as well im not one to typically distribute negative notions about other nations but the afghans have been asses from the beginning they tried to veto our entry in the un and have always treated us with hate even tho we always extended a hand of friendship towards them from what i learned in the foreign relations chapter in olevels and housed their refugees for humanitarian causes and inadvertently also paved way for many terrorists to enter pakistan and plague the society here hence the negative news you hearhowever we are completely different from afghanistan we havent been bombed to hell like them and most cities are modernized with a balanced tinge of our history architectural and cultural in the mix im sure youll love the historical sites and other tourist attractions i wholeheartedly invite you to visit karachi where the law and order is now better after the rangers took over the law enforcment matter or islamabad which is the capital if you want to sate your curiosity and see for yourself you can also ask uthedesertvulpix about karachi since hes been here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heard my name mentioned as a westerner whos spent time in karachi i can say with a fair bit of experience that the media in most europeannorth american countries tends to whitewash all of that area as being synonymous with backwards tribalism and a lack of globalismmodernization when in reality this is far from the case pakistani cities or at least the ones i saw during my stay are actually fairly modern certainly far and away moreso than most of the places i saw in afghanistan are they say on the same tier of technological advancement as the european capitals like berlin and paris well no but i have been in other countries that were far less sophisticated and accessible to the outside world at no point in my stay in pakistan did i feel like i had gone back in time or become cut off from the rest of the world despite what our media would tell you the vast majority of the people in pakistan at least in the cities i visited are outright friendly and helpful to tourists so long as you show respect to both them and the local customs there are areas of the country that it would be admittedly unsafe to wander through yes but there are a plethora of sites foreigners can safely visit that are of immense architectural and historical significance for not only pakistan but eastern civilization as a whole tldr is that i visited pakistan immediately following time spent in south africa and afghanistan and i will say unreservedly that pakistan was one of the highlights of my travels abroad does their government need a little work yes does the country as a whole face some potentially dangerous issues that they need to work through also yes but i think that can be said for nearly any region of the world as even the united states and germany and france have parts of their territory i would not feel safe entering without backup i would gladly visit pakistan again and wish only the best for the average joe citizens living there edit i feel it would be remiss to leave this out because it really highlights how pakistan doesnt quite suffer from the same instability as many of their neighbors they have a highly structured and trained armed forces mechanism that in my experience behaves every bit as professional as most of their european counterparts this is actually a rather rare and valuable quality among the sort of places ive typically visited
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,where
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im basically following pogo for a year now i heard about ingress before but that was a very short conversation on a gaming site of sorts so i never really got the hang of it also im studying computer so i was interested in noticing how were they using ar and geocaching to design pokemon for worldwide use i havent played ingress so no faction d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as far as i know everyone got one oo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think thats been mentioned a few times i think itd be great something you can play at home and sharpen your pokeball skills knowing niantic though id say dont hold your breath
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and are very clunky and sluggish i rolled back to which is very stable version however it crashed when i was examining a gym with red shiny gyarados i guess it doesnt get along with shiny textures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,didnt you hear the game has been renamed pokemon wait
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im on and havent noticed any particular issues
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you not spin pokestops use potions or put eggs in incubators all these interactions now take forever to complete
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,those things might take a bit longer than before but nothing particularly long
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is what is called a spawn you can find more info on it and other spawn types in this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,these types of spawns have been discovered i think what you have is a spawn meaning its the same pokemon its just hidden for the minutes between when it disappears and reappears on your map check out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish pokemon would spawn in my driveway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,had a vaporeon on a spawn once freaked out when it reappeared but couldnt see it because i already caught him p now i know what happened ty coincidentally caught a gyarados on an other spawn monday not very far from the vape spawn btw saw it reappear later but this time i didnt bother to go because i knew very well it was the same reappearing i didnt know about spawns but assumed it was a badly handled spawn or something like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bro the same thing happened to me yesterday i have a spawn point at my house and a rattata spawned with high cp i chose to ignore it because im low on pokeballs sure enough it never went away eventually i just captured it so it would go away today same thing but with a pidgey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,edit looks like this is wellknown already
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish i had a driveway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,look at you and your fancy home i live on the streets
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the whole world is your home
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at least you have streets i live in a cave
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at least you have a shelter i live in a swamp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,swamp i have insomnia
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got my two days back cant be a better choice of weapon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,h a m m e r b o i s
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice bike what is the yellow thing in the middle of the frame
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,isnt that a little too much gear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice youre much more prepared than i am
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will be getting a mount for my phone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i find playing on my bike much too difficult hahaha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know right that same one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a small net to catch bug pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty normal load for biking i mean most of the stuff on the ground is gonna be in his solar power backpack lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,meh its actually my normal daily gear so im cheating the solar backpack is awesome for my electronics and im all for renewable energy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would too but my area isnt really a good place to have that sort of thing out in the open do you happen to be in georgia us im from sc upstate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sticking with that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep you are correct this is my normal after this picture i put my sleeping bag and clothes on the rack and rode north to stay the night
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep land of the legendary spawns i hope
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hahaha that bastard got me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ha yeah right maybe in savannah or north in charleston if youre lucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cool someone else from ne ga what team are you joining
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im trying to decide between red and blue leaning towards blue im buford you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was thinking of joining yellow or maybe blue im like a hour and half north of you up in clayton
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,shhhh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic is exploring its inner slowpoke
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it should end sometime around now if its days long but tomorrow is the expected nest migration
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyve never been exact it is at their headquarters i am assuming itll happen soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it should have ended an hour ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i should have but they seem to be giving us a little extra time im not complaining at least it gave be a chance to finish my last lucky egg plus a few extra evolutions after that ran out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its random when you evolve an eevee it evolves into one of the original eeveelutions at random no way to influence it as of now im not in the beta but this has been asked and answered probably times p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have to pray to rngesus tt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw this one post of a guy that had a complete eevolution by catching a jolteon so it seems evolved eevees also walk around
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks i havent seen any info on it on tsr thats why i asked
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught houdours in one place but no nest it was weird
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this doesnt really seem out of the ordinary youre encountering uncommon pokemon at a rate that seems appropriate
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exactly the same spawns around my house but i noticed a decrease in diversity saw a hoppipchikorita etc in the evening sometimes but they are all gone i think yiure lucky so enjoy it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,never really get in a day though i realize how sad that sounds maybe its just me getting used to no water event though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you have programming experience
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hate to be that guy but im going to use this opportunity to get on my soap box this process of extracting information about upcoming releases from game apks is not data mining a better term would probably be apk mining data mining involves sifting through vast amount of data thats collected from recording various realworld actions for example to truly data mine the catch rate of a dragonite you would query niantics theoretical database of millions of catch attempts by thousands of users to determine how many throws were made and how many successful catches occurred note the difference here from inspecting the games code to simply find the exact percentage value in a config file data mining is based on data not code hence the name and because of this it usually involves looking for patterns in user behaviors because there is no way to just pull the exact values from the config files of human beings the activity commonly referred to as data mining here on tsr is really just unpacking an apk container and viewing its contents this can involve looking at image files sound clips and textbased configuration files sometimes it may involve decompiling binaries into humanreadable code but it is essentially just digging through the files niantic sends us to see what can be gleaned and whats different than last time its still a very useful thing to do as it can give us insight into upcoming changes but it is an improper use of the term data mine general description of the term httpsenwikipediaorgwikidatamining and heres some info on how actual data mining can be used with respect to games httpwwwgameanalyticscombloggamedataminingfundamentalshtml google searching about data mining games seem to be about related to pokemon go but its clear that this incorrect usage did not start with pogo somewhere along the line the gaming community started using the term wrong and it slowly picked up steam but i believe that if we all get on the same page we can stem this tide of improper terminology end rant
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seconds of googling how to datamine an apk should be pretty similar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tried that on different apps and i still didnt get the right java code
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not great at coding but since youre working with a net binary would you even be able to read it in java did you try the program recommended in the link
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nevermind i think is what youre looking for anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,although i see plenty of wild pokémon my pokedex is almost blank seeing them on the map is not enough to show in your pokedex you have to engage them if you just want them in your pokedex but dont want to catch them you can just engage and then run away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looks like your explanation is correct sure i wont engage unless pocket
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or view them in a gym by clicking on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,of course thats already mentioned in ops post with the interesting mention that it happens even if you cant view the gym due to lvl or i assume no team selected
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what i havent yet determined is whether i see the top and bottom mon only or all of them edit all mons are added to seen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just went through an area milliken state park ne of downtown detroit that became a squirtle nest in the last migration i saw squirtles charmander and bulbasaur so the nest is still a nest with extras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i went to the nest again and it was well populated now must have been a fluke or bad timing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol they definitely didnt replace commons with starters im still seeing almost exclusively pidgey and rattata
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey neighbor drake sportspark in west bloomfield is also a squirtle nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am talking about the starter nests have you visited one since the event started your comment is the usual internet lol without really providing any useful information not sure why i bother to post on reddit anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nests dont spawn the nest pokémon at all times sometimes you will see five at once and other times you wont see any
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a charmander nest behaving as a charmander nest so no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes charmander nest is still charmander
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hes replying to your last comment in your op about niantic changes the commons to the starters which they definitely didnt do they arent that common my squirtle nest fyi is still producing plenty of squirtle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it could be random
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive not heard any other reports of this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,please dont post multiple toplevel posts with information the community has already seen thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its being reported a lot here its not just disconnecting the app is actually crashing in the background restarting shows the splash screen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have the go and ios with the latest version of pokemon go and my go is working just fine your symptoms of it disconnecting after every catch sounds to me like a dead battery i have had the same identical thing happen to me in the past with the go and changing the battery fixed it instantly edit my son has a go and is using the latest version on android without any issues
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,problem is still here poke stops are okay but catching is a nono i wont be able to replace battery today unfortunately but ill try it tomorrow its weird that it can wibrate for few hours but disconnect on catch without the icon that battery needs to be replaced like the last time it was gone first worked for months this i replaced month ago so its even more weird of the battery is a problem
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this issue has happened to me in the past when pogo disconnects after capture attempts it was an issue with the battery try taking out the battery and putting it back in to see if that resolves the issue if that doesnt work use a new battery if it still disconnects after a new battery let us know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,android with same issue app just crashes like almost instantly when i push it to background reverted to and works fine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,change your battery i had the very same problem and it worked
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had the same problem a while ago it also started after an update so i blamed the update in the end after replacing the battery the second time it never happened again its still weird because ive always suspected it being a software problem it would vibrate for half an hour notifying me of nearby pokemon but once i tried to catch something it immediately disconnected so the battery was charged enough to vibrate for an hour but once i clicked once its not charged enough to complete that action doesnt sound logic to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ios and plus are working fine the battery drain this app is causing is unreal though it seems like it just keeps getting worse and worse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine closes on a catch attempt as well though not connected to the go apple watch instead
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,using android this has been happening since gen i thought the update would fix no luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had the same problem the day before yesterday where as soon as i pressed the button it disconnected however when i tried the next day it was fine this was before even downloading the update have only done so this morning so try turning off bluetooth restarting phone etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i can confirm since this update app crashes a ton in background
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think that the battery is a problem here for a number of reasons a it happened just immediately after last update b pokemon go plus can stay connected for long time blink with every poke stop and pokemon and then crash only when i attempt to catch c ive replaced battery recently d last time there was indicator that the battery is gonna pass out and now there isnt one e pokemon go is buggy and crashes without pokemon go plus too thanks for the input though im somewhat happy that you dont have similar problem and worried that this bug is affecting only me and there will be no solution still ill try new battery in two days when ill get home
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this happened to me as well that battery does not last as long as you would think
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont trust the battery low indicator mine came on then went back off a couple days later and i got almost another weeks out of the battery when my last battery died the low battery indicator never even came on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same issue here i replaced the battery
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,had the same issue new battery fixed it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this likely wont affect visa requirements for at least a year i think well cross this bridge when we come to it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tbh completely honest for us brits it shouldnt affect us too much any time soon in this day and age the changes will likely happen slowly and almost unnoticeable for most this will be not just in our best interests but the governments best interests too for a smoother transition cameron is still around til october so we should start seeing some of the more subtle changes around that time until stuff starts actually changing im guessing things here will be business as usual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we got years of time to go to europe and do all the trading we can so its best to just go with it until it rises i think mobile data could be a problem i guess it is best to look forward and keep moving
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still i think it would be a good idea to discuss options early alternate routes to go through people pooling money together in order for those who will be participating in exporting pokemon from the uk to other countries to have an easier time obviously the money doesnt have to be sent right away but i think it would be an idea to discuss our options for different scenarios brexit could also cause others to leave the eu depending on whether or not it goes well its always good to prepare imo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awh man donthe ruin it for me by reminding me of a big prat like cameron this is the pokemon universe now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you want to prepare get a credit now then buy gold and food rations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lolz i was just saying changes will happen when he leaves but if you insist who will you vote for as our next prime minister helix or magikarp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im probably just blooming stupid but what do you mean by get a credit what kind of credit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah of course in pound or euro
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you mean move to america in all honesty it would probably be easier to immigrate to the republic of ireland or scotland if it leaves the uk and rejoins the eu or do you mean invest in the american stock markets theres a problem with that im flat broke
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that would be a different strategy entirely get the credit in pound or euro buy gold and rations with it when it still has value after some time pay back the credit with some of the gold you bought the money will have lost value also the gold but not that bad im just messing with you btw no need to act like doomsday is about to break on at the moment you dont know what to prepare for wait two years and see again when the gun powder smoke has settled
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know im just discussing worst case scenarios though to be fair the worst case scenario is really a british sengoku jidai with people rioting about whether or not to stay in or leave the eu and genuinely warring against each other and if that happens im joining in because i probably have a few problems
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as you said one of the worst case scenarios would be scotland and n ireland leaving the uk as for the borders to your new european neighbours there might actually be free roaming because ironically in order to get a new trade agreement with the eu the uk wouldve to accept a whole bunch of rules set by the eu and this one might be included so dont worry too much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get the feeling theres two ways its gonna be split northern ireland and scotland are going to stay together creating north britain and england and wales will stick together creating south britain north britain and south britain rather than great britain that would make for some awesome flags tbh like the union jack with only the diagonals and then st georges cross with the welsh dragon over it the other option is that northern ireland joins the republic of ireland scotland leaves and england and wales stick together still a cool flag for me however not sure what wed call ourselves at that point im not worried in the slightest were britain weve had worse and weve trudged through it until weve managed to fix it we can get through this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are concerned with sr trade routes but dont worry for britain in the slightest i think you try to convince yourself of something here there is no need to pretend the situation went from concerning to st in a split second we should leave it at that politics dont fit in this sub
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i meant it will probably be st but well get through the st eventually sr is an international thing if it were just something in britain it would be fine however things are going to change and plans may also have to be made and changed accordingly and i will agree with you on politics not fitting in this sub thing the intention of this thread was specifically to allow us to changemake plans if need be
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,jop the auto mod may or may not have assassinated my last comment im just too tired to check outside of the app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can still see it it deleted mine though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow thats awesome i always avoid ar because of low ram ill give it a shot next time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats interesting i have a lot of lag in battles and i wonder if it would help worth experimenting with i suppose
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i found that catching all pokemon at the bottom of the gym and loading least number of pokemon helps a lot so when i restart game to battle the gym i dont even load the nearby tab and for attacking if the matchup is decent i just go with it now this gives me more edge except that i need to concentrate harder or i get hit by the charge move
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they really need to fix that gym error bug gps drifted out of a gym times today and each locked me out for minutes thats just absurd it should be a pretty simple fix probably doesnt even need a client update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope but then again i have a recent phone and good signal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,localbased anything is more prone to hacking abuse constant messaging to the servers is to prevent this basically the game will send a message to the server and the server might send some info back the messages currently are more like use this move at x time etc it forces all the processing onto the server lets say you moved that data onto the phone and you only report the damage dealt to pokemon if someone figures out what this message looks like they could just keep sending dealt damage messages until the enemy is dead even worse it could be set up to just report the results of a battle who won and how much life remains for the victor if you could fake that message then you could instantly obliterate any gym ive seen many patches that improved things such as how pokemon hp fixes itself if the game doesnt register your dodge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hmm do you restart the app before you get involved in gyms im afraid i havent experienced the issues you are describing if i do get the nasty red error i use a different pokemon to avoid the one still thought to be in the gym or come back later but given the current versions memory leak i also restart the app after battling too long but ive spent hours battling gyms on the new version without what you describe happening condolences though that sucks ps see the recent article about googles datacenter being used for pokemon go its unlikely issues at googles end at this point heh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lag problems have gotten worse since the most recent update i dont have gps interference unless i am inside a concrete building or an overpass and its not that wide of an area that my character runs it do sent matter what kind of phone you have the app should still function yes gps might be bad but the rest of the game should be fine the problem is the memory leak issue compounding data means that eventually the strain of the app would be too much for even the high end phones that including all the variables in people experiences means that play is varied for everyone no matter what their device is some are more prone to certain issues then others but overall if the game functions it should improve not worsen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this only affect lowend phones because of cheap gps chip used in them i almost never encounter this issue if you a playing heavily gps related game with bad gps phone of course you will encounter many problems
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive never found the point of gyms its mostly a bragging contest with no real reward
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a nonprogrammer its pretty hard to tell how simple a fix is often things are way way more complicated that you might think but yes in general the only thing they need to do is to give us another meter leash after initiating the gym battle this means you need to be within interaction range at the start and till you press the gobutton but after that you get additional meters before you get kicked out drifting or meters is quite usual at some gym positions especially those who are very obstructed heck we have gyms under a highway bridge you cant capture them from the highway obviously but from under the bride where a small road goes you have terrible gps and gyms right in front of old bunkers that are like meters tall and full of lead and concrete so no chance for any gps signal to come through from that direction or churches who often do the same since you dont get a signal from one direction you often drift away from the building yeah thanks a mere meters of additional leash would solve this problem and wouldnt really be abusable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not true its heavily impacted by your surroundings when i play in my neighborhood i have no problems but at work when im surrounded by skyscrapers its really inconsistent on the plus side some days i can get a good number of kms just sitting at my desk so its got some benefits still i get really annoyed when i get locked out of gyms on my lunch break cause i dont have min to spare so ill trade the free kms for a better system
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,low end phones arent susceptible to gps in the way your describing this is only relevant in terms of signal strength and only obstacles would distort your location in those instances as ive said before its not gps thats the problem otherwise i would be having more problems then just gyms alone the only places where having a high end phone matter for pokemon go is in terms of processing power and the fact that with the memory leak issure high end phones can last longer but not indefinitely there is a point where a highend phone will crash its just easier to reach it with a lowend phone regardless of how good your phone is my point still stands if you can play the game currently you should be able to play in minutes time not having to worry if your phone has enough ram to complete gyms battles and not just half of one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,funny how my low end phone has absolutely no gps problems in google maps or gps status but constantly malfunctions with go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont consider coins and stardust as a real reward not everyone spends money on the game and who couldnt use more stardust
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been collecting coins a day since august at first i woke up at in the morning to collect coins while everyone else was asleep but now im established in a bunch of lv gyms i have an item inventory of that allows me to stock great balls max revives and max potions at all times a pokémon inventory of that allows me to have many different varieties of pokémon and oodles of incubators and lucky eggs for me thats also rewarding
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think free pokecoins for upgrades lures and incubators is actually quite useful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not a programmer but i am an it consultant so ive got a decent idea of whats involved your leash idea would probably help a ton aside from that some type of connection is still made to the gym and thats whats giving the error until it times out the solution to that would be if a connection exists when a client wants to make a new one kill the old i dont see how that would be abusable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,instead of a leash i would use a longer timer before a character is kicked out sometimes my character will travel a long unreal distance but only for maybe seconds max before being whipped back to my real location if a character drifts away from the gym and then drifts back within a second span i would allow that character to continue battling
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,go uses the phones gps so if your gps signal is weak it will continue to be weak
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the other answers are correct but i have noticed that if you rely on app going from background to foreground to generate extra drift the plus obviously eliminates this since the app gps never completely goes into background mode while the plus is connected
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,go doesnt contain any gps as zzmmrmn said
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so i should experience no change then thanks ill be able to save my phones battery during the day more hopefully
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,useful info i dont necessarily rely on it but sometimes do this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i find that this really reduces drift for me that location services is running the whole time gives it a great shot at being really accurate most drift for me is when in a large office building
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep works wonderfully with gps drift only thing to note is that my go disconnects after exactly hour so you gotta repair once an hour
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes absolutely revives seem to be back up slightly ultras and razz down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try spinning in the other direction
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,see i tried to make a post about this alot of people do asking if this or that has changed and it seems theyre promptly always shot down folks say its all random just rngesus etc and honestly maybe it is maybe its not to find out it takes genuine hard work and for it to really be credible and reliable it takes alot of hard work from alot of people and thats well hard its alot to ask of folks and theres really nothing for them to gain aside from a little kudos from the community when theyre given credit in a thread from the execs im personally not really willing or able to do that type of rigorous data collection not many are and its understandable atleast to me so until more people are willing to organize these types of data collections and then find volunteers to collect said data we really wont definitively know any of these things what i proposed was that were not seeing dramatic change to drop rates all at once but that its possible niantic has learned that we notice these dramatic changes and we do comprehensive study when these dramatic changes occur and so instead they may be making minute changes gradually adjusting drop rates by a few percent every few weeks if they do that its very easy to slip changes past us my analogy is a child growing up if you see them daily you dont see the change but if you see them once a month it blows you away more on topic im a hoarder i like to have a deep stock of good stuff and a very disposable amount of lesser items bag space maxed i built my collection up to the point that i only use regular revives and any pots aside from max when im actively out battling and looting stops battle a gym use up my junk stock run a restock loop battle repeat and when im finished battling ill restock until ive thrown away everything except max revs and max pots i used to hover around max pots max revs im actually battling alot less but only looting slightly less and max pots stay around its not a big deal im well stocked for battle the real thing that ive noticed is with balls i always kept ultras over with ease never had to try once i got it up to i had no problem maintaining id never focus on a set number its just where things settled at at the same time my great balls were usually around i use them mote and theyre fairly disposable to me in the past weeks or so ive noticed others online not on tsr and players in person talking about the lack of ultras i too had been noticing it but never said anything in the past weeks ive made a very concerted effort to build up my stock of ultras to no avail great ball a plenty its no problem at all fir me to amass greats but im aiming to amass ultras and they just arent dropping im almost never using any in hopes of gaining more no luck im not a data collector im just no good at it so i have no hard evidence no proof whatsoever but my observation and others seems to agree is that ultra drop rate is being replaced with great balls im not sure where berries fall in the mix sometimes i get plenty other times very few rng i guess right i really dont know i do know that my play style has not changed in way that would cause me to use more ultras im very sure of that it is possible that im actually just not looting the number of stops i used to but judging by the numbers that are quite clearly displayed in my medals section my looting hasnt changed either and yet here i sit struggling to get my ultras up to when i used to have no issue maintaining at the sane time great balls build up more and more and so i use them more and more id love to see a real comprehensive breakdown of drop rates of each and every item from stops but again its a tall order and one im not up for and so i really cant complain ill just keep spinning and catching
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im swimming in a pool of berries very very recently like an hour ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its just random mate sorry
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree with this usually theyre so common that i just delete any over once the starter event was announced i decided to keep everyone i received but havent been able to get over despite spinning about pokestops on the and could be bad luck but isnt a lot when spinning that many stops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,while hopping on one foot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and rubbing your belly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i rename mine for the move type so i can easily tell which cloister is the one with the ice moves vs the water moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the pokemon name never appears without the image since you can always deduce the type from the image there is no need to include the type in the name juvies get named with their appraisal if they arent getting sent directly to the professor ill delete enough of their original name to code the appraisal and if it was hatched from an egg fighters get a name beginning with the move class and an extension for the charge move if it isnt bar this may be followed by the appraisal or anything else that i might use when it comes time to thin the herd all of the buddies ive walked with are currently named bud since the game is tracking individual walking distance for each buddy i figure it might be important in the future and therefore i probably want to hold on to them the top defenders get a personal name beginning with a space
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do the iv followed by moveset types and an asterisk at the end if its their best charge move so my blastoise with bitehydropump is named darwat if its a pokémon im going to prestige to death before i transfer it i just name it and then sort by name during battle selections sometimes ill add the moveset as well for the higher stuff like icefai for a cp jynx i dont want i just finished my last lucky egg for a while and have about pidgeottos named that im waiting to throw at gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my naming convention is actually quite similar since i essentially delete anything that doesnt have either the best attacking or defending moveset i use for best defense moves and for best attack moves ie vap snor venu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i name mine e for evolve for any pokemon that ill evolve after it dies in a gym battle for example all high cp pidgey and most eevee note that evolving completely heals a pokemon j for junk for any pokemon that ill transfer after it dies in a gym battle note that the professor is just as happy to make candy from a dead pokemon as a live one the names of the rest dont really matter so cute names are fine i put the first so they show up first in my list when i choose things to use in gym battles its important that they all have the same name e or j so within those groups theyre sorted by cp that way when i want to do a gym battle i first skim to the right cp range of my e pokemon and use one if i can if not i skim to the right cp range of my j pokemon and use one of those if i can each of those are ideal because theyre options if i cant find enough expendable pokemon in the right cp range i sort by cp and the name no longer matters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok so mine is initials of moveset then iv i know the names of all gen pokes a water gun hydro pump vaporeon with iv would be called wghp no quotes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i go with iv values in hex primary and secondary move and iv percentage example my favorite defender vaporeon is fef wghp non hex speakers thats why dont i leave the name in there cause i can tell that a vaporeon is a vaporeon by the sprite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i try to go the comedy route my vaporeons are named things like wegetituvape vapenation or blowinclouds i have some named after the rosters as well its my usual battle team so i could find them easier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,use the symbol at the beginning then you can sort out your attacker and defender easily
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hi sorry for the noobness but how do you know the exact ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i too use hex for iv if it has stab moveset i add € to the name if its the best moveset it gets a i include moveset type if its not stab hatched pokemon get a ☆ for attackers ♤ for defenders ♢ for both offense defense ●is added if iv vapeoreon lvl type water iv hatched watergunhydropump both moves are also water types my name in the game would be €♢ i think i covered it all oh and i use the favorites star in the game to signify which pokemon to evolve that way i can just sort by favorites when i get ready to mass evolve once i add their new moveset info to the evolved pokemons nsme i remove the favorotes star
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this may help not sure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i turn sound off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on android you can use any sound app you can startstop from pulling down the notification tray at the top to override pokemon go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i saw that when it was posted in silph last week unfortunately i dont have that settings set up on my phone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it still turns off my music though even without actual sound coming from go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah but i didnt need to do that in the first place weeks ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah but its not weeks ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you very helpful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre welcome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i completed all the medals prior to gen and now have johto and dark since i havent seen or heard of anyone seeingcatching one of these anywhere near me im bummed that there is a medal i probably wont be able to obtain at least i can live in a pretend world where i have all the medals until that first one shows up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you just jump up to the next trainer level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you likely just reached one of the trainer levels that gives rewards
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,similar thing happened to me earlierin between catching a squirtle and charmander i got about ultra balls out of nowhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah so strange i thought i had managed to buy coins somehow haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no i am mid and girlfriend is mid also that would have been ultrballs its so strange
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no we are both mid and its so strange
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,report it to niantic several users have posted gyms which they are also unable to interact with
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i reported four times unanswered by niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then youve done all that you can though i would continue to report it no one here can do anything about it if thats what youre asking for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youre in a place where you catch zubats constantly cincinnati represent then this is actually pretty effective with all the golbats you end up lucky eggvolving i kid you not i have literally golbats right now thing is you get them less frequently
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just tried this out yes it took me all pidgeottos to beat that arcanine but the gym lost prestige and i gained xp without spending any items then i transferred them and collected pidgey candies like i was going to anyway then i queued up my next pidgeottos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this was posted a day or so ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have come to call this pidgey warfare with my friends started to do it about two weeks ago the first time i did a mass evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,justice rains from above
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when humans became too expensive for human wave attacks we started using pidgeys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive tried this from time to time throwing pigeottos raticates and dodrios there was a nestkinda on a popular lure spot among other things at gyms i no longer do it cause of the time it takes there are different types of efficiency with the game this is very efficient at utilizing extra pokemon instead of items but if you have some amount of decent pokestop farming areas sometime you have too many revives like i do so it becomes whether to use trash pokemon or use trash items to take down gyms and how much time do i want to spend on that versus trying to catch more monsgain experiencehatch eggsget items its also pretty slow exp for me compared to just farming lure spots to each their own though you get my upvote since it is a good piece of info for those unaware its a fine way to conserve healing items if needed i can imagine people with highly contested gyms nearby doing this as a way to survive the endurance battle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,psa dont sacrifice your candy evolutions blindly beedrill is a monster youll never defend a gym with one but they are so quick that they can take down much stronger pokemon with ease if you get a good one use it the same goes with butterfree both are very good at getting hypnos down in gyms i also am a big fan of venomoth but as a first line of defense pokemon in highlevel gyms it makes people change up their team of if the first thing they fight is a venomoth finally pidgeys are great if you get the steeldragon attacks youre set i very much disagree with the people who are stab advocates its far more important to have attacks that are rare than stab if you can have a pokemon with one type and attacks of a different type you essentially have no weakness unless youre stupid enough to attack an electabuzz with a pidgey i cringe when i get stab pokemon and i could have had alternate attacks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel like an idiot for not realizing this any sooner thanks for pointing it out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i normally transfer off the evolve screen to save time and effort also lets me evolve usually at least high iv pidgeot but this i like this ill have to add it to my grind rotation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like the idea and also do this in a way myself living in the suburbs means there are a a lot of pidgeys and zubats very few rarestrong pokemons and very few pokestop so because of that i only have a few really good pokemons it only takes a few gym battles for me to run out of potions and revives so i have started using some pidgeotto to start out and then have my last or be my big guns this might seen silly but i figure this way i can gain gym battle experience figure out the mechanics and probably get a gym or two without wasting precious and rare resources i wont of course continue to do this when i have more strong pokemons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,title translation hey niantic look youve got to fix this next
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,raticates work well for gym mobbing too especially with the hyperbeam secondary that hits for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a guy that doesnt takeover gyms is mass evolving a good strategy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is how the orcs fightor zerg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can someone please explain why the mass evolving is part of this strategy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how do you pick more than one i only am able to get one pokemon to attack or train a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just did a mass evolution under a lucky egg only got per evolution i think niantic cut out this loophole with the new update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and those things bite the hell out of hypnos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that sounds incredibly time inefficient honestly you can do this or just use regular dudes and take out more than the arcanine much quicker and then continue on your way hitting stops for the items you used
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so instead of zerg you send burd ill show myself out on topic interesting idea especially if the front defender is just a pain or you wanna chip away at the roster size
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its much better to keep them for prestiging your own gym put in a pinsir and use a pidgeotto to attack it you will gain prestige instead of because its half the cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,then i queued up my next pidgeottos ok i feel like the biggest idiot in the world right now but how do you queue specific pokemon for battles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly i get so many revives and potions from poke stops im dumping them constantly to make room for poke balls and i usually wipe a few gyms a day your better off just using good pokemon and potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did a search but i guess it wasnt good enough here i thought i was contributing something new
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we knew this within the first few days of the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,woah is that how its said in full ive only ever heard half of it at any given time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its far more important to have attacks that are rare than stab i strongly disagree especially with this specific example wing attack is already slightly stronger than steel wing plus it gets a multipler with stab while steel wing has no stab and a multiplier against fire water and electric aka every eeveeloution and all of the most common pokemon outside of bugs who are weak against flying and thus effectively have a multiplier because they miss out on the super effective boost everyone will throw their jolteon against a pidgey so if youre going to be using a not very effective attack you may as well be using the stronger attack that also gives stab wing attack is superior to steel wing against everything but rock types of which i havent even seen one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting got a perfect level kakuna off on egg that i evolved into a bug bitesludge bomb one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely saves time to do it that way but i didnt because it spends lucky egg time adding up all those seconds might get me one more evolution in minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,take down a gym w a buddy and put a couple highish cp pincers on the gym spam lower cp pidgeottos at it for a bit for the best results
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because you just evolved the pidgeys into them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,use a lucky egg xp for the next half hour evolve as many pidgeysweedlecaterpies as you can do note that if you transfer them right after evolving you get candy per pidgeotto while if you use this strategy you get less candy which in the long run also has an effect as a city player i have enough acces to items so i dont see the benefit but maybe if you dont have an easy acces to stops that this is indeed a valid strategy edit english flenglish mistakes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you are attacking a gym belonging to your own team you only get one but you get when you attack a gym belonging to another team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been evolving with a lucky egg for so long that i am sure it was per evolution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and those things bite the hell out of hypnos but golbats also take extra damage from psychic attacks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,strongly agree in the time it takes for you to beat a gym with pidgeottos i couldve biked half a block and collected pokestops giving me more than enough potions to take out the gym normally for a lot of suburban players the limiting factor to increasing exp is pokeballs not potions why would you defeat gyms anyway except to collect coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,people always fail to put any value on their own time with things like this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,berd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so instinct protoss
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,some might judge but to me this is a learning experience for everyone when you go to a gym and battle the game will autoselect pokemon for you lets say it picks one of your weaker ones just tap on that pokemon and the game pulls up your pokemon inventory and whichever one you pick will take over the spot of that pokemon you selected note if you select a pokemon to replace and the one you choose to replace it with is already in your starting they will just swap places in the queue hope that helps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you did that post only talks about them having hp youre saying even fainted works
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you get an e for effort
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its alright bud
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why did you think a screenshot would make this more useful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah lol mass pidgeocide came right after mass evolution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive got a pinser at that i use with a stack of pidgeots with wing attack to grind my gym up about prestige per win and goes quickly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre saying mint condition pigeottos return more candy than used ones or do you get extra candy if you transfer them as soon as the screen pops after the evolution animation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah thanks great idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,standard is xp per evolution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why would you defeat gyms anyway except to collect coins gyms can give relatively good exp for the time spent but not when youre using pidgeotto i like to do a battle or two when i pass an opposing gym usually because it equates to catching a few pokemon worth of exp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,both are limiting pokeballs are in short supply because pokestops are in short supply pokestops being in short supply means items that you get from pokestops are in short supply i can hit a few pokestops near me take down a gym using mostlyall pidgeys and by then i can i can hit the same pokestops again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think it depends where you are playing as a city player myself ive been tossing out potions daily since release as there is never a shortage of stops gyms are by far the slowest exp for me and only useful once every hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see the stance of gyms only being useful for coins quite often on here but not everyone cares about being efficient my wife and i play casually in between jobs and kids and we are still about to ding level without any kind of efficient training or lucky egg use ive saved all mine so far we also like to get in the competitive spirit though because there are gyms within blocks of our house so we think of them as our gyms and we go grind them down anytime we are nearby i actually like this idea of being able to knock some prestige off those pesky instinct players that keep putting way bigger pokemon in our gyms without having to use our potions and revives up faster
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when i hear stuff like this im glad i live in the city i dont know how you suburbanites do it i am sitting on pokeballs great balls and ultra balls after my walk through central park yesterday on the flip side gym battling is pointless bc you lose them within a few hours at least deleting all my potions makes room for more balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you start analyzing entertainment by quantifying the value of your time youll quickly realize that youre better off hiring someone else to farm pidgeys for you at minimum wage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or the value of their time is very little or indeed offset by the benefits of being outside exercising what else would you be doing on a warm sunny day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sorry whats the word
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks so much i always assumed that the game autoselected your best six pokemon until yesterday when i went to a gym and the game placed my parasect as first against a flareon at that over several other of my pokemon and for the life of me i couldnt figure out how to swap it out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i didnt i thought a screenshot made it more funny
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,apparently not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think this is true you can still get candies per pidgeotto you just use them once before transferring
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,taking down a pokemon gym will take at least to minutes assuming equal levels if i recall correctly each pokemon defeated nets in that timespan you can probably walk through pokestops catch a couple weak pokemon and save up candies for a lucky egg evolve to compound the problem most gyms are in the cp range for pokemon making it excruciatingly difficult to grind on gyms for low level players the opportunity cost is just not worth it its a good way of getting exp but not the most optimal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokeballs are in short supply because pokestops are in short supply you should live in a city i throw away balls potions and revives all the time edit i really didnt think i needed to add the s but apparently people think im honestly suggesting completely changing a lifestyle in order to better a better pokémon experience
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sure but i never go farm pidgeys and not sure why anyone else would either i enjoy the game wandering around collecting all sorts of stuff ill grab those pidgeys on my way but im not gonna just sit and farm them somewhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,still playing pokemon but not sitting in one spot grinding a gym with crap
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,which it did xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,keep the more funny low quality content to rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,once you get in the rotation you still net the same amount of candies you just get the candies from pidgeotto before you pop the lucky egg instead of after it actually saves a couple clicks in the mass evolve spam and you can get a few more evolves out of it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its more relevant for xp purposes when youre high level and you can just blow through everything with cp pokemon if a level gym gives you and you blow through it once in minutes sec each pokemon thats a rate of xphr whereas if youfor examplewalk through two pokestops catch a pidgey and a rattata in those three minutes thats a little bit less or xphr from pokestops from catching even including xp gained from evolving them later w lucky eggabout evolution experience for each pidgey you catch and for each rattata on average of course these are numbers i picked pretty arbitrarily and theyll vary but as you can see the faster you can take out a high level gym the more it makes sense to do so for xp purposes you might not exactly be able to grind on them but if youre passing by i think it can make sense to take a gym down for xp even if youre not looking for the defender bonus footnote if anyones confused about those numbers i used for evo exp its because it takes on average pidgeys to get enough candy to evolve one because you start with two candies from the previous evolutionone from the evo itself and one from transferring the evolved pokemon then you get three more from capturing a pidgey to evolve then you need more candies from capturing more pidgeys and transferring so thats pidgeys total then you get xp from evolving evolution xp per pidgey similar math for rattata
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it depends on your level i used to hit the item limit frequently before level but in the levels past im feeling steadily more strained for items especially pokéballs potions and revives arent that much of an issue unless i coinfarm every day out of curiosity what constitutes a town and a city in this context id consider where i live to be a small town about people in whats considered the actual town in the municipality and theres plenty of stops in the city center
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but this whole comment thread is complaining about someones inefficient way of gaining xp the optimum way of gaining xp is farming pidgey if youre concerned about the value of your own time the optimal strategy is to hire someone else to jog or bike around in neighborhoods with many pidgeys farming them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just stop while youre down nobody likes a hater
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in a million person city and there are stops between my house and my train station then i have stops at all the stations all the way to work going to work i get stops or so so yeah doing nothing i get over points a day just from stops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well the problem i hve with such reports is that i am simply not sure those were really from the same spawn point if it is a hightraffic area there likely are a lot of spawn points next to each other how can you distinguish which one spawned that rare pokémon and naturally if there are many spawn points there then rare pokémon are proportionally more likely to be found there and that may be the reason why you see many rares on the tracker in that location
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im curious to know if there is a pokestop there i have one in town that spawns uncommon but not rare and my friend found another that spawns all kinds of crazy things like what you mention its a great one to lure and weve gotten all sorts of interesting pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i started a personal study on my city just to find out uncommon spawns some uses mapstracker even without the connection with your pogo account but using them you can track the typical area where it more reliable having a good spawn just the spot you have found looks really interesting if there is a pokestop near you could have a breed with a lure module and hope for something tldr you can map the best spawns by yourself and your study or you can use trackermaps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in madrid spain theres a spawn like that near the river its not a high traffic area but everyday we get around very rare spawns there its the place you want to go to get dratinis and larvitars ive also caught meganium and typhlosion there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah ive got one specific one in my building like that every time a third tier evolution or outofbiome mon shows up on nearby i immediately know to walk to the fire escape on that side of the complex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what gen pokemon spawn here i live near a biome that spawns similar to what you mentioned its a mount moon biome and im pretty sure ive caught larvitar kabutops dragonite snorlax at the same spawn point a lapras also spawned at this point during the event im assuming it was only because of the event but im hoping it will spawn here again sometimes because seel shellder and other waterice types spawn nearby too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here we dont have so much spawn points and it is absolutely possible to distinguish the spawn points that spawn uncommon monsters i always see one of these on my nearby list while sitting at home and as far as i remember it has spawned lapras onix shuckle for the last migrations now it spawns bulbasaur
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont get the problems you are presenting so you cant be sure which exact point is spawning because they are so close so whats the issue anyway since you will catch them all the same in that spot neither do i know many spawns that cant be distinguished in the map
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is not one spawn point it is a couple of spawn points along the dike not at all in the city centre the thing is i can run for an hour of and not see any uncommon pokemon at all in my city everytime i spend a few minutes along that dike i find uncommon pokemon unfortantely we do not have a scanner in my city as far as i know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the post office one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know a lot of points next to each other there are many maps online that will show all spawn points after a while and many spots especially hightraffic ones like areas in the city center are just full of spawn points my point is i live close to a pokéstop that has such a cluster of spawn points within its reach so my nearby always shows me some pokémon next to that stop and because there are so many sometimes of course there are some that are relatively rare here i caught my only shuckle there went out many times to get a rhyhornchansey saw my first hitmontop there but it doesnt mean that any of the spawn points there spawns on average more rare pokémon than usual there just are more spawns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep i also noticed that pattern there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,send these questions to the discord researchers channel friend most users on the subreddit dont have access to the silph app yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good to know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,quick catch is gone when the pokemon begins to load you throw your pokeball which would often result in a catch and also often resulting in an excellent great or nice catch throw no more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,soon we will have for now you could try to create a chat room in some messaging app and share it through the atlas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres two options i know of for reddit specifically first you can copy their username from the atlas onto reddit and see if they made an account with the same name the atlas gives you the option to make a different display name so this doesnt always turn up anything and then you could send them a pm saying hi secondly theres probably a tsr sub for your area httpswwwredditcomrthesilphroadwikiregions ive heard recommendations for discord snapchat and facebook before so you might want to check those out too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,look up their names here on reddit they have to at least have a reddit account to be able to report nests and write them directly or wait until the big update for tsrtsratlas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,even if some way to do this existed i think many would opt out in order to keep anonymity
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when you report the nest leave a contact email throwaway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the atlas gives you the option to make a different display name so this doesnt always turn up anything hard to pm a page
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how can you change your display name
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when you first sign up it asks what you want to be known as
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,smart ideainitial reports seem to be coming from lvl and up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think there is a small hole for you to add it to a string for a necklace
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know there is i just want to know how others did it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow a spoofer i dont think thats ever been mentioned here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its just so disheartening and unbelievable when you see it happen that it gets mentioned again and again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all my house spawns have not been ditto
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have caught countless pidgeys and rattatas since ditto started and only managed one ditto the day before yesterday so dont complain i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky i catch everything and i only have ditto at least i have tons of pidgey candy lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my house pidgey spawn has about ditto every hrs but some run so it could be more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a gym and pokestop spawn point by a creek on my way to work that seems to give ditto pretty regularly it makes about six spawns in that area i ride my bike past there twice a day once to and once from work and have gotten four ditto there this week just passing by
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rngesus works in odd ways i have the same situation at my house about accessible with gps drift two nearly always rattata or pidgey no ditto youre sorta rubbing it in a little with the title for those that keep getting the ironic gotcha i cant be too upset though the rngesus has blessed me in other ways my one iv was an eevee that rolled into a vaporeon whp after i used up the naming trick and i hatched two fbb lapras just after i hit level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bad post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lucky a ton of pidgey candy was my aim i now have or had as most have been fed to the grinder a number of low cp poor iv dittos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that isnt irony
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,any reason why i was fairly careful in the language etc if i can changeclarify something
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i may be wrong here but ill say why i thought it was irony the expression of ones meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite typically for humorous or emphatic effect gotcha usually is a positive statement meaning whoopee you caught the mon every time i dont see oh now on a pidgeyrattatakarp it feels like the devs at niantic are pointing at me while saying gotcha which is pretty funny
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,jealousy mostly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is the silph road the silph road is a grassroots network of pokémon go™ trainers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it isnt ironic because seeing gotcha is expected and as of recently seeing oh can also be expected to happen although not as frequent as gotcha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bragging is not the purpose of this reddit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes but the double meaning of gotcha was not expected as in hah you thought you were going to get a ditto by catching all these pidgey and rattata gotcha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this was not my intention the intention of the post was to see if other people had observed similar behaviour i am lucky enough to have access to some spawn points i can observe all day as such i thought the observed behaviour of ditto spawns would be of interest to the wider group there have been posts asking about ditto spawn behaviour to try and pin down a pattern this i thought would add to that information the slight whimsical post title was because i have found in general that ditto are not actually large enough or strong enough to be of much use after the first few oh animations i find id rather have had the pidgey or rat maybe this will change and at least i have the candy to power one up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but unfortunately the gotcha that shows up isnt a double meaning it only means gotcha as in you got the pokemon not ha gotcha you thought i would be ditto i do see where your coming from its close to being irony sort of but it isnt lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in response to my post maybe i should have included the s tag i dont really know why it is a bad post to be honest i would suggest giving your input to one of the other posts suggesting a spawn pattern to ditto if you havent already because for whatever reason those posts took off better than yours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a chansey can spawn anywhere theyre just extremely rare lots of people have received like chanseys from eggs its just all about rng im at myself and im still missing chansey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen one dragonite three snorlax and chansey when will trading become a reality
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definetely not in lure spots best way to get a chansey is trying to figure it out a place where was seen before go that place few days and walk to find it in your sighting list i highly recommend look for after i caught a chansey close to and my sister close to so i think night is better hope you be able to find it good luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught all of my chanseys at night in montrose of them within minutes on honolulu last week never from an egg though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,over eggs and no chancey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrpokemongoivs thats the sub for questions about what to evolvepower up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont rush it takes forever to get magikarps so i would try to get a similar magikarp with more cp already i would give up iv perfection for more cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would wait until you are a higher level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id go with the one no question about it the highest magikarp ive ever caught is only is pretty strong for a magikarp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the or you could hold off and wait for a perfect one i dont know how close you are to magikarp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you i didnt know about that sub
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you dont want to wait go for the but that will take awhile to get a high cp gyrados more stardust tbh i wouldnt put too much stardust on gyrados i prefer to put it on strong defenders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,depents on your area i usually use days of hours playtime to collect magikarps
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the silph co is a company in the pokemon video games
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikisilphco
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax id love to phind
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel like the actual question has not yet been answered yes silph derives from silph co from the game but what does silph mean see in bulbapedia name origin silph cos name is a corruption of sylph a mythological creature
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the thing i love the most about the silph road is the community and the potential scope that it has i think that working together as a team we could end up seeing things way beyond our wildest pokémon imagination
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wasnt wearing my glasses one day and clicked a link it did not say the milf road i stayed anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lotta people who didnt play the main games huh
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for asking i never had a clue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lmao thanks for the shout out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sylph means imaginary spirit of the air road means a wide way leading from one place to another especially one with a specially prepared surface that vehicles can use so theres that edit obvious sarcasm i guess some dont understand that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and in the game they manage to get their entire story building taken over by a gangwtf do they not employ security guards
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah but what does silph mean
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i always thought that name is a parody of the darknet group the silkroad xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i learned something new today
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,holy crap i thought it was an oblique reference to final fantasy iv httpfinalfantasywikiacomwikisylphcave
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hope you got your flute
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,silph road potential scope i see what you did there i hope my upvote will rocket your team to the top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty much anyone over im guessing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,early on i kept calling out people who hopped on pokémon go for the hype with zero knowledge about the franchise and history ive since stopped trying to care
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or silph co is a company from the pokemon games and its a pun on silk road
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do they not have guns is it that what you are asking my texan friend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you realize that it really is a combination of silph co and the silk road trade route right that is the whole concept of the sitegroup unfortunately as you pointed out trading is not a thing yet so since release this sub has been a community for help and news often being the first to get news and now that is what it is known for
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikisilkroad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its actually a really dark pun get it dark
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes so lets celebrate it we should be glad that go is getting new people into pokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but why male models
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that group is referencing the original silk road
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it is its both
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha i thought that at first as well but then rememebered silph co
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,phlute
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was actually thinking under because that seems to be the main age group of reddit anyways
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does it matter of all games pokemon is the furthest from being exclusive in any way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea it sounds like you were just being a douche who cares if pokemon go was peoples first games
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why the hell would you call out people who started playing the game as if they need to go back and do the others before theyre allowed to play go what
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rgatekeeping
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpbulbapediabulbagardennetwikisilphconameorigin or the pokemon games got silph from the imaginary spirit of the air
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or what i posted is the direct context of what those words mean and mildly sarcastic next time put your hand up the joke wont go over your head
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in japan guns are restricted to police and militaryso silph coprobably wouldnt have armed securityof course they can always use airsoft guns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really hmm nope just assumed road was from well you travel a lot in this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont get it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,take your upvote😂😂
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you for introducing me to this beautiful piece of art
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that was i though from what i recall the silk road was an asian european trade route and a cheap skate asia grinder
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no its a reference to the actual silk road trade route out of china you know the one from history
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its super nerdy and were all nerds i conflated the serpent road and the sylph cave and i dunno what udronpes was thinking when he registered the domain maybe it just tickled his fancy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heres a sneak peek of rgatekeeping using the httpsnpredditcomrgatekeepingtopsorttoptall of all time im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its almost like game freak knows a fake company called silph is in fact imaginary
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but in tsrs context its based on the name from the games alone i bet the founders of tsr had no idea about the meaning of silph co s name
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no sorry you were not being sarcastic just admit you didnt know what it meant and move on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its nerf or nuthin
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no its actually a reference to how victory road has been commercialized and how all top trainers have bought their way there through silph co products
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats just idiocy i had never played and i figured that out within about minutes of starting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ask udronpes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol i definitely know what it meant nice try keyboard warrior
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpimgsxkcdcomcomicstenthousandpng title ten thousand titletext saying what kind of an idiot doesnt know about the yellowstone supervolcano is so much more boring than telling someone about the yellowstone supervolcano for the first time stats this comic has been referenced times representing of referenced xkcds httpswwwxkcdcom httpswwwredditcomrxkcd httpswwwredditcomrxkcdtranscriber httpxkcdrefinfostatistics
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we actually knew both though sylph is not a commonly known word wed looked into where the name silph might have come from and yes its a play on the silk road and the silph technology company from the pokemon universe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol resorting to random name calling i see
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its like i was right or something
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just calling it like i see it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see lots of meowth and barely have any electric pokemon i thought he was more in city type areas than electric
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes of pokemon in my area are magnemite voltorb spearow meow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i work in an industrial area marked on osm magnemite is the most prevalent pokémon and meowth is definitely common here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just spent a weekend in electric biome meowth were definitely prevalent but my common biome is grassbug and i see a touch more cats there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,meowth is one of the most common pokémon in my deserty biome where the only voltorb and magnemite ive seen are from nests
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live near a magnemite and voltorb biome and notice a decent amount of meowth as well so its not an abnormal thing to see
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,our whole city is full of magnemites voltorbs and meowths too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a theory that meowth is the last easter egg hanke referred to so my question is have you got a fully leveled fully powered up meowth
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here desert biome with voltorb and magnemite pretty uncommon but meowth is everywhere basically no difference compared to halloween event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do not what do you think it is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im hoping he talks when tapped on i found all other pokemon with near full cp in the wild bad ivs usually never have i ever seen a full cp meowth powering up a meowth is also like cp at a time in the series meowth is the only pokemon that can talk would be a reasonably easy easter egg to have and would follow the same lore reference as the eevee tricks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its been a couple hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is hilarious i love that someone made this reference they like pabloooooooo why you taking so much time to drop that pogoo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it will be released on a separate site only a few have access to tidalbeta then after a while it will be dropped to everyone else and it will be slightly disappointing because everyone had such high hopes because of who made it but it will still be solid because its kanyepokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,major companies seem to have a different definition of the words today and soon than the general public in most scenarios it makes me feel like ive been using those words wrong my entire life that or i personally love in a time paradox and their is my
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you and me should be best friends
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and they were both unfinished when they were released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably talking about ingress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why cant you just shut your mouth and take my cash though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this though you sirmaam are on point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,with the digital nature of things i tend to go by california time i also tend to give a full hour cycle to today comments after all they arent banks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,several pokemon will be screwed if this happened why would scyther want bug buzz for example what use would kabutops have for mud shot poor vaporeon would no longer be able to use aqua tail to its full potential how would snorlax survive with hyperbeam using its pathetic special attack actually those last two might not be so bad basically this is not a good idea with the limited movesets we have right now especially with no way to reroll if you get stuck with an underwhelming moveset and until that changes its probably for the best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess a way around this would be to introduce tms and release a huge array of moves to add customizing it could really breathe life into the game and get casuals more invested in the game scycther should be given uturn and its entire best tm arsenal maybe niantic is even able take a bit of liberties and create new moves per say snorlax could be given giga impact instead of hyper beam to make up for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pls dont look at the preview xd all logos from last time and more today uk wales netherlands and luxembourg now each day new logos tomorrow ireland scotland austria and switzerland hope you still like it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice can you make the red and white one a little different instead of a horizontal break what if you made it like ° so the top of the s is white and the bottom red just like a pokeball dose that make sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and the little lines should be red on the top two and white on the bottom two thatd be super cool
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are we talking about the polish one would be an idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably their biome still could use some more data point though ive caught grimer at target college campus at a bank dont know if theres any correlation between them or not because i only have data points
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know the only wild grimer ive ever caught spawned in the fragrance section of a department store
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,days ago i caught a grimer not sure time or biome and just minutes ago caught a muk maybe they raised the spawn rates because ive never seen them spawn before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel like one should spawn near my rubbish bin once a week or something id love to just have anything spawn near my house actually
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems like a biome thing ive caught basically all of mine in alleys and parking lots
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on the beginning of the game i caught of my first grimers on alleys shown on the map and it were not that close places it git to a point that i saw a grimer on sightings and then just looked in the map where was the alley near me and there he was on a small one that was actually part of a buildings parking it made sense to me too since its on alleys that youre most likely to find trash nowadays it seems to have changed though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only saw my second one ever nights ago the first one was back in january at the gas station by my apartment and the second was at the parking lot of my job
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught one at my city hall and another member in the fb group im in said they caught one at a city courthouse ive hatched two i had to walk the rest of it to finally get enough candy for muk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the only wild grimersmuks ive ever seen were in downtown city areas in san francisco and detroit makes sense i suppose ive only ever seen four the whole time ive been playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,saw one the day before the water event near some train tracks in an industrial area of portland surprisingly it was next to a hippie yoga studio
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the day i set grimer as my buddy last late summerearly fall i caught wild it was weird
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can only remember of the grimers i gotten even tho my dex is telling me ive seen and caught one was from an egg i left sitting around for a really long time must have gone rotten one was in the restroom at a park not surprised one was in a rundown dennys again im not the least bit surprised
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen grimers and caught all since late september one was a hatch were at my house spawn months apart and the recent one fled in a subdivision was in a church parking lot in a grocerygas station parking lot and the other were random while driving with my kid operating both our phones all were in the burbs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anecdotal caught my first one ever besides hatching a couple days ago during water event in a small town residential area nothing special about location our biome is mostly grass clefairy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they definitely spawn in town bioms which is almost absent in california southern us etc cause your lucky with desert biom everywhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a few months ago i caught grimer on the same pokestop on consecutive days around the same time i caught one yesterday but i think theyre not that rare in my biome ive also caught muk close to my work where i caught grimer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a biome thing i pass a certain area on my way home every day caught grimers seen one on sightings and muk in that exact area meters x meters i assume
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have caught only the first one was by this one way sign outside a lighthouse that was a charmander nest the other were on college campuses unfortunately none of them had good stats
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i questioned whether they raised spawn rates as well the first grimer i caught was back in october or november it surprisingly spawned at my house i saw my second during the water event last week it was somewhere in my residential area according to the sightings list but i couldnt find it a few days afterward i caught one downtown at a governmental building in a nearby city ive read enough of this board to chalk unique occurrences up to rng but i did think it was strange that after months of no grimers i suddenly see two within a few days of each other but its a rare pokemon so it makes sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i remember this kind of thing happening with me around that time period whenever i would set a pokemon as my buddy i would start to see them in the wild
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think its rng ive seen lots of starters on my sightings in my small town small neighborhood today
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my nearby at home has been constant with at least starters at once most of the time there are three already caught plus in an hour and since have just been looking for the second and third evolution mons i dont think there are any set patterns to anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think they are replacing commons in specific single spawn points there is a charmander where a venonat or something similarly annoying always used to be a block from my house and a charmander occasionally spawns from my house now too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think its biome specific
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im at vacation in universal right now which has a lot of spawns and starter spawns barely went up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its weird seems random playing with it right now i cant find a reason and they change position seemingly randomly that said its mostly been by dex number but not consistently
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ikr pretty annoying when i am about to bubblestrat since i have all my cp pokemon on the slot so i can simply doubletap so swap my bubblestrat team very quickly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,long distance travels in a short period of time even when you snipe cause soft bans or account flags also the most popular spoofingapps got coded so badly they send ban criteria report them and wait for the next bann wave i bet the next bannhammer will come right afterbefore the next big content update gen trading battling legendaries when many lost players rejoin the game that way it wont look like oh more than of playerbase stopped playing while most of them are filthy cheater also they need supportcapacity to work on false positives and flaming spoofers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rpokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cosmetic only to think otherwise is wishful thinking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,currently i dont think they do other than to spark hopefully friendly competition among trainers i think somewhere in the update megathread niantic had said theyve only rolled out of the features they have plannedintended so atm no in the future id find it hard to believe they if they didnt matter how so though no idea maybe global competition like ingress or localregional events or something else entirely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on average there are more valormystic players than instinct so instinct has more rivals rival gyms give more xp than friendly gyms so if you want to gain a lot of xp taking down gyms id say instinct is the better choice of course this depends on where you live too if there are very few gyms or its mostly instinct in your area than it isnt as worth it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think its better to be on instinct because you can capture and keep gyms more often because theirs so many to take
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,instinct level and i get hardly any k eggs so i would say no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,team ultraball and can confirm the rarity in eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they dont matter yet i expect we will be seeing legendary events coming soon possibly with themed challenges for the different teams
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cant remember what article or interview it was in but they did say that some time soon the teams and gyms would be much more significant thats all that was said though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my guess is that you will be able to catch only the mascot legendary bird of your team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i want to agree but without data how can we know edit wow why the downvotes they arent convincing and i am looking for serious answers please explain how we can know without data look at the thread from a few days ago where the guy plotted egg hatced ivs against caught ivs and the egg hatched pokemon were consistently better we never would have found that without data
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at this point i think the amount of is a function of how new eggs a person gets which is a function of how many they hatch edit downvotes are not convincing if every egg has a in chance of being then of course someone who hatches more will get more please explain where i am wrong instead of downvoting and ignoring
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,people downvote because they dont want to hear the truth or they are idiots they want answers that suit them but fact lol they dont want them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same experience only getting curveball bonus on a related not finding g the pokemin broke free to be rather annoying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been getting curveball bonus consistently now though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes no bonus xp for nice great and excellent none nada
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh no should i not update then seems like a lot of features excellent features are missing i was relying on great throws to help gain extra xp prior to mass transferring
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,stupid decision imo why take away a gameplay element that was working fine especially when you have so little gameplay to begin with
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seemed to be the point of the throwing game trying to get it in the circle any word on if this is a bug or on purpose i have to think its unintended since you still get the great and nice indicators on the catch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,didnt get a bonus for nice throw listed however we should check it by comparing total experience gained before and after not believe the list displayed after catching a pokemon in fact i noticed i got around experience points after a pokemon fled from my pokeballs and ran away sadly wont be able to check it till later today since i have pokemon around me at home
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can confirm i got an excellent throw and got no exp from it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so they took out another feature o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes on ios and the lack of bonus for such throws overrides the curveball bonus that i can now get on every throw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looks like only curveballs are getting a bonus after the update standard
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup having the same issue curveballs working though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,on the other hand curveballs only happen when i want it too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im still getting the bonuses for niceetc throws but i havent gotten a bonus for curveballs in days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did get bonus on top the base xp and a curve ball all together dont know why didnt see a mention for mon of a specie or anything like that but it was a zubat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have the same issue with no nicegreatexcellent throw bonuses though it still says you did it in the capture screen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not getting these bonuses only curveball bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup the great and excellent throws arent working but i got a bonus on a normal throw on catching a pokemon just happend once thou so whats this new bonus thingy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah im experiencing it too is it a glitch or an intentional change i didnt see this listed in the description of the latest update if its intentional its a damn shame its satisfying to be rewarded with a slim and skillful catch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure if i got another micro update and didnt notice or not but since i installed the update to get rid of tracking i have been getting the bonus for great and sometimes not weird man havent been paying attention for nice and i straight up never get excellent throws lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only getting curveball bonuses now and sometimes it doesnt recognize a curveball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw this happen a few times today it caught my eye when i got an excellent throw catch and no bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i actually had a great throw give me instead of then for some reason after catching the pokemon and transfering it i gained over all instead of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this seems to just be a text issue on the battle screen if you look at the xp popup in the bottom left after battle or the actual xp you gained all of the bonuses remain intact
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is huge im sure this is on purpose theres no way this is a glitchbugwhatever like when people were thinking the step glitch was an accident niantic keeps pulling these nerfs without any indication in patch notes or wherever im sure this will decrease exp gain for most by a good percentage im sure they still give the added catch rate though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just got a nice throw so i guess its working for me im on android
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cant confirm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,negative
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,regarding the message i believe it is to prevent the bug that causes the game to freeze if you go into your bag when the pokemon runs away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to be fair in the actual pokemon games a similar message is shown after a pokemon breaks out too theyre trying to be sort of realistic while also fixing a bug i dont have a problem with it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really im the opposite i like the message afterwards
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same it feels like it is rubbing it in with the message
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i do notice that you get the curve ball bonus a lot more now however what is more annoying is that you dont get the nice great or excellent bonus if you get the curve ball too it seems like for me at least i am only getting one or the other
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,upgrading isnt optional
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre going to have to update really soon to keep being able to play so youre not going to gain much by not updating right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well they affect the catch rate too so its possible that theyve changed such throws to do only that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i checked the total exp i do not receive the bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is no mention of just the ambiguous bonus xp line
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can check in your pokedex how many of a mon you have caught
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokémon of that type caught
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sounds like you had an excellent throw those are worth a bonus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is your trainer level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats a silly way to prevent that bug makes sense though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,realistic were talking about pokemon here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a bit of duh thing like each time you opened your bag it said youve opened your bag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can confirm that im currently playing on android without updating caught stuff as recently as minutes ago no idea how long itll continue to work of course
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are you certain that nicegreatexcellent affects catch rate from what source did you get this information it certainly doesnt feel like i get better catch rates with better throws today i threw an ultra ball and landed an excellent only to get the pokemon broke free
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i always wondered what that xp bonus was
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,crap misread the post didnt check the xp bonus got a nice throw and no exp its really not working
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think they also implemented the delay for you to be able to begin throwing pokeballs in order to prevent the extending shadow bug i really think they are not very good at actual software development a lot of things in this app scream amateur hour
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lots of thing niantic does these days are silly
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a better term is faithful i think
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,can we get this added pls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im playing and caught pokes minute ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i totally feel like an excellent throw increases the chances seems to me like excellent might do as much as going up a ball tier completely subjective ofc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it definitely does of course you can make the best throw in the world and still not catch the pokemon thats just rng for you but a majority of the time better throws will catch the pokemon sooner i cant give any hard proof but i did play the game for over hours yesterday and catch over pokemon during that time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have replied to a comment on reddit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tried to play but nothing would spawn for me until i updated that was a couple of hours ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have received a reply to a previous comment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mate they are all over the place its fully started
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mid uk and its definitely started spawns arent crazy about of what the halloween spawns were but give it some more time yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not in the uk but the spawns arent wildly increased here either but there are more starters showing up than normal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,scotland here definitely started around an hour ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got nothing ive just got home from work but on the way back all that came up were the usual junkmons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill see if i notice a difference on the way to work tomorrow on the way home tonight and now at home its just the usual suspects not a starter in sight
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn i was hoping it was something like the halloween event i get that it mightve been op if everyone ended up with all the starters and their evos etc but still
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cheers i guess ill be able to gauge it properly when im out and about tomorrow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i was hoping for a bit more that said of my charmanders have been caught in the last half hour i caught charmander
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you get the latest update that was released this morning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,jeez
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly its garbage it was highish on the latest defender tier list i saw but im not convinced
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont power up anything that isnt the top on the tier list anything below that is good to have and use but i wouldnt spend any dust on them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,may be a good one for gym training instead of defending would work well on fire
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah im honestly really mad that they changed rock throw for mud shot such a garbage move
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my area there are people that have limited time waiting for the bus etc it is common for them to start battling a gym then leave before they are completely done in a few cases ive seen the gym go down but then sit there empty waiting for the first trainer to come in those cases the bottom few are shaved off then another trainer comes ready to take the gym up a level and place their mon in thats the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes unfortunately that is what the gym scene is like in a lot of areas its cpdriven as you fight for spots with your own team to avoid shaving hopefully the gymoverhaul that is the next major update will resolve this issue until then your only solution is going to be getting higher cp pokemon or finding very rural gyms that have low turnover you could also find highturnover gyms that never get that high and claim them all late at night and collect
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rhydon hasnt been intelligent gym meta for a while sure high cp but so easy to remove as for shaving thats the reality if you are in the bottom few spots many people if not most are out for themselves and see this as a solo game atm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sadly thats how the game works this has happened to me many times level atm the only real way to battle this is by trying to get the highest cp pokemon you can at level you should be able to have cp pokemon even without having a gyaradosdragonitetyranitar etc you need to try and get into a spot with at least people under you that should probably keep you in a gym for a while
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not to demoralize you but isquite low i have two eggs and i had to stop using them as defenders because even that cp wasnt high enough im in gyms now and my lowest active defender is a vaporeon also if you didnt actually see the shaving happen live then its just as likely that somebody attacked the gym a few times and walked away and then someone else came along and trained it up there are four level valor gyms at my metro station and i usually only have enough time to fight two or three things before i have to run and catch my train unless you left some information out youre jumping to conclusions about what happened
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how do you know it was shaved here are quite often being attacked by passers by they take off prestige until their team lasts and move on it is likely that someone just leveled it back and put whatever they had in the last slot i really doubt someone would shave in this scenario
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was recently a weeks shaved out of a level gym that i painstakingly trained to level it was a loooong time ago like octnov and at the time i was top dog with my snorlax it was painful finding him kicked out and the gym a level but cp is king currently hopefully with a gym rework well have a different metric for determining gym placement
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how exactly does one shave do you have multiple accounts you use to lower it and then add your own or is there an option to bump your own teammate out if you have a higher cp pokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i am one of those people who do that attack pokemons and leave when i need to decent exp and i rather do this than browse facebook or something
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no need to brag youre level you must have missed the part where they said they were levels below you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they use multiple accounts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what move is it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,confusion and zen headbutt are legacy moves bullet seed and extrasensory took their place
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyarados is missing dragon pulse and twister legacy moves also
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,confusion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,legacy moves so shouldnt there be another title named legacy moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,legacy moves are not missing they are simply not included
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i remember finding others but someone said they were working on the dex and honestly i cant remember and have a headache and im gonna try to get some sleep
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think they separate current and legacy moves on tsr pokedex i think it was mentioned in a thread a week or ago to maybe add a button on legacy moves to differentiate them from current moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,guess i should have said dragon breath should be removed on gyarados
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my point was some legacy moves are there some arent i dont remember the ones i saw when looking at the pokedex a week or two ago i didnt remember when i posted last night whether they were supposed to be included or not i do know it wasnt consistent
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,appreciate this post but unfortunately this topic is stirring up a little too much drama on the road right now and the community is fatigued of the topic from the many posts about it in the past few days were consolidating this discussion to the threads already on the front page about this ds thanks for helping us keep the road constructive and uncluttered
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i personally liked the high gym turnover earlier on sure didnt complain about it things swung too far to the other extreme and now gyms are no longer a part of the game for many of us we cant take them down cant stay in them without being bumped out by a teammate with a higher cp and a second account so why bother so yeah gym stagnation is a big problem if you dont think it is then you probably are benefitting from the problem and your denial is self serving but yeah it is a big problem and needs to be fixed though i understand you want your gravy train to keep going
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have given multiple suggestions on multiple threads now but the short answer is to either make it hard to stay in a gym long term by weakening those pokémon over time so that by the second week you are more of a paper tiger or simply give a much bigger a reward for each level someone brings a gym down so even if you cant bring a gym totally down its still worth it just to make a dent
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you i understand that my issue was the perceived bias in the way these posts are being moderated ie pro status quo posts being deleted while anti status quo posts being allowed to remain in particular the posts which are very obviously anti status quo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how would you fix it then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it wont work if you reduce the incentive to holding gyms less people will bother to try and take them since the reward for taking them will be reduced the end result is a new equilibrium with even less people playing and stagnation yet again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyarados here just tons of magikarp in the area so i think ive evolved at least and caught more im lvl by the time i do a lucky egg to evolve im usually halfway to my next one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,drowning in bulbasaur exeggcute poliwag not sure any of the above really count as coveted but im interpreting this as biome commons that are strong gym contenders would trade any of the above being common to be in a growlithe rich area based on my impressions from browsing tsr grimer is probably the most coveted i see a decent amount of though i hardly drown in them grimer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nothing all we have are the bugs and the rats andeevee yep thats about it maybe magickarp a day maybe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,clefairy seen and caught clefable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exegg id say they are of my local gym defenders so common here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,staryus pinsirs goldeens psyducks and slowpokes here apparently dallas is a water and bug biome makes sense i guess
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bellsprouts got victreebells and for bellsprouts also poliwags have poliwraths and for poliwags this is considering i dont catch them all since they bore me now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have iv rhydons one of them is a who was wild caught rhyhorns are all over the place in denver and theyre usually high iv edit i have seen exactly one koffing and zero weezing i have never even seen a grimer i saw a muk in a gym once
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea vapes here evees are almost as common as rats so i see them all the time in gyms i have about differnet eveeloutions most of them high ivs evolved a few before i checked ivs and most close to level also still have a lot more candy for when any good ones appear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have cp venusaurs one with vwsolar beam other with rlsludge bomb both with iv of and still have bulbasaur candy ive been blessed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eevee seen caught vaporeon jolteon flareon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not really drowning but ive caught a bunch of porygon they spawn in my neighbourhood somewhat frequently have caught and never looked for one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hypno so many drowzee at one point i had hypno which was after i transfered all the low ivlow cp ones i got rid of almost all of them and sit on candy again id love to have that much arcanine or poliwrath or something which is actually useful instead of hypno which is nice but cant get high cp so its not useful as defender and doesnt counter anything commonly used as defender so its not useful as an attacker either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got nothing squirtles arent too rare here but they are basically inferior vapes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is this humblebrag im on level and have no arcanines one several growlight t t i think i get a lot of pinsir slowpoke and bulbasuar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have had candies total for growlithe damn you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax and magikarpgyarados rural fl
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nidoqueens here i am genuinely gleeful when i hatch a growlithe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pinsirs are common i ignore them half the time of all the starter pokémon i see bulbasaur or the time also see a decent amount of ivysaurs and ive come across venasaur spawns in my neighborhood a few times also poliwags also during one migration period i was catching a snorlax or two every week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,before the event drowzee and jynx during the event drowzee and jynx
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,soooo many pinsirs theyre kinda useless hard to catch cant use the candy to evolve and arent powerfulhigh cp enough to do much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have blastoise i evolve to an arcanine probably once a week and have lapras over cp my first ever pokemon other than my starter was a chansey i dont have a porygon yet i have every other pokemon even the regional ones because i travel often across continents hundreds of cities never have i ever even seen the porygon on my sightings
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just found a local growlithe nest that boosted my seencaught eevee squirtle nidoran males clefairy and plenty more i dont bother catching
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eevees for days seriously i have over eevee candy at least a dozen vaporeon flareon and jolteon each i cant count have many ive transfered i have vapes alone i use in gyms that are sitting above cp at one point i was trying everything i could think of to see if there was a way to get a specific one to evolve after the rainer trick was used and chance and a prayer to rngesus was the outcome of that experimentq
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just finally finished walking to get the candies for my first arcanine this morning i get loads of clefairyclefable here though not as much as your growlithe sounds like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,snorlax here seen caught i have transferred many
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exeggutors and poliwraths here it seems due to the nature of my region even when nests shift high counts of both remain consistent
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sitting on eevees about candy and at least a dozen of each eeveelution
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,until recently i was drowning in pinsir i had about at cp plus many others i had tossed i purged them because the thing is so crappy in gyms without its furyscissor moveset and i was barely ever getting that i think of my had it of course with double candy going and after hatching a scyther yesterday i hatched a lowiv bad moveset pinsir this afternoon im now at pinsir candy its awesome because he has no second form at least if i were drowning in scyther i could prep for a bunch of scizor when gen releases instead ive got essentially an unlimited supply of candy of a egg pokémon who cant evolve and isnt worth squat in gyms dont let that fool you though ive gotten plenty of scyther as well i think ive hatched same for pinsir i have candy there sure ive caught many more pinsir to be exact than scyther but despite only having caught scyther ive got a healthy amount of candy from the notuncommon hatched of him i think the caught bulbusaur hatch in that is a healthy number for me too oh and i hatched dratini a couple of weeks back to reach dragonite giving me a seencaught on that given im not in a waterheavy area nor have i seen a dratini nest im pleased to have a highiv dragonite because of those eggs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just evolved my dragonite all of them are except one i caught at cp i might be able to add poliwrath i have and have transferred a few three are also
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,growlithes here also i have caught and i have arcanines i actually see way more growlithes on a day to day basis but i do not even catch them anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my campus spawns snorlaxes per day there is also a geodude spawn point and a growlithe spawn point in the middle of the soccer field
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,arcanine gyarados vaporeon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for us here we have a good mix of everything and our community began reporting nests early and we track them so its hard to say considering radar use was heavy here id say that all lsd elites are common enough here i guess id say exeggecuteexeggecutor right now since a major nest switched to them some of my teammates have like of them and candies but outside of this slowpoke and growlithe have both had big nests with heavy spawn points also so theres lots of their evolutions too i have poliwrath fed to their brothers because i didnt like the moveset slowbros had more but turned them into mulch too gyarados right now exeggcutors vileplume but had
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,famine there is a lot of drowzee that some people seem to never have seen but it is not good for gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not exactly drowning in them but for tangelas im theyre pretty common here and apparently not that common for a lot of americans
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,live near a lot of water so basically anything water type but also exeggutors
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lapras could have had more if i tried and snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyrados and lapras lapras and i dont know anyone with one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,porygon so not drowning in them but its more than most people have from what i read
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,clefable with candy left over vaporeon victreebell have a exegcutor with candies and another exegcutor idk like nidoqueens and nidokings wish i could find charmander though in pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,over run with drowzee seen and pidgey seen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have arcanine with best moveset lucky you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,only top fighter common around here is eevee had to get my arcanine and exeggcutor with buddy walk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,clefairy tends to be pretty common and i run into quite a few magikarp on the other hand more than half of my fire pokemon came from eggs or eevee
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonites and about nidoqueensnidokings i wish i had machops growlithes seels and lapras havent even seen onehatched one yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dratini caught and dragonair already evolved and maxed dragonites to level and spare candies left still have around dratini with iv farmed before the pokedex bug got fixed on the other hand i have caught only growlithes and of them were from hatches i have only one arcanine since i couldnt get any better high level growlithe powering the level hatched ones with better iv would have taken too many candies i dont have luckily i got the best attacking moveset only have candy left cant power him up from level to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,famine for me i have hatched to eggs not once have i hatched a seel though ive hatched everything else i know to some that live by the coast that this might be a common pokémon but i live by the coast and even then ive never seen it on my tracker either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonite have over cp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my citys downtown is always loaded with drowzee for a while i thought it had turned into a jynx nest and was excited but no still of those yellow tickle monsters on every corner edit i gave up catching them about a month ago i have seen and of those caught anyone need almost drowzee candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nidoran male and female are like pidgeys around me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can give you the most frequent answer right now arcanine and vaporeon other coveted pokemon arent common spawns and the people who live in the biomes would hardly call it drowning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i play in three towns along the colorado riverwouldnt you think id see magikarp on a regular basis nopemaybe three in a week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,having walked my super rare pet goldfish to over candies halfway i am very jealous
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whats your twister ratio evolved gyarados all twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exeggutor is very coveted more so than arcanine in my opinion speaking as one whos encountered wild growlithe and wild exeggcutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i died ive seen caught and had to evolve my muk from walking the good iv grimer i found my pokedex was finished at and im now o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulbasaur all hatches exeggcute had a private nest now long since migrated to rubbish poliwag reliable spawn on my walk in the morning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eevees are relatively rare around here so thats something at least
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow way more than i see here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep ive got bellsprouts and poliwaffles i dont click on them very often anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh yeah i have a lot of all three evolutions probably a good time to thin them out while i can get double candy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,drowzee caught before the eventthe actual spawnrate dropped during the event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah level here got my second ever growlithe from an egg last night luckily due to halloween i got a ton of candy so now have enough to evolve an arcanine otherwise id be buddying him up i guess nothing really raredesirable around me if i go into the nearest city there are lots of magikarp but i dont get much opportunity to farm them and they take so long to evolve that ive only managed to get three gyarados two with twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is this humblebrag i doubt it im in az and id trade half the growlithe candy ive aquired for at for dratini candy i expect people who think growlithe is rare have much more dratini
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hatched one during the event and still dont have candies haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im one of those show me types show me you blowin it out ya fanny jk s nice wish i had a job that sends me international you probably just dont even use non native regionals for tossing in gyms dont blame you for it i have a spoofer ive been reporting for close to months now my first tip off was he never showed up when he was battling gyms my next was he has khangiskhan around cp fishy business right there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have none at level tell me where you liveee
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blinks wowi just got my third oneat level lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im now at pinsir candy pinsir candies currently hell of an infestation around me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sitting on around pinsir candies too i pretty much ignore them now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aw i wish this that was the case here growlithes are one of my favourites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,according to my dex ive seen but that doesnt include the ribs i didnt even click on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow i have of each ive seen one lapras but it fleed after razzultra
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,omg can i ask wherehow you got all those i play a lot i live in your area and i have seen zero lapras and three snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent even caught that many pidgeys and im lvl dragonites man i give up everyone seems to have so much beast mons dont know why i still bother
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,deeeiimm boooiii i and i thought i was doing good with my dragonites and candies towards one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hatched one but all my others i got from a nest you might have a local nest too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that would be too logical i primarily play atdisney world
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,have you tried any parks that have a border on the river you might need to narrow your focus a bit sharper than a town if youre looking to find a biome theres magikarp all over white rock lake park in dallas but you dont have to go far from the lake before they become a pretty rare spawn
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the city i play in is maybe water biome i have evolved gyarados and have candy right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been walking the goldfish since buddy system was enabled was finally over yesterday but still looking for a a high cpiv karp to evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolved like never got twister and now i hope to get one with twister to put in gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,out of my have twister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive cashed in most of the ones with low cp andor evals but of the i still have have bitehydro pump one has bitetwister and one has dragon breathtwister
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my first two have twister and the first one took me months to get my one finally knew dragon pulse my cousin is two for with hydropump
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me too ive seen clefairy clefable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i save them for now always good for training to have them at different cp ranges plus evee candy is easy as to get so no point to get candies when im still sitting on a few hundred unless i run out of pokemon space
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ilam is where ive caught all mine they arent super common though so i wouldnt expect to get any ive gotten or since the game started hagley park is a charmander nest which is a lot more common
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,caught almost none since the event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id trade it like i must have like arcanines already
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im hoping that i can hatch one i really need an arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,north mississippi just south of memphis tn snorlax is apparently part of this biome and not even a rare spawn we get nothing but grass and bug types with pidgey rats and eevee with the occasional snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better i just caught my first one for this event like mins ago on the way home from work seems like they had just disappeared until tonight
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive caught and hatched none too level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i played a lot in sf over the summer so thats where all the lapras came from snorlax are mostly in residential areas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im in the tokyo area actually but i have a location advantange regarding water biome since my workplace is a few meters away from a river in a very populated tokyo ward and since i also live meters away from a much smaller river which also spawns dratini kabuto omanyte
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have walked miles along the riverwalk and at multiple river side parks and beaches i actually live in a subdivision that is on manmade lakes not sure if its because the greater area is the mohave desert but they sure are scarce for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,stay right beside guadalupe river with parks ajoining said river zero water pokes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that will be the second half of the battle my karps are all pretty mediocre so i will have to travel to find something worth evolving i fear that regardless of what i do twister is in my horizon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,udronpes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats basically normal type biome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seriously salted by this statement ive caught like legit from scanners you live my dream lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live right next to a major river that runs through town water spawns in town as well doesnt make sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would call it a meadow biome since theres also a lot of bug and grass
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,had someone setup a scanner that was scanning spawn points around memphis hot spots for one day were scanned at the end of the day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably spoofers or bots or extra accounts using spare lures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyre lure farming they create extra accounts bot them up to level and get the free lures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,have never seen so many lures in use even when pokémon go was at its peak but all the usernames seem like a bunch of random characters i can see pokestops from the pub im in and theyre all lit like christmas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looks like pokealert a scanner app that also can be used to generate accounts i used to use the app a lot but i believe that it now has a function to drop lures if the scanner accounts have them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i remember some dude in the park showing me a lure app he had found you would put in the exact name of the pokestop and submit within minutes a lure would be added to that stop you were limited to submissions per minutes it was proper dodgy but seemed to work really well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its scanner bots a few scanners recently added the ability to place lures with the bot accounts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see that sometimes not to often
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a bot that coincides with pokealert id recognize it anywhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i only see names like that in gyms with dragonites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the tracking app called poketrack also has a feature where the bots it uses can be used to place their lures once they get them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,everytime i visited my brother at the hospital i lit its pokestop kept it running and renewed it when leaving i felt like it was a good deed to all the patients of course i payed for the lures so if you have to cheat lit hospitals or something at least ffs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,saw a couple today too hadnt really thought about it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have seen way more lures recently
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the lures could have been placed by the pokealert app they added this capability in a recent update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lure farming indeed sounds profitable down here we have farmers going bankrupt every year from tobacco farming any white papers on this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,take note of all the account names and report them theyre spoofersbotters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,businesses do these things to bring in more people i live in stl and the college area loop does that every so often
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if these are random botter applications dropping the lures who is paying for them niantic is not going to tolerate revenue loss due to bots they will react by doing something to counter this this has the taste of the cheats getting their second of fame and then the rest of us getting screwed forever into the future with some draconian code change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep a certain tracker app has added the functionality of placing lures with the tracking accounts i guess now like botting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in my local facebook group someone offered lures for € obvious bottet accounts with free lures he got directly banned from group i think we should respect the company behind the game so feel free to play without money or spend money if you want to but botting accounts to save a few dollar for a game i like is the wrong way to support this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,interesting have never seen that before if i wasnt sat in a pub enjoying myself i might go take advantage of all the lures sadly none within reach
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if they are pubs then it might be the owners making new accounts for the free lures and placing them down to try draw customers in a diner near me sometimes puts them down at low points in the day like just after the lunch rush to try draw customers in at lowsales points of them day to try get abit more cash flow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is awesome especially with them lasting an hour
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and very obviously cheating some people on this sub have no moral compasses play the game right or stop playing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol there are so many people playing for free in this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first time ive seen so many lures active last time i saw close to this someone changed their name to and lit up about half as many
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you play near some beautiful pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are a few in the app store is this an ios app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,those map bots need killed anyway cheating is cheating disgusting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually we should boycott this horse crap business model and not pay money for anything ever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what pub can you reach pokestops from the only one ive found is made in mexico over on main and thats only if the gps drift is lucky and you can hit more than one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,these are all over some by pubs and restaurants some by parks or trails some by churches
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you really think theyre going to waste their time playing a game to get in free lures im sure they bring in much more business than that and its easier to just buy them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its against the tos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its cheating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think youre being a bit hyperbolic its a party tracker not murder personally i see niantic cracking down on such behavior when they can and kudos but it doesnt really seem to detract from my enjoyment of the game to have someone else use a fake account to spawn a few extra pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the moral compasses of large chunks of the community were thrown overboard when trackers became popular months ago already btw the only way to run a tracker atm is to use a paid hashing service run by a commercial cheat developer as theyre the only one who cracked the latest api but the people who want their precious trackers dont care they will knowingly give financial support to the developers of bots to get what they want its rather sad to see such low moral standards in a community contrary to cs or other fps communities where cheaters are properly treated as the scum that they are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes my city is amazing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,scanners are a highly debated topic and even though they are clearly against the tos im for their use for people who dont have the luxury to live in a good area a good area to me would be as low as poke stops within walking distance of each other for people like me i have one pokestop nearby that completely screws over my sightings because there is always a single pokemon near it so my sightings are now limited to the single common at the pokestop instead of sightings of all of the misc pokemon that usually show up due to an eternally low amount of pokeballs i rarely play the game asis sorry not going to buy them anymore and im not going to freeze sitting outside a post office to get maybe pokeballs every minutes using bots to drop lures earned by leveling though thats definitely scummy and obviously its to get more people using their scanners possibly for ad revenue i havent used a scanner in a long time because ive resigned myself to my fate of living in a terrible area until submissions become available sometime in the far far future
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyd best be killed by having some decent ingame tracking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you boycott dont play the game or play it for free but botting accounts for lures is cheating and gives u a advantage to trainers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cant reach the pokestops from the pub i was in crows nest but can see a lot of them the only pubish ive found that you can sit in and reach pokestops is cachet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,molly blooms in waterloo ontario is a pokestop and irish pub
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont want to bring this thread back to life but where i live almost every bar and pub downtown is a or a pokestop is in range
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,probably spoofers or bots then id just enjoy the free lures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry thats what i mean the staff pay and the diner will give them money for each lure used its a small business so its not like a big corporate business plan
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill quote another user from this sub the moral compasses of large chunks of the community were thrown overboard when trackers became popular months ago already btw the only way to run a tracker atm is to use a paid hashing service run by a commercial cheat developer as theyre the only one who cracked the latest api but the people who want their precious trackers dont care they will knowingly give financial support to the developers of bots to get what they want its rather sad to see such low moral standards in a community contrary to cs or other fps communities where cheaters are properly treated as the scum that they are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the more niantic cripples the ingame montracking the more i will support third party devs that provide this service
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for what its worth aside from your very subjective morality line your paid service line is simply not true there are free trackers available
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats absolutely pathetic those mapping trackers cant die fast enough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,even those of us in cities often have to drive to the hotspots where i live im in the same situation as youve described but i just drive or take the bus into uptown to play honestly i dont see where you live as a valid excuse the only kinda of scan bots i tolerate is the ones like httpwwwgymhuntrcom a feature niantic needs to add that doesnt break the mechanics of the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,weve had good in game tracking for months pull up httpsthesilphroadcomtracker and use it were never going to have them give it to us like the party trackers do they make it too easy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wish i could but the pub i was in was too far away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,right i responded to that person too to start that doesnt begin to address me saying the moral compass thing is hyperbolic but also theyre just plain wrong there are numerous free trackers out there the payonly thing is nonsense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the ingame tracking is better than ever now for the huge majority of players with some ultra rural players which cant get over not being the target demographic of this game being the exception to the rule
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no matter if theyre free for the end user or not the developers of a commercial bot for pokémon go will profit from it because currently theres no other way to make api calls without using their hashing service which isnt free using a tracker currently means funding these parasites no matter if it seems free by using ads or whatever else to offer the service free for the end user it means funding people who have actively ruined gaming experiences for legit players in many online games by offering bot services for a long time now and i think that its rather sad that its now subjective to despise cheaters that was once pretty common amongst legit gamers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry but i refuse to drive to a location im not familiar with or ones that might be unsafe just to play a game especially since all of my friends quit and id be alone playing it all that does is make me a target and there are plenty who share my sentiments there are no gyms near me or in neighboring cities that i would feel safe playing against and two good locations for poke stops both minutes away which i refuse to walk alone for the gyms near me bit thats because there are literally no gyms within walking distance trackers can be used for cheating but they can also make the game feel safer for people who want to get in and get out the current tracker is garbage and can only barely be used in areas where stops are scarce
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they are useful for me as i have to drive a minimum of minutes to a place that pokémon spawn i use the atlas and previously trackers to make sure that i was going somewhere with something useful spawning and not my caterpie honestly i probably wouldnt be playing near as much if i couldnt find decent spawns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh so giving gps spoofers a roadmap directly to dominate the only competitive aspect of this game is ok by you but the year olds using a scanner to grab a snorlax that theyll never use in a gym is cheating cool bro
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id disagree particularly as the tracking of stuff nearby tends to fall apart because of some rats at distant pokestops having spots at best for tracking whats nearby is really bad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive actually been following that scene and theyre right there are free trackers that are free to users but unless something big has happened recently every one of those trackers use the paid party api the same one that botters use
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah no its garbage tbh the displayed sightings are limited to pieces which usually are commons from pokestops know rares spawn points are not monitored unless they have a pokestop nearby triangualating before that was hard and ineffective double spawns falling out from overflown sightings list unknows if spawned or entered range unknown if despawned or left the range but after the tracker update its literally impossible a few weeks ago i was waiting for a bus and i got message for a snorlax nearby from a tracker i know i know booo burn the witch and opened the nearby to find it from there and all i could see was horsea paras and other trash opened the tracker and the snorlax was just behind me when i came closer to it i went to the nearby stops to restock a bit i saw it spawning on top of the first pokestop like wtf opened again the sightings and it still was not there i have photos of this if you need a proof i live in the midtown of a big city with lots of stops but still dislike this tracker a lot i tend to hand out more in the scanner just in case something interesting popsout in the radius than in pokemon just in case some ratata or pidgey pops out near me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you know how you become familiar with new places you go to them the games core is built on exploring its not the games fault that you refuse to embrace that entire core mechanic of exploring the world around you look at the ingress intel map find a place with a ton of portals and go adventure explore get out and stop being such a pansy youll enjoy the game and the world much more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well thats pretty much the story for all players even those of us who live in big cities like me the residential areas are crap for spawns you still have to drive or get transportation somehow to the urban areas or parks to play as for the caterpie thing you said as we all know anywhere a caterpie can spawn more rare pokemon can also spawn its all an rng game unless you go to a nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,giving gps spoofers a roadmap normally id feel more inclined to agree with you but my experience with ingress and the ingress intel map makes it clear to me this fear is pretty much a moot point gps spoofers are going to be able to do this no matter what a party realtime web based gym map would benefit legitimate players orders of magnitude more than it would benefit gps spoofers the year olds using a scanner to grab a snorlax youre seriously kidding yourself to suggest its just the year olds who never use gyms are using the scanners if anything the pokemon scanners are even more useful for gps spoofers than gym maps can be
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah and they only implemented the nearby screen because of player demand for a better tracking system than the sightings screen even though the sighting screen was just about as good as the three step system if you used it correctly party trackers killed the first party one twice now first time by overloading the servers with bots and forcing them to set everything at steps and breaking the usefulness of it and now a second time by convincing niantic that players wanted a way to map the pokemon pokestops are the most logical way to do that in game without making too cheat level easy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the amount of rare pokémon that i now catch in places i wouldnt have visited without the new tracker outweigh the few i cannot triangulate any more by several magnitudes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea no i think ill enjoy not getting assaulted or robbed in a sketchy rundown town over playing the game thanks you have no idea what kind of areas other people live in what may be relatively safe for you definitely isnt the same elsewhere even as a group we had random people trying to bum cigs off of us none of us even smoked or showed that we smoked had a lovers quarrel happen for no reason at the park and had someone threaten another person with a crowbar at a gas station im staying clear of that place and those pokestops other than that town there are only tiny hodunk places with no stops at all which doesnt really help with exploring the world to play the game i dont agree with the trackers being used for free lures but if youre in an area like that and a rare pops up im not going to care if you cheat to find it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not that i have crap for spawns near me i live on a military base where there are zero spawns anywhere on base unlike most residential areas because of how the base is set up and the bases location i have to drive minutes before i get to a spot that anything spawns once hit where stuff starts spawning its pretty much junk with no nests that ive found or thatve been reported for another minutes from my house to the closest known nest is a minute drive i only use the atlas now but thats why trackers were useful for some of us i could actually have a chance at catching something new at least those who live in residential areas have the small chance of something spawning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if theyd let me change between nearby and sightings then id not have a complaint as it is i only started using a tracker once i reached the point where i didnt know about any pokemon closer than a minute walk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because they yours are tied to a pokestop duuh but these i know are without any pokestop nearby and with a clusterspawn near pokestop the first spawn regularly grimers eevees vaporeons omanites magicarps lapras snorlax and even time a dragonite i found them because i saw the rares in the and caught them every time in the same spot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill quote another user from this sub the moral compasses of large chunks of the community were thrown overboard when trackers became popular months ago already btw the only way to run a tracker atm is to use a paid hashing service run by a commercial cheat developer as theyre the only one who cracked the latest api but the people who want their precious trackers dont care they will knowingly give financial support to the developers of bots to get what they want its rather sad to see such low moral standards in a community contrary to cs or other fps communities where cheaters are properly treated as the scum that they are
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i can at least agree with the first sentence i still dont think its right to go to the trackers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a mobile game where many of the people cheating using trackers still adhere to all of the other rules of the game i could really give a dump less if someone is using a tracker to cheat to keep themselves interested in a game they can hardly play because of the lack of local content using a tracker in an area youre actually physically located in has little to no effect on other players in the same area spoofers are obviously and ruining the experience for others by catching the best of the best infinitely gathering items and downing gyms they arent physically at people using trackers arent the same goes for csfps games cheaters in those communities directly contribute to ruining the game for others youre entitled to your opinion on the matter but that doesnt stop me from thinking your opinion is wrong i clearly acknowledge trackers violate the tos but a lot of people using them arent doing so maliciously youre trying to compare apples to oranges with that quote and im not gonna have it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,little to no effect on other players in the same area absolutely ignorant you realize this is a gps mmo right those pokemon you catch with the trackers and then put on a gym the people around you have to compete against if no one cheated with those trackers everyone in your area would be on a relatively even playing field plus this is a game that will eventually get trading those using trackers have an insane advantage over those who play honestly setting up notifications for certain pokemon spawning near you so you never miss one where id have to constantly have my pokemon go app running and checking the nearby screen and hope that if one spawns near me it pops up people who use trackers may not have as big of an affect as multiaccounters or spoofers or botters but they do have an effect much larger than you realize ive only ever found one snorlax it ran ive only ever found one dragonite its horrible ive seen a handful of ubers that i could never find where youd have found it because you use your cheat maps to know exactly where it is and how long itll be there giving you a giant competitive edge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,practically i dont think any fire pokemon is a good gym defender a water gunhydro pump pokemon with half its cp would take it with ease arcanine is a bot of an exception due to its higher cp levels which allows it to reserve higher ranks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have one with that moveset until i got a fire fangfire blast arcanine the charizard was my goto for attacking exeggutors in gyms flamethrower does a lot of damage to grass types particularly with how quickly that it charges up and it has quicker animation that allows you to dodge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its fine like most fire types isnt so amazing in a gym and generally i think wing attack is the better move offensively but it works just fine even if it isnt particularly a better choice than a flareon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my charizard with waft is on top of a lvl gym over a week too btw i love it its perfect to kill all the high exeggutors
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charizard doesnt really have a place in the meta at all its cool and i love mine with the same exact move set but its just not good in gyms pokemon like arcanine are much better fire types and even if you do have an arcanine no fire types are worth defending the gym water pokemon like vaporeon are so damn powerful they destroy anything weak to them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a waft charizard thats been in a gym for over a week so its not the worst choice its top of tier which is higher than gyarados even with vaporeons everywhere its still holding
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exacrly my thoughti mean if in your opinion is in any way good as an attacker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here just not that moveset has proven highly effective and i prefer using it over my higher cp arcanine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wing attack charizard arcanine for defending imo vaporeon will beat both but itll take far more damage from charizard unless it eats a fireblast
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wing attack hurts vaporeons if they have to battle through a lot of things its really annoying flame thrower is probably the best defensive fire move
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly i never looked at charizard as a battle pokemon its just nice to see in the pokedex d arcanine in my experience is miles ahead of any other fire poke to attack with just gotta hit the jackpot with fangblast or even fangflamethrower
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive already an arcanine with bite and fo its workbut i would like to use charizard for affective reasonsmaybe ill use it anyway due to the fact that attacking its easy and the fact that im quite good to dodge i can put it in use
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they warned us thats not a bad thing the problem is that they dont offer a proper alternative yet and we are in the middle of summer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup they just liked this tweet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tried warning people earlier im assuming it has something to do with this especially with all the sudden in game changes without a warning and mila the person who made the api being used by the sites and bots has posted this according to mila it is not a fake letter received a cease and desist letter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey this really sucks does anyone have the api i think it would be best if we just hosted out own radar for our own personal use they wont cd something they cannot find
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,soooo whats the best alternative i have pokenotify and its good but its nice to get a look at your whole city any other web based apps without too much setup
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it was unavoidable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this site actually still works but doesnt show as many as pokevision httpsskiplaggedcompokemon so there are still ways to track them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup can confirm stopped working after the update ruins the fun in the game im not going to be playing now was about to actually spend money on the game for the first time this morning after work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id been using a mobile app poke live for awhile not a lot of people used it but two days ago the verge found it and published this now i havent been able to connect everytime i try way to bring it to niantics attention so that it got shut down verge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,about time get on them cheaters niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,even worse my weekend starts now from sunday to tuesday was planning a trip a couple hours away to go camping and pokemon hunting without pokevision there are no guarantees for the nestspokemon etc i was going to get bummer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had spent money on the game i live on the edge of somewhere so not a lot going on out here i used the ingress maps to find portalsgyms and pokevision to find mons since theres nothing worthwhile in my neighborhood pokevision was a great way for me to plan where i was going to go since im limited to mostly being home due to medical issues and always needing a ride places i could plan out a hour adventure and go home and do this once or twice a week now im going pretty much blind places and it sucks to get somewhere and find that theres nothing good there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still have not got an answer to this yet how is pokevision fun it tells you where a pokemon is and you rush there and you get a new mon or something rare you had before absolutely no tracking or hunting required except being fast if its far away how is it fun to know where something is when the incentive is to hunt and trackaka triangulate if it would work i understand that the lack of tracking ingame is horrible but how are more or less cheating tools fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what are your scans
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,some people on the front page talking about more spawing rare pokemon in rural areas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont get it cant you just get your driver to drop you off at a place with multiple lures pokevision helps with finding rare pokemons or was your driver driving you around the city so you can catch rare pokemons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how is a broken nearby list and no way of tracking pokemon fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heres a well written description by someone else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i cant understand the logic man the people on earth today are part of an instantgratification nightmare personally i find it way more exciting to run into a rare pokemon randomly these guys who think pinpoint accuracy is somehow not cheating blow my mind
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that doesnt answer my question i never said that the lack of tracking is fun still i miss the fun of knowing where everything is it kills the incentive of pogo just as much as the lack of the step feature imo and all i get as answers is like yours which does not answer anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,best quote of the post andreessen horowitz one of the most respected venture capital firms in existance investors in many of the largest startup companies you use every day commented on this earlier this week in their podcast about pokemon go they mentioned that niantic needs to take note from all the many of dedicated fans spending huge amounts of hours building tools to fill in the gaps in their own offerings this is an entrepreneurial dream a fanbase literally showing them what they want built they said that it would be to their detriment to ignore those fans or treat them like theyre doing something wrong
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it says the map made the game fun again thats about it i still fail to see any reasoning people made apps which replace the tracking tool nealry still using the same api technology i guess i have no idea so why are people not using this instead of pinpoint accuracy maps as i said before i can understand that the broken feature ruins the game somehow but the reasoning why cheating is fun is lacking its just a more efficient way to get over with the game hooray on you a fanbase literally showing them what they want built yeah go on niantic give us a map with all spawn locations and timers world wide thats what we want apparently please i just want to understand repeating its fun doesnt do any good i have a functioning brain i wont repeat it after hearing it a million times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the problem is we have zero tracking ability now if something pops up as being nearby it could be anywhere from feet away to what feels like if they brought back some sort of tracking ability it wouldnt be a problem but as it is it ruins the game for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have fun collecting different pokemon calculating their ivs and evolving them hoping for the best moveset theres a lot more to the game than tracking and while it did provide some fun for me walking around aimlessly in a suburban area removes all the fun for me rather than just the tracking aspect hence i used pokevision in order to bypass the bugged and impossible to use in game tracking in order to continue with the rest of the fun i had in the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre real fun at parties well if you ever got invited to one maybe but seriously living in the burbs and working in a major city catching a million pidgeys rattatas zubats weedles and drowzees is just boring after about minutes with pokevision etc you are hunting electronically first then going out in the real world hoping to find it or track it down just because its playing differently than how youd like who cares its a game let others play how theyd like frankly this is less cheating than the guide books of past i just want my gyarados dragonite and a couple more eeveeseeveelutions and using the trackers was the only way i have been able to locate them in my region
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,picture this it is you are playing pokemon red on gameboy you dont have a tracker you walk your avatar through tall grass or distant locations and cross your fingers you find something amazing most of the time it is pidgeys and rattatas but when you finally come across that growlithe or snorlax it is an amazing feeling of accomplishment now apply that logic to pokemon go and youll see where my game perspective comes from rare pokemon should be rare and discovered by not only persistence but a little chance and luck that way when you do see them in a gym there is a sense of awe involved
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but we could just wait til they fix it you do now what you could ve done in the future with a hopefully working tracking tool isnt that like killing the game long term for you when you are done with your optimized pokemon and the game gets fixed by then you have no incentive anymore to play the game when its in its supposedly state edit i guess you can hope for future content ie more generations where you then can play properly so i have to take that into account with my thoughts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you live in the suburbs does pokevision really help all the competitive rare pokemons are gonna be in cities
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so basically you are just playing a completely different game and i let you play how you want i dont know if you misread me on purpose or ignore me i just wanted to understand all i get is passive aggressiveness if anything at all good for you when you have fun playing with you im just not on the same boat then at least we still downvote people with different opinions than actually discussing over here considering the split of answersvoting thanks for your input anyway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think the key difference is in the gameboy games there is no cost or difficulty in walking for hours hoping for a rare encounter in real life there is a definite cost and difficulty because it costs time and money gas for example not only to go somewhere but also in opportunity cost i dont want to go to different parts of la especially with traffic for hours on end with nothing to show for it when i could be doing a million other things with bettermore productive results and ive lived in la for years theres not a whole lot of new things for me to see its even worse for people who dont have a lot of time because of school kids work or some combination thereof im more interested in nestsrare spawns in other parts of the la area so i know where i might want to go and not waste my time its about planning a day trip really i dont use pokevision or other maps for things immediately around me unless there is either a time restraint or physical barrier places like the santa monica pier are fun regardless no pokevision needed hell even without pogo santa monica is fun lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,except in the old pokemon games you have a small area where pokemon were going to show up you could literally walk in a circle and get something to pop up with pogo its a vastly bigger scale to try and search for pokemon pokemon that have short spawn rates so it becomes problematic trying to hunt it down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but at least in the original games you knew where certain pokemon would spawn so you could share that information with your friends if i want an abra in the original i know that i can find them on a certain route it may take some time but theyre there i dont think rare pokemon should be everywhere but you should at least have a chance to find pokemon if they show up on your radar something like pokevision may not be the answer but at least of the fun with pokemon go is catching them all without anyway to know where to find certain pokemon i might as well give up playing all together since i dont like battling for gyms and you cant trade yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id argue its more valuable in the suburbs because of this partly because lures and rare pokemon are easier to come by in the city one has the ability to walk around aimlessly and still have a chance to encounter a rare pokémon with pokevision in suburban areas we have the ability to encounter pokemon not rare pokemon but pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont know if i agree with your logic you arent forced to drive anywhere and if you do decide to drive somewhere you are likely to go to a park or reserve and have other plans while you do so if youre going out to just play pokemon go and you have to be efficient then i dont know if that is the correct attitude
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see no problem with that as i feel it makes the experience more authentic and toward what they were trying to accomplish the good news is the game is still new and has time to grow so we can be patient and accept it as it is for now or walk away from it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are absolutely correct personally i think we should be patient for niantics solution instead of giving them the middle finger and making our own which violate their tos i definitely get where you are coming from though either way vote with your wallettime
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i admit that i have a problem i encounter with a variety of things i feel like i have to master the system and be efficient thats why i dont do fantasy football anymore because it became an obsession and took too much time and all of the enjoyment out of my sundays i am encountering that same issue with pogo at times its something im trying to work on and maybe the loss of pogo maps will help who knows but i agree with your comment below patience towards the small team at niantic is prudent right now those are the two things im lacking right now in my life that i need to fix patience and realizing that inefficiency is not necessarily a bad thing its hard to explain to an internet stranger but thats actually a really hard thing to let go of for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my best friend is the same and so was i until about a a year ago ive tried to learn how to relax more and take life as it comes because it was causing me stress and anxiety and i came to realize i wasnt enjoying gaming as much as i used to i was also like that in the workplace and realized my coworkers saw me as anal instead of what i thought i was efficient probably too much info but there it is im still kinda bad sitting at parks at in my car catching mons i think that you understand it is a problem is a good thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,could be related to the memory leak issue with gyms currently pokemon gos ram usage increases with every gym visit until it just straight up crashes see if restarting the app every now and then helps at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is youre phone getting hot mine gets hot and makes everything lag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,two words bubble strat instant fix its how the game was meant to be played pokemons creator satoshi tajiri envisioned these epic diglett vs horsea battles at the very beginning and its amazing to see it come to fruition
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had this happen though with no recaptcha i had to restart my phone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did you trying turning it off and turning it on again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,strange got another captchas now its working again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep restarted the app relogged in and restarted phone still nothing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,keep doing it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine sucked caught over pokémon with no ditto kept my evolves for the last day and waited too long and the event ended
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,did one lucky egg mass evolve had another one lined up and totally dropped the ball and forgot what the date was hunting for ditto catching pidgey and rattata was a lot of fun and a really smart way to reduce some of the monotony of catching the commons have only come across two ditto so far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got exactly dust pokemon stops jumped to level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got a ton of stardust finally leveled up to and got a ditto could have been worse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did million xp went from into to into i also got like dust and a shitload of stops this was a good event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got to level and am halfway to level the extra stardust was also great of course i did catch two ditto but one was right after the event ended im just thankful they ran the event during the holiday weekend my birthday was on friday so i got to play a ton on that day as well as the entire weekend
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got my ditto and powered up from and a bit to almost
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,xp around stardust did lucky eggs in total but i almost did not play for days of the event
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dust considering i had zero before the event big win
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i only had time to go out for hours each day but i managed to level up from level with exp to level with exp hatched my first lapras and my first chansey im now sitting at in my pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same i have like rattatat candies and over pidgey candies i prolly woukd have gotten pretty close to if i didnt stall i went from from using lucky eggs while walking around hatching eggs and catching everything in sight each catch would be like xp it was crazy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,congrats i think i did almost the same as you i was to lvl and now im into level about stardust dont know about pokemons but i feel its pretty similar as well i focused mostly on lucky egg mass evolves and managed to do every day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks i had a few days where i could do thing is i got to in days and then i was like oh million lets slow down but then after a few days i noticed that xp kept on flowing so i started working a bit harder again i couldve done more but i kinda like it that i got a nice goal again xp in a few weeks should be doable without tryharding oh and btw i maxed a iv ditto haha its at cp now such fun doing gym battles with him haha tried him out on a dragonite and he got to cp immediately lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will try that to level up my ditto as well eventualy im still pissed about gym changes so i dont spend any stardust away from mullion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that sure is alot and thats also why i leveled him up ditto brings fun and thats what im aiming for in this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think it pretty much works like this if a charge move available toss a coin if its heads use the charge move otherwise use the quick move
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely have seen varying routines even among the same species of pokemon with the same moveset mostly with and bar charge moves where sometimes it is used at the same interval throughout a match and sometimes back to back in addition only a few times out of about gym battles and not very recently somehow it was possible to faint a pokemon with a one bar charge move without a successful use of the move ever going off the instance that comes to mind was an enemy gary with hp a few times spamming fast attack with a vaporeon resulted in the charge move not being used at all or not going off before faint may have been a bug but any pokemon with a slower fast attack than vape or if there was a pause to use a friendly charge move the hp would go off as expected in any case it certainly seems like more than one pattern is possible based on some unknown factor
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive fought the same pokemon in a gym in backtoback battles and noticed the same pokemon were following a different ai pattern either using the charge move earlier or using both in sequence a little later i have only been able to notice those two broad trends of ai in my fights and there doesnt seem to be any rhyme or reason which will be assigned during a particular fight at least none that ive noticed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i believe this is actually a hypothesis and im not just being pedantic because youre bragging about taking down instinct gyms but to be seriousthat is kind of interesting and fairly hard to prove affirmatively since every time you test it you edge closer to knocking that defender out of the gym so youre limited in terms of how many tests you can run the one thing im curious about isif its not truly random what affects it would species affect it that is if you used a venusaur for example against vaporeon would it behave differently would skills affect it if your lapras had ice shard would the dragonites behave differently would level affect it if you powered up your lapras a little would the first dragonite be a little more aggressive with dragon claw would stats affect it you have two slightly different statwise jolteons what if you used the against the vaporeon and the against the gyarados would the pokemons id affect it at all lets say you evolved and leveled a completely identical cp jolteon stats and skills and used it against that gyarados would it still behave the same way thats four five variables i just thought of that youd need to control for for what its worth im pretty sure everyones right and its purely random occams razor after all but
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are definitely on to something i have seen similar patterns i think most of it depends on how much damage you are doingenergy they are gaining over time it seems obvious but i rarely see one bar charge moves used in the first seconds of a battle regardless of how much damage the defender has taken and their ability to use the charge move charges move use does seem to associate with remaining health in a lot of situations good observations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive noticed that when a charge move happens depends on your fighting style if im spamming through the quick moves then the charge moves come at a different time than if i am dodging the quick moves using same defender and attacker more research is needed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my beleif albieit unproven is that this is where size comes into play a extra large mon to me can rattle off charge moves more frequently than a scrawny one wish i could prove this i have a colossal hbbs snorlax and a wgat vape that i prestige against the vaporon let loose back to back aqua tails while prestiging one time couldnt slip in a charge move all the mons i have with a battles won count are xtra large thats just my unproven theory thou
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah its chance of using it once it has a bar its obvious to anyone who fights gyms enough that defenders dont always do the same thing you can go an entire battle without the gyarados even trying to do a single hydro pump op is making stuff up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats what ive always heard as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i have fought countless of the most used pokemon there is no pattern i guess there is a to use its charge move in every turn if it has enough energy meaning that if u are super lucky no pokemon will ever use charge attacks on you xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,op is making stuff up a couple of level instinct gyms i think this statement is a dead giveaway
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perhaps in the case which i was referring to the gary was fought with the same vape hp was not used except in the second battle when i paused to finish it off with a charge move on a subsequent battle with another attacker it used hp as per usual it certainly did not seem random or even close this particular gary could use hp up to three times normally but if only water gun was used with no delays in attack commands it would never use its charge move even once this was reproduceable over multiple battles could have just been a glitch this was sometime before the xmas update iirc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,looks like weve got a comedian over here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well it just makes me wonder a lot i have prestiged many high level gyms to get them even higher and put my pokemon in there meaning i need to gith many times the same pokemon vapes or dragonites or any other pokemon there seem to be so random that in one prestige roll the same vape would use pulse so much it was literally almost like fast attack on other rolls it would use only one or two well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,using your charge seems to bait the enemy ais special so i use a technique called charge canceling to bait the enemy charge move and safely punish
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill show myself out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true though factors such as damage output damage received etc can affect energy accumulation and with plus attack cool down this can cause strange patterns
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they would still never be used gyms are just a time investment the resource investment for most people is minimal if you fill a gym with alakazams that shot your pokemons itll still die way faster than a snorlax gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but not all pokemon are meant to be defenders some are pure attackers alakazam is a good example it ais a glass cannon its used as a sweeper alakazam isnt meant to take a hit its high speed and high sp attack mean it usually hits first and hard i know pogo is different but it just wouldnt be right if pokemon like alakazam were good defenders
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i prefer increase per stat atk def hp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes but it will kill ur pokemon people will use that more since snorlax wastes time but doesnt hurt resources at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a variety of pokemon in this game should be viable defenders not just ones with high hp thats so limiting and boring
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not a chance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do remember they are known for giving a server side update after big updates like the recent ones then big things suddenly appear in the game because of the ground work put into the client side update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think the announcement was early the update hasnt even arrived for ios yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,with niantic anything is possible it seems
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,valentines event and then gen in march are whats on deck i suspect no point focusing on this daily hope im wrong of course
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic is a sack of surprises a smelly smelly sack of surprises
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you think we can
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not all updates are major updates in fact most arent why weeks though releases are every weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hope we get an update and bug fix tried it today and the app crashed every time i clicked on a pokemon with ar mode on of course you cant turn off ar mode unless you engage a pokemon so i couldnt play the game until i reverted to earlier version
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill try and be the one supportive guy that can relate because it is tiring to play and hope for better during this dry period all we can do is hope
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,unlikely at this point st valentine is the next upcoming potential event so i doubt theyd release an additional serversided update until then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think youre right i remember the update where they implemented the buddy system the announcement came on saturday or sunday and ive checked the app store almost every minute at least but it was there on tuesday for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,which means if the apple watch workout stopping issues havent been fixed were stuck with that for the next couple of weeks definitely giving up hope on this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and dont forget with niantic nothing is possible too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,typically in the middle of the week and this one came right at the start of the week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aww just cause apple watch functionality is buggy p did you update aw to i read elsewhere that it improved the experience for pokemon go the new update might have other improvements as well they never provide a full list of changes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,havent actually tried since the update might give it a shot on my lunch break and see how it goes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,most charge moves have a noticeable delay before the dodge window shows up yellow flash around the outside of the screen against a vaporeon it there will be a steady flash every time it uses water gun right after water gun finishes it will usually flinch from your hits when it doesnt attack or flinch you know a charge attack is coming it will look like lag as if the pokemon is just standing there doing nothing that should be your cue to stop attacking and get ready to dodge body slam seed bomb and dragon claw are the common ones that come out fast enough you may miss the dodge chance most other moves have a solid second delay before dodge time that should give you the animation cue standing still that its coming
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup its a known issue thats been around for quite a while one way to deal with it is to learn the subtle animation differences between various attacks sometimes you can tell that a charge attack is starting because the attackers animation is different enough from the normal one another way is to learn roughly how many attacks you can make before the defender is likely to start using charge moves once youve made about that many attacks start dodging their quick moves keep attacking between the enemys quick moves and dodging with the rhythm until the charge attack happens then go back to fullaggro attacking as fast as you can
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep its annoying just get used to the timing of it you can usually see the change in the defenders animation once they stop flinching from your attacks the charge move is coming but regardless of the message you can always see the yellow flash white lines myself i look for the lines since the yellow doesnt show up all that well to my eyes particularly with moves whose animation covers a lot of the screen such as blizzard the radial white lines are quite obvious once you start looking for them unless it lags at just the right time and skips the frames with the flash lines happens more often than youd think
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a loooooongstanding bug same with not effective message both override the charge move notification sometimes making it appear after the charge move already fired there is no known workaround you just have to either watch for the change in the animation or for the pause between animations as the charge attack has a longer wind up time for faster charge moves you just have to dodge every move no way around it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats why i prefer attacking vaporeons with dragonite rather than se counters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they should priorityze attack from enemy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure i understand you completely i presume by slowbuilding you mean moves where the dodge window appears late after initiation because hydro pump falls into this category for hydro pump and other similar moves an effective tell is when there is a longer duration than normal between attacks this is your cue to be wary and look to dodge the next attack alternative means are to look for animation changes though im not certain that this works for everything and it may not give you much warning and if you have sound on apparently different attacks have different sounds finally as a last resort you have two additional options dodge everything or use a pokemon that doesnt do super effective damage eg wigglytuff and alakazam on most pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,learn your weave pattern for the common pokemon for example jolteon vs hydro pump vaporeon three hits pause yellow flash dodge three hits pause yellow flash dodge three hits pause vaporeon isnt attacking one more hit pause yellow flash dodge thunder just takes practice i guess but i just wait for yellow flashes dont be overzealous with your attacks one or two hits inbetween dodges is plenty if youre trying to conserve potions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my only advice is to get used to dodging everything if youre up against a defender with an annoying spammable charge attack but yeah really surprised nothings been done about this yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use a rhythm method counting between quick attacks mean i can dodge almost everything if i want its not perfect but since i dodge everything most times its really easy to pick out the charge moves ive also memorized how many quick attacks i can sneak in between seeing the charge coming and actually having to dodge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think if you had sound on you could hear the move coming
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you get used to dodging every attack youll notice there is a definite rhythm to it maybe one to three attacks by you and then a dodge and repeat there is a much longer delay before the charge attack so if you dodge and they dont attack just wait for the flash and dodge the charge attack instead
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,watch for posture of the defending pokémon that is a pokémon will straighten up before using its charge move you can also count quick attacks or look at the battle clock to get a rough idea of when the next charge move will come
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i stopped relying on that ages ago you have be aware of the time between their attacks eventually it becomes intuitive though not infallible i should say but the vast majority of charge moves i dodge without looking for any messages
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like to use attackers with neutral quick moves like bite the small loss of damage from stab is easily made up by the fact that i do never get a hydro pump to the face
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youre pecking at your screen as fast as you can to spam as quickly as possible thats a big part of the problem tap once per attack near the end of your current one youll have much better control over your pokemon this way and you give up nothing in terms of damage since youre still preloading your next attack all of those other taps are doing nothing for you except burning a couple of calories learn the tells signs that the enemy is about to use a specific attack and keep a rough idea of how many attacks theyve used since their last charge attack if its been seconds since snorlax sent a hyper beam your way another will be coming shortly example your vine whip grass type vs vaporeon dodge the first two attacks get in a fast attack or two then dodge the third keep a mental note of the time between the third and fourth attack thats the pattern youre looking for get into a rhythm of attackingdodging ie whips in between water gun attacks whether or not youre dodging them that part is up to you i find it helps to keep a rhythm going in longer fights the moment you notice that vaporeon is just standing still instead of attacking at his usual time you know a charge is coming stop attacking and within about a half a second or so hell start showing his attack animation a yellow flash should soon follow and you will be ready for an easy dodge dodge it then head back into your attackdodge rotation send a few more petal blizzards his way and youll soon be on to the next defender without unnecessary hp loss
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just got used to most standard battle timings onebar moves will fire no earlier than on the clock assuming a standard fight no overflow energy if you open a fight with a hydro pump for instance it might be more like but you can usually rush your own onebar move before the enemy gets to use theirs tip keep an eye on the attack frequentcy of the enemy if they pause inordinately long get ready to dodge tip recognize your own attackers flexibility if youre using water gun you have a lot of freedom to dodge anything in between attacks if you are using confusion you may want to wait until the end of the last animation to buffer your next move and be mindful of clock time to determine how safe each move should be tip practice weaving attacking full speed and dodging every attack in between get used to different rhythms of different enemies and your own types attack rhythms tip just do more gyms youll pick up on these things smash gyms for fun for coins any reason you can think of just smash them more often and youll start to develop habits that maximize your gameplay and dps outputdamage mitigation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea this has always been a thing its because the messages share the same space since your quick attacks are coming in at a constant rate the prompt is flooded with super effective messages because the text is displayed for a duration before it fades it lingers during the enemy charge attack then after the charge attack is over it will display that the enemy is charging sometimes suggestions they can either shorten the delay that the text is displayed for prioritize charge attack messages in the prompt convert the super effective damage to a flinch animation or some little icon the icon could be stationarystatic or animated or they could add a separate prompt specifically for charge attacks kind of like how the beginning of the match says go have charge attack info appear in the middle of the screen in bold letters any one of those suggestions would improve the situation and i am sure theres many other ways they could improve it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is it me or every one of the people that posted here doesnt know about the yellow flash before any attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe you should learn how to actually dodge attacks dont need a system message for that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty much this comment when youre battling him you get a feel how long it takes for an opponent to use a fast move and when theres a noticeable delay in the next attack you know its coming up and wait an extra seconds before the yellow flash or sometimes longer depending on the attack
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this helped me a lot thank you for sharing your insight
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also one of the reasons why i prefer poison quick attacks on my victreebellsvileplumes ill trade the se damage to avoid an untimely hydro pump to the face
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,great now i cant fight gyarados without sound on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty sure most people mentioned the yellow flash thanks for a useful comment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are a salty little troll arent you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not salty but if you look at comments they all talk about how to dodge based on feeling rythm or animations when those are completely innacurate i mean you can literally dodge everything even with of the screen turned off you just need the bottom to see the yellow flash we are months into the game how can ppl still not know that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,uhhh i dont think you understand this post at all or the best attacking methods dodging every single attack is just not efficient at all we are all aware of the yellow flash however the yellow flash is not an indicator on when an opponents charge attack is coming its there to tell you when exactly to dodge but if you are attacking when you see the yellow flash you are gonna get hit this post is about identifying when a charge attack is coming when you cant see the dialogue message prompt due to the super effective message delay bug some charge moves are easy to identify regardless however some moves are very quick and hard to see ie hydro pump body slam dragon claw all these people did was help give pointers to counter that bug reread the op
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,currently sitting on but im tempted to spend on that kingler i got today
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,someone in our group had million a few months back peopleve said that they have even more than that on here before which id believe i have right now but ive had over a million before feels good to spend it all powering up pokemon that are worth powering up though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent played in months and im at
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres several prominent level players in sydney that are racing to million stardust my friend is currently sitting on about million stardust and is kicking himself for getting suckered into this competition because grinding stardust all day every day is really not enjoyable haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im at at trainer lvl really just trying to get to then maybe cap out a few ive been waiting on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i reached million stardust last week i powered up all my top defenders and still have a million stardust its not hard when you reach higher levels and there is more time to build stardust before leveling up as well as collecting from eggs and gyms i am saving all this stardust to quickly power up gen pokes when they are released
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been spending all my dust powering up my gym team recently right now i have more eevee candy than i have stardust which is at about right now sad times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,proof
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it wont even make a dent in your stash do it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is the new kingler not counting japan guys alleged unless he posts on his behalf anyone here have
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the limiting factors at this point are candy and caring enough to actually spend it i already have a murderers row of gym killers so i dont really need to power anything up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i imagine ill eventually get enough coins where its not even worth opening the app to collect the daily gym coins anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hey i recognise your username i see you putting lures at cq all the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats kinda where im at right now closing in on lvl but its like whats the point i might try for medals but pikachu ice and steel are impossible for the time being i did get a pogo recently and it does make it easier to grind wo trying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im currently spending it as it comes in and was down to last night
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats light weight theres a dude in japan with million xp and over million stardust hes also maxed out a ton of pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me too and pokemon that i havent seen in levels cause theyre living at a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,japan
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,😵😵😵😵😵😵
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i put my first dragonite in the gym at my church the day i evolved him hes been in bible school purgatory for months now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol defeated
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,where in texas is this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not even mad i knew theres got to be multimillionaires chilling on the road
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,waco tx
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what are you saving the stardust for what does your top mons look like
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im in san antonio we dont have that kind of gym stagnation here what team are you im mystic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont really have it earmarked for anything in particular i just dont have anything worth powering up i generally just power up a couple times so i have the top mon in the gym other than that its not worth it unless its got great ivs moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the brazos river runs red with the blood of fallen mystic gyms what is red may never die
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,weve removed this thread as it doesnt follow our community posting guidelines see the sidebar it looks like the conversation is happening just fine in another subreddit well let it stay there cheers dronpes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty accurate depiction of the game state as it is right now sad but true tldr op is infuriated because niantic hasnt listened to the community at all he refers that pokemon go as it stands in the current beta phase is no more than ingress with a pokemon theme and useless portals gyms a secondary point also being that the game steers away from everything pokemon has always been about forging a bond with your pokemon raising them and battling other people pogo has nothing of that right now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,please get this shit thread off tsr this user has a few valid complaints but overdramatizes the situation and makes it seem a lot worse than it is as if we should take anything this kid says seriously after that edgy title haha in the comments he claims to have knowledge of how game development works and ends up looking like a little kid idealizing game development he insults one of the mods that knows a hell of a lot more than most of us do about niantic a few times including a stupid immature response to something he apparently couldnt come up with an actual response to we dont need entitled little assholes like that in this community if he wouldnt have sensationalized everything and just brought up valid points of contention niantic doesnt communicate with us at all when it comes to development for example is a fine complaint then i wouldve been totally fine with the thread
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lets be honest it cant and never could be the mainline title we wanted it to be im pretty sure that would be pokemon conintendo blatantly shooting itself in the foot and totally devaluing future projects like sumo and beyond niantic was tasked with making a different kind of game that could hopefully grow they couldnt just take all of the core gameplay and add more stuff because that is very much infringing on the main line the question about this is can anyone else find a way to meet all these fan wants while not using any of the core systems i ask that literally id personally love to hear ways to fix the game within these confines rather than just hearing that the game is broken
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will say what i said in the other thread they dont owe you anything stow your fanboy entitlement they are make a game to be played on a different system they wont make a pokemon game for a mobile device just like the nintendo ones that would be nintendo shooting its self in the foot secondly saying the game is almost ready is a bad logical argument a lot of things can change between now and release
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do we need to remind ourselves that the pokemon fanbase while huge mainly consists of year olds we may just have to accept that niantic isnt making a game for us they may just be borrowing the title pokemon which had an appeal on young ones in the past us and targeting the fresh generation of every young person with a smartphone they probably need a wider reach than they had with ingress since mainly adults play that and most of the adult population is too busy as it is children may very look like the perfect audience from their standpoint see me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get annoyed by comments like that of this op its okay that niantic tpc and nintendo have decided to take a different approach to gaming otherwise what real difference would there be from pogo and the coming release of sun and moon for those complaining about not having insert feature or its stupid that you cant insert function shut up and wait for sun and moon the rest of us that can see past what isnt there and can appreciate what is will find ways to enjoy this app for what it is and not cry about what it isnt pleasestoptheincessantcrying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,oh sorry shouldve read the guidelines
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel that the secondary point is something very valid to be upset about despite the fact some folks are downplaying and dismissing it as silly pokemon as a gaming franchise both in the side games and main games has always encouraged you to grow attached to your little piece of data to feel like your party members are unique and special and that they have grown based on your efforts in the game to train and teach them to not give us a mechanic that fulfills this at all in a game with a trailer like the one they put out is quite frankly a really bad move especially given the media blind and lack of official information theyve put out since that trailer even now nonbeta testers dont have a whole heck of a lot to go on aside from secondhand leak details of course people like me who are longterm fans and took that trailer as having any basis in the actual product are going to feel disappointed its kind of natural innit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not sure what fanboy entitlement youre referring to but insulting people is not a good way to get them to take your point of view or arguments seriously
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and a lot can even change after the game is released there have been so many changes to ingress just in the year and a half that ive been playing its a different kind of game than the base games there are going to be drastic differences well just have to be patient and see what they do plus its free
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really disagree with you it starts when we watch the official trailer we see lots of grown people we may not have all the time to walk and this is where they are going to make money im pretty prepared to spend money to make my trainer life easier and do not have to walk kilometers just for some potions and other stuff children will not have an adult mobility too i dont think that they are targeting exclusively children and teens as you said to enjoy this game in its full potential you should be an adult with a little money and a car to make things easy depending where you live of course
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think you are close to the right idea it is not a game for pokemon fanboys it is a game that will build of the pokemon fanbase it is not meant to be a copy of nintendo games its an adventure into a new realm and of course it is a nianticingress focus they have more to gain from it all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no worries friend thanks for understanding
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,am i the only person whos never really grown attached to a pokemon and just held preferences over looks and movesets
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed opening the entire post with they dont owe you anything stow your fanboy entitlement is definitely not the way to get people to even finish reading a post that said they kinda do owe the players everything without the players they have no game without a game they have no company and no income companies dont become successful by not listening to there customers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seen seen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your subreddit your rules
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,new york behold my safari zone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait theyre comingtoday
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does anyone know how many invites they will be sending out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just to be clear if you do get an invite i believe even saying you are in the test might be a breech of the nda so if your usernames are associated reddit pokemon go you might get caught and banned like mine if i get an invite i will not be saying anything just a heads up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,chicago checking in i live in the city work in the burbs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,anyone else feel like niantic is just trolling its getting pretty late in the day est
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got at least one in colorado and it wasnt meeee cries to death
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what time will they start sending emails or have they started already
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got my invite around cst went out and caught pokemon skans rattata and psyduck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im in maine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,south phoenix az checking in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just want someone to get a beta invite so i know if i should give up hope or not but right now its killing me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think they came but i havent seen anyone on the sr that confirmed they got into a beta so far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah but in san diego we have an actual safari park d httpsoulofamericacomsoagalleriessandfamattrsdsafariparkaerialjpg
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,new york probably only has grass and water types anyway im not jealous or anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ios i believe is limited to only unknown for android theyre limited on ios because only one app allows to send invites and its limit is recipients android ive heard etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually this is a common misconception most beta test ndas say nothing about telling others about being in them i say most so either read the nda to make sure or say nothing at all
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i reviewed what they sent me they talk about not sharing gameplay or content but nothing about saying whether or not you got in so im assuming thats okay until explicitly stated otherwise i assume that while they dont want gameplay to be released they do want hype
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really even just saying i got in seems a little over the top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so what youre saying is you arent telling us that you got in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when are they supposed to be sent out eastern
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well they could be basing it off of pdt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me neither 😥😥
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well knowing person got it doesnt mean anything theyre sent in waves so person might get it today and another gets it tomorrow
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,praise arceus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive done a few beta tests ive not seen one that forbids someone from speaking about being involved they are very explicit about what you can or cannot say about gameplay etc but it isnt james bond stuff til this subreddits modbot has a language filter that doesnt like common phrases
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its actually pretty typical in ndas for closed betas and such it is more of a technicality then anything else but just be aware
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,unknown today is the only thing we know
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,praise helix
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in the fable legends one when it was a thing they were fine with sharing screenshots as long as they were purely on the character they get pissed if its gameplay or anything else and didnt care if you bragged about being in it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive done close to probably im old and the only one i was told not to was guild wars early alpha i did
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess i wont say anything if i get in i dont wanna get banned
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wot im not asking who is it just when they are supposed to be sent out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,praise the epic karp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,praiseit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or just say im not in the beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,today
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,praise the dome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just say i am required to say that i am not in the beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,slow claps thanks for the tons of help good job channeling your inner smartass
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perfect
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just bough this my self
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you practically cant go wrong with anything anker read the reviews and descriptions some dont work for iphone for example due to the current output
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just wondering but are some of the lower end battery recharger devices also bad for your own phones battery like would the phone battery end up depleting quicker over time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they have good anker battery packs for like ten or fifteen bucks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id be careful when you pick the battery pack my current one melted the plastic on my usb lead and burnt out the inside this was just over a year after purchase so wasnt covered by any warranty just make sure it has a load of good reviews and you should be good a high mah number is good too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what about this one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the battery pack i have for my phone is a halo i payed for it ive never had any problems with it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i bought a team mystic branded pokemon go charger its not the biggest charger by any means but gets a full charge out of my iphone and is much smaller and lighter than my one theyre out of stock at the moment but im sure theyll be back httpwwwgochargecoukproductteammysticpokemongocharger
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,amazon basics i have never been an issue edit link
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats a nice charger thx for recommendation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i bought this one a while ago and i can confirm its really good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn thats pricey for what you get i bought this and i get four or five iphone charges out of it before it even shows a low battery signal ive been using it for a couple months now and i love it never leave home without it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont have iphone so no problem and thx for recommendation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nah it wont harm your phone but i can only advice against cheap battery packs from china tested it when i started playing ingress almost a year ago problem is not that these cheap chinese battery packs wouldnt deliver the power they advertise but the problem is really really poor quality of the casing long story short within two weeks of active usage the usbport in the battery pack broke so only the ampere port is still intact which isnt enough to play with maximum display brightness on a sunny day paid bucks for this learning experience bought an anker later and the quality of the plastic casing is really really huge
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah im just looking at them they are preety good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ok thx for the tip
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,awesome one i might buy that one thank you for the link
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thx for recommendation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got the amazon basics it works well and i could probably bludgeon a mugger to death with it if i had to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah interesting i believe mine is or called powerseed i was wondering because if the longevity of my phone battery would be compromised either sort of by the external battery sort of frying it or some other form of depletion im no science buff though so figured id ask thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i own this battery and its awesome highly recommend it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,after some research i bought this set i have a samsung edge that has a battery in it according to some redditors that played the beta and had a samsung edge i can play hours that means with the anker i can fully charge it times to hours of play time the is good too if you have an older phone with a less powerful battery
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dear arceus please have mercy on me i know i havent been talking to you as much as i should if you can do this one thing just this one thing ill be a better person ill donate to all the pokemon centers ill stop objectifying misty and ill stop using my lickitung for well you know amen refreshes gmail damn you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ios user here anxiously waiting and pleading for a noningress niantic email to appear in my inbox
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fyi ios users the tests are being distributed using apples testflight program so its limited to emailstesters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really hope invites go out for people who didnt play ingress completely not fair for those of us who want to play pokemon go because were pokemon fans and dont care at all about ingress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are still login issues from ios as of cst edit login issues resolved as of cst
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sure us android users will come soon ios ingress players had to suffer for years without a port we owe them an hour at least
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at this point im not sure what will make my day more getting the pokemon go beta invite or hearing back from this girl im super into
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic hasnt said anything about the emails being released yet so im hoping for the best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,none here either would so love to test this but i guess i might have to wait on ios no email sad face
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,checks email nothing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,re final edit tt there goes my chance ive been working on ingress for a while but am still only
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,will i get an email telling me i didnt get in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent gotten my email yet anybody else not get one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,another user here that has the unable to authenticate error on android
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ingress player here like a lot of you can anyone confirm that they gave beta codes to anyone below level ive had ingress since beta and im level currently although im a really active player since the last months or so signed up for the go beta the day it opened and i havent heard a single thing not even a confirmation of applying which i would assume they would have sent i feel like they either have really dumb beta requirements or i just got the short end of the stick out of all ingress agents of my level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont tell me this i havent got anything yet oh please come soon delayed email please come
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no no no i didnt get it and i needed it so badlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy please email please come
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how can there be information from the silph twitter before any information is put out anywhere by niantic i think its a bs tweet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is killing me im ios and been playing the game since day one in the usa nearly years ago i want to be in the beta so badly and i havent gotten an email yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would be from testflight if you see niantic then youve just been trolled
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,having same problem got any tips
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,android here really dumb and error all the time finally got through to create my account and i finally got the email when i click on verify email it says there is no account even though i can log in online when i try to log in on the app it just says unable to authenticate please try again come on nintendo youre better than this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i completely agree
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah honestly if they really only let ingress players in it kinda puts a bad taste in my mouth towards niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are you all being serious right now theyre developers in the middle of developing a game you wont be playing anything youll be testing testing the quality of said product in development to make sure it works it wont be as fun as much as it will tedious with many data wipes along the way this testing includes current features and those yet to come being salty towards niantic says more about you than them i for one would prefer that they play it smart and allow experienced users of their previous title to steer the development of the game in the correct path why because those who arent fans will have a clear objective view of pokemon this will make sure that beneath the gimmick we all love itd actually be a fun gameand why the hell would you sign up if you didnt likelove pokemon furthermore its highly likely that at least some of the ingress players who got in are pokemon fans themselves and we can only hope they do right by us also its been confirmed that people whove signed up without an ingress account have gotten in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im sure android users will receive emails not too long from now its just im an android user and i want to know if im a beta tester and use it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hope so my texas relative lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hearing that the girl ur super into got the beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there are other girls out there this release will only happen once
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea i dont get it im sure we would hear something from niantic if it were true i think that tweet is a bs tweet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the emails might be sent out in batches not all at once or it might take longer for you to get your email over others keep up the hope
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nah man were just the unlucky ones hell all the ios users i know none of them made it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,udropes what say you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpsnianticlabscomblog niantic did confirm us beta test coming out soon and in the blog even said and today were expanding that field test to the united states to get more feedback to improve the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same （；・）
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep completely serious happy to test thats what a beta is saying having an ingress account is optional on the application and then giving the vast majority of invites to ingress players is incredibly disappointing people who didnt play ingress are more than capable of testing pokemon go and no being salty does not say more about me than niantics poor decision making but making that accusation makes you a jerk so thanks for that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,id take either one at this point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but its dangerous to go alone
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the anxiety level is over
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,may the glorious karp bless your soul for these comforting words
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also you should know this is only coming from the silphs twitter account ive not gotten any emails am an android user though and ive not seen any pictures this does void your beta tester contract or people saying that have got in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it has be someone claiming they got the email but actually didnt they probably pmd udronpes saying they got it and or sent a fake image to an email they received
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes but why would a tweet confirming the emails are going out come from the silph twitter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true maybe people taking advantage of the hype and sending in false reports maybe tt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well some people in the pokemongo subreddit seem to have gotten into the beta so there is your second piece of evidence
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,perhaps one of the admins of the silph road twitter has an iphone or maybe an iphone user pmd a sr mod with a valid emailimage pming the sr mods has reportedly been a super safe way to share leaks information and even images
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,while i do trust the siplh twitter account havent let me down yet i still havent gotten a second source and if highschool has taught me anything you need more than source
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen a few people over on the pokemongo reddit page posting about long in problems and a picture of an attachment
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the nest near me is currently a poliwag nest and it has two pokéstops and one gym its a park by a daycare and community center across the street from an elementary school
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a magmar nest nearby its a minipark with a swimming pool on one side and a hotel on the other also it has a monument related to wwii
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try to take a look at open source maps there seems to be a correlation for parks on osm and nest start with big parks and work through to smaller ones what is near by nests isnt too relevant to be fair
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,currently odiorne point near me is a onix nest the entire park within the dark green patch it used to be a magmar nest and before that a vulpix one its cool to take my casual friends there to get something they dont see often
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i know about osm but the idea is to minimize the number of possible canidates the reason for the post is to determine if nests are more likely to have x amount of pokestops and x amount of gyms or if nests require a minimum number of stopsgyms to happen i dont know that anyone has asked this question before so the relevancy has yet to be determined
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think there is a correlation unfortunately there are many nests in hong kong lets take large cluster spawn nests for example kowloon park pokestops gym kau sai chau golf course pokestops gyms both of these nests are huge with frequent spawns not to mention many smaller nests that have spawn point can have pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a week ago i was walking through a park transferring pokemon to make room in the box when i came across a magikarp on my list i thought it was weird because i normally transfer all magikarp i get right after i catch them i proceed to transfer this magikarp and continue cleaning out the box when i back out of the box a egg hatches but it freezes on the oh screen i restart the app check my recent list nothing in it that seems like it came from a egg then i check the journal turns out i hatched the magikarp while i was cleaning out my box he showed up in my list before i saw the egg hatch animation and i transferred him thats probably what caused the freezing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,filter to recent you hatch will be there also your jounal the hatch animation is just a big show you get the pokémon before i once evolved a pidgey before it hatched resulting in me hatching a pidgeotto
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no this happened to me too other people who are saying oh it will be there have not experienced what you and i have had happen i got the oh screen but could not click or progress past it when i restarted the game and checked my journal there was no new pokemon when i sorted my pokemon by recent there was nothing new i was annoyed but it was only a and it was only my permanent incubator so i didnt really lose anything but i had it happen again after i queued up about pokemon in incubators from and it happened again the game locked up and upon restarting there were no new pokemon in my inventory
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this happens if you transfer the hatched pokemon before the animation begins check your journal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not a bug you transfered the pokemon prior to the hatching animation it happened to me as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is exactly what happens just be careful when transferring and you wont run into the bug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,exact same thing happened to me and there were no additional candies added or magikarp added to the list
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same thing happened to me although mine didnt crash the game it just didnt show back up in my pokemon list i was confused for a second but then i saw three other new pokemon that i knew i didnt have before and sure enough i hatched each one of them once i backed out of the menu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,negative ive had a few where this was the case but i had eggs pop at the same time and the game hard crashed on the first oh splash screen closed and rebooted checked my recents and the most recent were a pidgey and a ratata those two definitely didnt come out of my eggs not sure what caused it was just walking around as usual i thought long and hard on what it was but i cant say i was doing anything unusual just unlucky its only ever happened once to me knock on wood
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i experienced the same thing egg oh freeze crash wait several minutes before restarting and got nothing the only possibility was that i hatched a rattata in my recent list but i know i caught that wonderous rat in the wild minutes ago along side my mom and sister no journal entry regarding egg hatch all those talking about being mistaken and missing the pokemon have not experienced this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when the brag is so strong you make a question and answer it yourself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you answered your own question
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i hit around stops today and got nothing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not sure ive gotten a lot of kings rocks but spun tons of stops if anything i think the items dropped more on gen launch day than any days after
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no items since event started also i didnt get one for day streak
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i got items over a five hour period made a post about it and nobody else seemed to have gotten lucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,didnt get anything on this day streak but did get two kings rocks within minutes of each other
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive gotten squat since the update so rng
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or is rngesus in my favor or do you just create the post to brag although you know the answer yourself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,besides the first day streak im my roommate loves to complain about my dex and how many gyms im able to hold its not all that impressive however hes played times with since drop im an avid daily player of course he has items to my item and ive played at least times as much rng is a bish
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just got a double drop on one stop spin of a sun stone and upgrade
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulba always bulba
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,arrrrg i havent decided yet hope im not late and get stuck with a pikachu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulb is love bulb is life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish they would let us choose any common pokémon to start with i want to be joey and start off with and only have a rattata it will be in the top percentage or rattata of the traditional starters though im team blue id pick bulbasaur no in the dex no in my heart ∩╹□╹∩
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,always always squirtle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charmander always been a fire girl not gonna change now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,either bulbasaur or squirtle i like bulbasaur more but i like squirtles evolutions more hmmhmm
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when i was much younger id always pick bulbasaur and call it coolboy to this day im not sure why xd but i switched to charmander later on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulbasaur im sure i can find a bunch considering the places near me and ill get a strong pokemon fast this way then the other two can come next leveling at a slower pace
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im gonna go stomping round sherwood forest with a charmander of course
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im personally going for squirtle since i live far from a mass of water
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,squirtle im guessing for the first few days pretty much every gym will be packed with charmanders might as well get a head start
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do you think as they add more gens they will add the other starters as options or make it so you just choose from the latest ones i cant wait for turtwig
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if the spawn rates stay the same for my area then ill go with charmander as my town is teeming with bulbasaur and squirtle but have not seen a single charmander
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my bros and i had a heated draft haha squirtle for me we each get a diff one well be unstoppable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gonna go with squirtle only because i dont live near water and starters are rare enough as it is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wait how do you know that snivy is my
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulbasaur hes fat and small
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when i played it was always charmander but now that im older and understand the game better i dont want to have two for typesand ninetales is bae so goodbye charmander my boyfriend is a squirtle fan and i didnt want the keychains we bought of the starters to be the same so looks like im a bulba girl
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do we know if starters are tied to terrain if so ill either get the rarer for my area or the one stronger to most common local pokes so charmander or bulbasaur respectively as i live by the sea whatre your thoughts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are starters confirmed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,most of my memories of pokemon started since the anime and web browser game i think it was called pokemoncrater never grew up with original titles since nintendo as a company never grew in popularity in eastern europe when talking about anime the only episodes were shown were up until the time when mays torchic evolved to combusken and i do remember there were already generation starters in pokemoncrater picks dunno why but i always picked bulbasaur also i will be waiting for other generation pokemons in this game since i really want noctowl to accompany me on my journey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charmander
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,how about all that i can find
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you should pick the starter that has type advantage over the pokémon you can easily find around you since near you will get the same types i guess so you can steamroll the gyms with the type advantage
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what if your team colour choice is directly linked to your starter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charmander hands down
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,squirtle always gotta get that blastoise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charmander no question
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wish the starters mattered a bit more in this game but sadly due to the whole candy system they get overshadowed by stronger pokemon almost immediately
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to be honest no matter the pokémon that appear in my area and places i commute to biomes such as university golf course hospital beach wood etc ill probably go with squirtle now if i can just find lapras around the beaches of milford or west haven ct or an eevee on uni id be set haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulbasaur i had charmander and squirtle in firered but then xy came around and i chose bulbasaur i dare say i got closest to that one so bulbasaur for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charmander will be my choice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whatever i happen to catch because started pokemon dont really exist in pogo if anything itll be with meowth or rattata they are most comon where i live
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,going team red taking charmander already ordered my phone case
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure yet either charmander or bulbasaur not entirely sure how good the locationpokémon type combination is but i live near the sea and there are forrests nearby so i would assume i will be able to pick up squirtle and bulb without to much problems so probably charmander then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,water and grass are everywhere where i live i think i will have much more trouble finding a fire type i realize that that also means that ill have a lot of trouble leveling it but im in this for the collecting part of the game as much as anything else so charmander i choose you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the all important question what will you wear on your travels will you wear shorts will you wear pants will you wear nothing i choose shorts theyre comfy and easy to wear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cyndaquil
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulbasaur then bulbasaur now bulbasaur forever
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulbasaur pridddeeeeeee
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,grass master race
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bulbasaur is love bulbasaur is life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fire always fire
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this choice always has been and always will be one of the hardest to make tt
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was like that for i have done all three when playing but will be choosing charmander for sure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fear not youngling this is the perfect world the magikarp splashtime theory states there are enough bulbasaurs for everyone there are enough charmanders for all and anyone who wants squirtle shall also have a squirtle let it be known that even helix himself has decreed no one here gets stuck with a pikachu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lightbulb
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charmander charms my heart
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,go blue
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,turtle power dudes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats hot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,water bowser aint nothin to mess with
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thinking itd be too much to change the tutorial like that so id think itll always be the original starters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well the first pokemon you get is one of the to original starters via a capture tutorial id go for what is most common if you want something strong so squirtle because biomes should be fixed soon enough and blastoise will be very helpful
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,apparently yes they are part of the tutorial on catching now think pokemon yellow version when you first meet pikachu except with all starters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it isnt atm and it is very unlikely they will change that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,but the teams are red blue and yellow though i guess they could change and any of the starter trios are red blue and green
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eyy im actually in ct too around the new london area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually they do exist now in pokemon go sure they wont be much use but the choice still has to be made
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,shhhnobody tell them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice meme
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,graster race
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well cyndaquil vs totodile was a tough choice cant say the same for chickorita hahaha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,spoken like a true follower
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i love lamp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lifebulb
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope you choose your starter when you start you dont choose a team until you hit your first gym assuming it doesnt change from beta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i should hope not or else thered be no chance of getting a bulbasaur since theres no team green as mawdurnbukanier mentioned you supposedly will choose the starter at the beginning before choosing a team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,charmander char
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,really you havent dont much programming then it would be pretty easy to change the tutorial for other pokémon once theyre in the game assuming theyve designed it well a little text here and pointer references there and youre good to go marketing will probably have more work than the programmers on that one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ah okay so the ability to evolve the pokemon asap through capture far outweighs the benefit of type advantages now i say that out loud it makes more sense wouldnt want my baby bulba getting steamrollered cheers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im so hyped for this game i was on the hype train from sept until around christmas and then i got nervous about what this game would actually look like and now every question that is answered for me pushing my hype to greater heights i think i am ready to say that i will love this game and that you did it niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes they exist but they are caught in the wild not chosen at the start
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,grasster race
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i loved my chickorita
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as always im hoping for the best but expecting the worst
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not in the beta but im thinking youll want something stronger early on im all for bulbasaur so you could have him too but if you picked squirtle itll be easier for you to get blastoise a little earlier and then work up from there with a stronger pokemon even if with at a disadvantage a high cp pokemon could hold its own pretty well im guessing good luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they are also chosen from the start now via a capture tutorial
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,an optimistic pessimist like myself
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you will have to catch squirtles to evolve one to a blastoise not counting powerups might as well pick the rarer one to start with
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah so theres a lot of good options no matter what you do im personally picking bulba because hes my favorite and i have many places ill be able to get more of him i want to be able to do something with my starter not just watch him get outclassed thats my advice but theres a lot of ways to go
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in fact i plan to write down my journey with pokémon go the fictional journal will be filled with drawings and pictures of my daily adventures at his end i want to recap the day and involve the pokémon i have meet andor caught really nerdy but fun for sure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,while not as romantic as others i plan to document all the numbers i come across successfail for nice throws great throws curve balls which type of pokeball was used type of pokemon found on what terrain as per google map data etc its very sad that im excited to make a spreadsheet but i am xddd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill probably be drawing a few pictures and put them up on my deviantart account ill draw aaaall those top percentage rattata in all their uniqueness
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im part of a small youtube channel and my partner and i are planning on making at least one pokémon go video of us exploring nashville if it takes off we may make more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,currently im writing the prologue to a piece of creative nonfiction aimed to be a humorous look at the life of a trainer playing pokemon go ofc so everything i dosee will most likely end up in that if anyone would be interested in actually reading it when its fully underway then let me know o
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hadnt thought about that yet but thinking about it itd be fun to do some sort of journaldiary of the travels and events might even do a rpdocumentary spin on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i plan on making a pogo nuzlocke lets play and post it on youtube under the name of mgc maiodinsgaming channel then after that post a short story of what happened as though its a novel im working on giving what happened life example during the lets play i found a rattata all i did was throw balls in the novel i would give the rattata life say it had me chase after it or it stole something from me stuff like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not sure if im doing anythingi dont see a reason whyeveryone will be busy with their own journey im going to role play it though as if it was a real game i wish there was something i could do to record where i go simplely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im looking at downloading a screen recorder for android to help capture my travels edit is a test i just did edit httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomhecoratscreenrecorderfreeis a link to the app
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i plan on going all proffesory and documenting rare spawns in my area then finding said rare spawns basic evolutions and giving them to new players when they start out hahah
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i suppose i should say what ill be doing too i intend to do a youtube series showcasing my progress where ive been etc nothing too flashy just what ive been up to i can also post some pokemon go news as and when i hear it ill be posting to my instagram too both my youtube and instagram are dralzx for anyone interested cant wait to see everyones stories come to life
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been keeping a journal wherein i keep track of all my favorite pokemon and compare cpmovesetsheightweight of my favorite species
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im making a gopro mount for my backpacks shoulder straps will have the camera there recording gameplay all the surroundings for my youtube channel
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres an app called journey ive been using i can make simple entries that mark the day and time and i can take a picture for the entry as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im going to be doing a travel instagram for my travels ive already got it somewhat started just waiting for the game to come out if you want to check it out its pokemongoadventures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will be carrying around notebooks one to document pokémon i find one to document people i meet and one to document locations of stops and gyms i should remember i also plan on using the youtube gaming app to live stream my gym battles and eventually trades when its implemented
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,documenting my experience with logs theyll have pictures of battles captures stats and just text showing what happened that day and who i caught who i powered up etc i might make a tiny blog for it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was gonna buy some of those map books at barnes and noble and then mark spots where there are good gyms or spawning points found blastoise here etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,keeping a sort of journal of interesting encounters sounds like a fun idea actually though i doubt ill be able to journey enough to make it really worthwhile i guess i probably wont have the time to do as much exploring as i would like and im not even sure im going to run into many other trainers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i just plan to take lots of pictures i doubt i will have time or be able to put in the effort after months of playing the game to do what the rest of the people here plan to but i enjoy pictures and i will definitely be using up all the space on my phone as possible i guess i will just have my flickr autoupload the pictures and then add them to a pokemongo album
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im doing a daily vlog of my adventures in pokemon go tutorials challenges and a few ideas i dont want to talk about because i dont want to drop the ideas in case theyre unique in addition to the news content i already do im pretty much all in at this point haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was thinking about just taking notes in a journal about my progress maybe doing some screen grabsdrawings to go along with it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im currently trying to get a silph road storytelling community together to help people interact with the game basically im trying to get people to embellish their experiences with pogo into stories that other people can read and enjoy its not realistic per se and its not intended to be anything more than a supplement for other silph road activities but it has the potential to help people get and stay involved with their game and with the silph road as a whole
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will be recording and taking printsi like the idea from portugal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely gonna try and make a story out of it in blueroanokes threads
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had the same idea ill take some pictures too so i can print them and stick them in the journal alongside my notes and thoughts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i love your idea i might steal it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so like a pokemon researcher
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dude that is fantastic i am part of the romantasizing the adventure but i appreciate the effort that goes into recording the stats do you have a spreadsheet ready that you could share with all the categories one would want
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,may the karp be with you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hit me up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ps i will be using two accounts one for the nuzlocke lets play and one for my own playthrough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am calling my vids pokemon go pro
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cant wait buddy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so we have to compare our journals when we meet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,somewhere in the distance prof oak is crying tears of joy that his legacy is being kept
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,something like that a lot of people will be documenting the scenery and posting to instrgram and ill be content with my numbers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hahaha thats actually funny will you be recording with a go pro too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah just bought a chest mount for this exact purpose and now i am gonna be looking for a second mount for my other gopro for my backpack thanks to you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im actually custom making mine and walking you through how to make it yourself if youd like when im done i can probably send you one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,okay assuming we start at prestige fresh gym requiring one mon to bring to you get exp for a full clear without losing any battles mon clear first time around with clear bonus so if you clear it in about hour then you about break even with just pokestops with your jogging but if you catch pretty much any pokemon along with your jogging then you get less exp for sitting there and battling that sucker
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for a gym battles full waves for a gym battles full waves which is about per minute assuming hour to take it down while you can get per minute hitting pokestops
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,today i just took down my first level gym there are arcanines exeggutor snorlaxs vaporeon dragonit between i am using golem arcanines vaporeon exeggutor bwtween it took me around hour btw i think you should also take the time of hoarding potions into account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre not going to reach level if you dont sit at lured spots every day a friend of mine plays several hours every day since the release and spends to € per month hes at level thats less than to level edit hes actually level so million xp a bit more than
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont remember the exact amount but i did accomplish this a weekend ago and it was in the range of by after noon it was level again by the same middle aged moped rider
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,clear prestigemons defeatedprestige lostexpcumulative exp edit woo i got the table
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so if you clear it in about hour then you about break even with just pokestops with your jogging what you can grab pokestops in an hour must be a city player or a minute circle with pokestops on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pokestops are healthier but you get a medal for battles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just to bring it up here this is what i feel should be adjusted to combat gym stagnation first increase amount of exp we earn to say per pokémon defeated second decrease the hp bonus defenders receive down to bonus still a good chunk but not too much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my main exp farm is running around my citys pokestops i have too many evvverything i just wanted to know how much exp a level is worth if soloed and you always kill the leader i think i average minutes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you wanna know whats better than lures incubators hatch a day and youll have accumulated more stardust than any free player or hoarder
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats simply untrue sitting at lures is one way however there are many alternatives and variations depending upon your location physical condition and resources it really just depends on how fast you want to reach level which dictates the amount of xp you need per day you can achieve that xp many different ways
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent spent a dime and rarely if ever get a lured spot let alone i am also on the weakest team in my area and usually get on average coins per day i also walk when playing and havent spent any gas money im level currently i also officially actually started playing a week after the game came out but was a noob messing with just the pokestop and pokemon in my area for a week so id probably be right now if i started when everyone else did id probably would have chosen a different team which would probably give me an extra level just from getting coins per day well at least im the second highest level in my area the highest being the guy from the team that has the most gyms and players im literally goku fighting the frieza army lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well i can tell you im not a minute circle or a city player i was referring to ops fortunate jogging location but i also have a local park thats stops in minutes on bike though bad for egg hatching
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or just remove hp bonus as well as attack delay lets feel the endless tapping attack from ai and see who wins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you wont have too many potions for long once you start toppling level gyms i can tell you that much
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have battles and average minutes without anytime considered for potions the gyms must be very weak though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i doubt it it takes million xp to get to level and another million xp to get to level altogether it takes million xp to get to level that means in that week you wouldve had to gain million xp unlikely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agree you that silly noob thinking he can go from to in a week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,remember goku isnt smart
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and pretty much everyone plays crappy in the first week of the game its not like you just download the game and miraculously know to sit at lures for hours to hardcore xp grind
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good point
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not to mention the advice and resources that where available the first weeks of the game im so glad i stumbled upon silphroad when i did
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this has already been posted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i thought weve known for a while that they run away oo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ow that raticate runs extremely fast cool
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hitmonchan
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the leak
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is a repost btw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it was my impression or only during night we cant see cp of pokemon because both raticate and porygon founded during night have instead of cp number
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i did not see any of them running yet in the videos at least it was new for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it used to be a top percentage rattata
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive noticed that appears if you havent already caught that type of pokemon once you have it in the dex it translates
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,time for the pogo gym event error hokay everyone thanks for coming
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i wouldnt put a whole lot of resources into gengars theres nothing in the current game where you would say yep gengar time let alone against something stronger
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im down for events as long as they dont involve gym training yawn
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,step save some money especially if you live outside the us to buy a plane ticket to san francisco
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hopefully they will have nerfed bubblestrat by then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a dream nights ago that they released a mewtwo into the world and it was beyond overpowered compared to every other pokemon in the game dream foreshadowing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as someone living in a city completely dominated by mystic i hope gyms dont play a huge role
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive never enjoyed ingress anomalies so no nia has gotten better at running them but ingress anomalies seem mostly like a bunch of drunk nerds running around a city all day taking a break in the evening then drinking again all night there was so much booze around too it was my first anomaly and i all i could think was nerd bacchanal
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in any case of event ill be stocking crap load of potions most likely deleting all pokeballs and super balls to make room so i can fight all day long
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyms will likely play a major part in these events certain gyms will be worth more points than others while some could even be negative points an ingress anomaly playbox is miles across so i dont think that they need to be larger in fact that would be worse teams should tell their trainers what pokémon they need to have to attend to better coordinate gym takedowns players with max backpacks could have quite the edge on a four hour all out battle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whatever niantic does i really hope we see an official event within the next two months
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why would you put cloyster on zapdos or fight it with a vaporeon for that matter
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,events bah i dont expect any events anytime soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to defeat mew or mew dragonites to defeat moltres dragonites to defeat zapdos dragonites to defeat articuno dragonites tldr brute force dragonites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,guys the mew is only at of his health more seconds and hes down our servers are experiencing issues please come back later ay lmao loads gun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also gengar is weak to psy moves
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it will its the only teamorientated game world feature start getting good at gym battles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what do you do in anomalies that differentiates it from regular day to day gameplay
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if they plan events the same way as they did with ingress they usually announce them a few months before the date so people can book flights and make reservations if they do something that can be played locally sure they might be able to announce it and get on with it in a much shorter schedule
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,both are weak to lightning attacks but if theyre of a high enough level i should be able to kill zapdos with the high dps and with dodging cloysters frost breathblizzard attacks do awesome ice damage but if im running low on potions snorlax would probably be best
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,articuno would wreck dragonites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ghost is supposed to be a counter type to psy but the only ghost in the game has poison as an offtype great game design im only a little salty about the state of ghost types
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im plenty good i manage to hold but only because weve mapped out a territory that mystic has gotten sick of trying to take they are very much the majority
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,niantic changes the rules every series but basically you play measurements the objective is to hold certain portals at a random point in the measurement they score it and at the end of the day they declare a winner sometimes fields count too but like i said niantic changes the rules every series anomalies are known as calvinball amongst ingress players ultimately the experience is the same a full day of moving around in a city usually youll see car bicycle and foot teams theres also off site intel operators and recharge teams that help the teams on site a lot of people enjoy it personally its not for me i would only go to local ones to support the team but theres a large group of players that will travel to at least one event a series i dont know how pokémon go events would be but im going to guess theyll keep at least a few elements from ingress its teams vs teams pogo has so who knows how thatll work and the reward will be the game story changes to reflect the series outcome hanke hinted that teams will be more important in the future maybe this what he means
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry but this makes no sense you can use good groundrock pokemon for much better results against zapdos
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and yet with dodging dragonites will still win
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its like trying to use grasspoison types to counter the water type that surprise can have psychic moves god bless parasect
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it gets worse in the original games there was a glitch that made ghost not even super effective against psychic at all so yeah god bless parasect
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they are going to have to make the play areas insanely huge the number of people playing this game eclipses ingress not to mention a whole heap of lapsed players would join up for a day if there was some event happening
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the write up other than altering the game story line does the winning team that participates in the anomalies gain anything what about those on the losing team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true could do that as well im more about dps than about avoiding damage maybe its because i train gyms so much that i just want to get in and out as quickly as possible
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont really win anything except the satisfaction ingress is basically an ongoing war between two teams as there is no catching function essentially every stop is a mini gym and there are way more than in pokemon heaps of portals didnt end up as stops or gyms so the incentive to win is much higher as you can beat the enemy that you are always fighting but the story stuff is stupid no one i know follows it say that valor won an event then candela would make everyone get exp for a week or something if it was another team their leader would have done the same thing i have only been to one anomaly and it was super fun it might change if i went to them all the time but i had a great time the organisation is insane each team has apps that give them intel and people spend weeksmonths preparing and organising
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sometimes they change game mechanics to reflect the story but most suspect the game mechanic changes are predefined and they just change the story to reflect who wins the series and the game change would have been the same regardless but yeah its another gripe i have about anomalies they really dont mean anything yet require so much effort the ingress storyline is pretty shitty too lots of players dont even bother to follow it too closely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,why do they call them anomalies thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,all my pogo nemeses are on the same team i am any other notable trainers from either instinct or valor got squeezed out of gyms in my area months ago prestiging a gym draws them over like flies to honey i like to stop at below a level and watch them slog through training it up prestige at a time and then snipe the spot from them sadly they spoof so i cant see their faces must be priceless
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your nemesis seems quite fine mine is a bit more annoying my nemesis mystic usually plays with hs wife they both seem to be in their late we have been fighting since summer over some gyms in the same area he became more persistent and often came rushing on his bike to take down these gyms if i was taking them during the day he usually plays early in the morning and all day long on week ends i see all the gyms from home almost never plays after i have noticed that his wife plays with him on the week ends and in the early evening guess shes working fall once bubblestrat became known in japan at the beginning of october he started doing it every day on these gyms and i tore down these level gyms every day too and that was before the points rebalance the rebalance eventually happened and things became much easier to destroy for me he gave up on bubblestrat but made a point to raze every morning all red gyms in my usual play area which spans over some areas where he wasnt much active previously i usually play by bike but during this time my bike was vandalized with both tires punctures and both brakes cut i dont have any problems in the neighborhood and dont much people in the town so i have no clue about who could have done that i met weeks after blue players and learned that some of them were organised in a group and that i was known amongst them as the strongest red player in town i was also suspected of cheating some of them though i was a bot or a spoofer but they also knew me visually since they often saw me on my bike even though they didnt know back then who i was the idea of a pogo player vandalizing my bike had seemed ridiculous to me but at that point i wondered if a rival player could have understand who i was and did that on purpose second gym rebalance prestiging was viable again my nemesis and some of the players i met started to build every day level gyms near my home i tore that every day also i come back from work at the same station every day and fight the gym near the station on my path back home my nemesis and his wife started waiting for me every day as soon as i took the gym they would attack and let oddish inside it sometimes they would wait until i ave walked far enough if the gym wasnt blue they would let a red gym at prestige wait for me to prestige points to place my pokemon and they would then tear it down i wasnt always coming back at the same hour in these case they would actually wait or hours for me one day i came back quite late so nothing happened after i took down the gym but later around my nemesis came and destroyed the closest gym to my home probably out of frustration of having waited me for hours note that he never played that late before i sent stalker reports to niantic too no action aside from automated emails telling me to check with the police january its very clear now that now not only my nemesis but also the group he plays with have a special obsession on me if theres multiple level red gyms you can be sure theyll target the ones im in while they might let the others untouched im level highest in town my nemesis is level the others are of course i now make a point too to destroy any gyms they are in i hadnt time to repair my bike myself since november and was since then playing on my wifes bike which made me stand out even more a pink bike last week my wifes bike was also vandalized with holes in every tire both brakes cut seat screws removed i had been ok thinking it was some random act previously but now i guess its really someone who has something against me and i guess it has to be a pogo player i had reported the incident to the police the first time filled a formal complaint this time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,removing reporting spoofers is a public service im happy to carry out but i dont see them as a nemesis i recently found my one weakness in terms of gym battles an instinct team consisting of a level dad and his two young sons who team up with their beedrillpigeots etc to take down my carefully maintained valor gyms they are so freakin adorable i cant bring myself to kick them out i have to wait for someone else to do it level mystic gyms no problem level instinct gym jubilantly created by cute kids off limits
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,whenever i see him in gyms ill go out of my way to battle the gym down but only to the point where he is knocked out i also do to certain trainers and apparently ive stepped onto the toes of others on my adventures around town that some have even begun to do it to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a mystic guy thay always takes down a gym near my house bear in mind of the gyms in my town are mystic im instinct if that guy is at the bottom of any gym i take him down just for the sake of it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a spoofing nemesis too he would always spoof and bubble up the gym near my house with horseas sometimes i would take down the level gym when i had time and enough resources ive stopped attacking that gym now because theres no point in wasting my time and resources when hes just going to spoof and bubble up the gym the same day spoofing and bubble strat are the two biggest problems in the game right now he wouldnt keep leveling up the gym to if bubble didnt exist cause during the time when prestiging was nerfed he would bubble up to maybe and then quit since it took too long if bubble didnt exist then spoofers would still take down gyms but at least they wouldnt be able to bubble up to and fill it with alt accounts
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah hes finally taken to spoofing the outside of town and in a city about miles away he once had every gym downtown and built it up to a level top tier douche i wasnt as subtle as you i just called him out straight up on facebook he admitted it and said he would do it over and over again next morning when i went to collect coins i was down gyms and at i went by the gyms and he had removed everyone up to my name then booted me out left the rest of the players and the gym this went on for about three weeks it was annoying i changed my strat though and made sure i was in the top three of any gym oddly enough hes been spoofing again here recently he took down my gym that was in a graveyard closed after dark w security guards no doubt hes spoofing if it wasnt for his antics and tomfoolery i wouldnt be nearly as interested in gym battles or leveling up so he kinda screwed with the wrong player
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think i would call these my nemesis but player a is a spoofer i will throw him out of any gym i see him in sometimes ill leave the rest of the gym alone sometimes not depending on my mood player b puts three pokemon in a gym at a time idk if all three are hers or if shes adding her familyfriends dont really care if i see them in a gym i will knock them out player c brought himself to my attention last night hes a level trainer on my team he knocked down two gyms i keep both were level three since i had taken them back earlier in the day and knocked out the bottom player in two different gyms to avoid doing the training needed for the next level one of which was my dragonite and he put a pansy tauros in its place we have family members in every team getting one of them to knock his out of all four gyms was easy if i see him do it again ill get him knocked out again i dont normally bother gyms on the north side or west side but for players a and b i have made exceptions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my nemesis was an instinct spoofer that suddenly appeared in our city a few months ago i was actively kicking him out of every gym every day and reported for spoofing i have no idea if he got banned now but hes not going in gyms anymore in this city
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i have a healthy rivalry with a father daughter team and another person on instinct ive seen the one person pull up behind me and take a gym i was leveling up i always make sure to knock his gyms down if i have time the father daughter team is fun because my daughter goes to school with the girl one day we chased each other around town swapping gyms back and forth they were driving and my daughter and i were walking though so we waited them out then went and took all three gyms back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,great story and yes i have same situation u in makes game fun when you go somewhere new and see that guy oh hell no hes not gunna stay in that gym flips hat backwards and battles on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my rivals keep the game interesting and i dont think i would still be battling gyms as passionately without them i am with mystic and have rivals in valor all of whom seem to be playing legit and on similar levels to me i play mostly on breaks at work in a small town an hour from home that only has gyms and i usually turn them all blue each day we all seem to have random routines not taking gyms at the same times each day so weekday gym levels vary from and depending on who is out that day and when however each monday morning when i return every gym is at least level it appears i am the only strong enough player in mystic to take them down and if i dont then no one does as soon as i do within minutes plenty of lower level mystic players start training them up i feel that if i was to stop battling the gyms then the other mystic players might give up and that would ruin the game for everyone that motivates me to keep going and makes the challenge of having to take down level gyms on a monday more fun
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for the last months i collected my coins every hours without a problem but the gyms are special very lowturnover gyms far away from where i live some of them far away from where anyone lives the next gyms from where i live gyms between to km from home are all mystic me being valor my gyms are between and km distant i have a secondary residence elsewhere ive identified some of the local mystic players as spoofers and chose them as my personal nemesis kick them out of gyms whenever i can but since i dont need to be in any of the gyms i mentioned i never capture them i either leave them as or or something like that or completely empty gives level players of any team a chance however brief so im a nemesis to my nemesises but the great thing is they dont know their nemesis whereas i know mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the main team of three mystic players are my rivals im not sure that they consider me their rival mind you however i take down gyms they are in fairly often and its definitely not personal and they dont cheat its just that i fight by myself and can only leave one pokemon they are three and dont have to work as hard and can be very aggressive so can i its cool
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no i dont really ever pay attention to anyones username when im battling a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as a team mystic player ive had players on instinct that i used to compete with almost daily they usually would be in lvl gyms so i would surprise them sometimes by bringing the whole gym down solo one of them thanked me by saying i was somewhat keeping the game interesting for them unfortunately dealing with cold weather only a bike to work with and more instinct backup showing up daily tearing down lvl gyms solo started becoming more of a chore so i started losing interest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so the weekend after pogos release my parents and sister came to visit me i convinced them all to download and play with me we have fun when the game is working well my dads a teacher so he went back home and ya know kept having summer vacation he chose valor cuz thats what i was but turns out his town is all mystics not for long my dad is an early riser so hed get up at drive around and take all the gyms in town and then go mow the lawn hed go for pokéwalks or bike rides with my mom when she was home from work basically he was level before anyone else i knew a few weeks later he texts me a screenshot of some mystic named supersefiesdadsucks soi guess hes got a rival
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hm i dont think i have nemeses yet but i kind of think fondly of an instinct crew who come through every other weekend or so knocking down the mystic gyms by monday evening commute weve built them all up to level again so actually i have those guys to thank for making it possible for me to even get into some gyms before theyre all full again oopsinstinctwin and besthaiyang are you here on silph road you folks are awesome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i keep a list of obnoxious dbags their presence is the only thing that really motivates me to attack a gym anymore its become a small list because most of them quit playing either out of frustration of never being able to hold gyms or boredom the way my city is set up with territories and factions and group play once you get on the hitlist of a highly regarded player on an opposing team youre pretty much sol your own teammates wont back you up because odds are they are friendly with said opposing team mate and dont want to be constantly knocked out of gyms because youre in them no one really bothers with cheaters here some of the aforementioned dbags are also cheaters but thats not the point of targeting them the heavy spoofersbottersacount buyers tend to get bored pretty quickly and if theyre not also active players in the community theyll have a hard time staying in gyms even with multiple accounts because lots of mostly legit players dual account theres a sort of agreement against using dual accounts too much its considered a jerk move and is a good way to get shunned but everyone also sort of agrees to kick likely spoofers or botters out of their own respective gyms this approach only really works in an area with a closeknit active interteam playerbase with good communication we all have our own separate fb or discord groups for team coordination but we also share channels for hunting and all hunt and hang out together regardless of team affiliation im not condoning the use of dual accounts here just explaining how its use in this context prevents excessive botting and spoofing from affecting the gym meta along with territories and friendly agreements
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aww let it go hes trying to be good if he learned his lesson then thats a positive outcome i have a nemesis too but we only trade gyms back and forth and its just a game if i ever met him id be glad and id shake his hand
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a player rode a bike over my foot because he was too focused on the game i know where he frequents i frequent the same areas to knock him down broken down many lvl gyms just for him
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pretty much me and one other person are team red on my campus so all the team blue guys are our nemesis it is the same guys who always sit atop gyms we kick them out they kick us out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,finally some action but when i do it everyone calls me a stalker hypocrites
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i watched a guy from the classroom window take down my charizard guy didnt know what he had coming when i took out his vaporeon and retaliated with some training
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,see we have that where i am one guy has three accounts are quite low level so he isnt botting the problem is he takes up spots and the one is so low the the gyms are impossible to prestige after he has added he is on my team others in my family are on another team they would destroy any gym they were on because they were constantly taking all of the gyms then they were sitting at a gym when it happened he isnt botting but he is spoofing that is how he would take all of the gyms so fast and taking them at all hours of the day and night
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i too go after certain trainers around my way target them down its so fun specially when you see them there battling then i creep out like a snake in the grass and sweep it from under there noses oh its thrilling to see them as they are walking stop in their tracks and look back to see who just sniped them just that there makes my day sweet sweet victory
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,for one week on vacation i had a nemesis and it was a lot of fun it was almost like having a rival in the main series games but i dont have one anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i suspect my wife and i may have become the nemeses of a valor player within our mostly mystic area so far this winter the player has tended to take a few of the gyms that are accessible via car once a week or every two weeks etc however each time they have we would retake the gyms fairly quickly prior to our claiming time since we dont have quite enough time to defend more than gyms at once just recently though it seems as if the other player has become extra determined to topple each and every gym even if they are retaken multiple times i often worry that because my wife and i tend to use similar user names in games that we might be giving the impression of a player that is multiaccounting of course it may simply be that its motivation enough for players to want to defeat the majority team but its fun to overanalyze
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,meanwhile im wondering how on earth you can hold gyms for over a few hours im in nyc and can barely hold three for three hours
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes theres this old lady who loves taking down my gyms our battle has been going for months now at this point i just leave a pidgey or weedle with low cp its about sending a message
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,me too there is some mystic avatars names i know too well for sniping
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what do you mean prestiging draws them do spoofers have some kind of app which shows them which gyms are currently being prestiged and why would they only train it up at a time presumably if they know enough about the game to cheat theyd know how to prestige a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,please please please buy a night vision capable hidden camera and record your bike to catch this person in the act
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wow thats horrible hate to bring up this ugly topic but do they have other reasons to hate you also curious where youre playing i wouldnt mind chanseying their mystic gyms for justice
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man a great nemesis story save for the bike vandalism i would not take that lightly at all i hope you stay safe and take appropriate retaliatory measures
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,due to reddits formatting you have to type ¯ツ¯instead of ¯ツ¯ to produce a shrug this happens because is identified as an escape symbol thus removing it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i suspected this about myself but afaik its just that i use snorlaxes under to deter taking the gym down so when people on my team bump out the bottom mon and put in a rhydon i eventually get bumped
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bah sometimes its not personal i have to chime in because this kinda sounds like me i travel about hours away to work at a church on sundays and i spend about hours there through the course of the day its a gym and is regularly a level red one by the time i roll through on sunday the local kids are mostly team valor not a lot of mystic or instinct in this area so every sunday big bad corgidad comes in and knocks the gym down its not me being mean though its just hereand im here for hoursso im going to take it i never hold it long but your story made me feel a little bad maybe theres some person out there going corgidaddddd i will end youuuu
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,attack them before others have filled the tower kill the horseas and quit takes the the tower decently fast and uses no resources until the bubbler is knocked out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,took down my gym that was in a graveyard if you have a facebook chat of him admitting it you can submit that to niantic there is a special option if they admitted it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hell no hes not gunna stay in that gym exactly what i think when i see him i kinda feel sorry for the innocent players sitting underneath him in the gym but thems the breaks ¯ツ¯
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a pretty douche move to make naming your account that but i would take that as a complement that someone feels he is a worth enough opponent to call out personally
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can couch it in friendly terms but it reads like systematic bullying you and some other players have decided what the gyms should look like and you drive out anyone who isnt fitting in with that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because lots of mostly legit players dual account im right on the fence with this dilemma i used to target spoofers on opposing teams but they seem to have been much less active recently or perhaps banned altogether now the issue are the ones on my own team ive long accepted that gym shaving occurs and i know the ones in my area that do so but usually they are both active in building up gyms and will occasionally shave a couple of gyms here and there to i assume collect their full gyms the ones that are really getting to me are the ones which wait until the area is full of level towers get built a dozen or so gyms then shave the gym and put their dragonitesnorlax into the top couple of slots of each and every gym overnight im so tempted to just go ahead and create an opposing team account for the sole purpose to targeting these individuals
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,their presence is the only thing that really motivates me to attack a gym anymore yep exactly im also seeing very strong territories emerging where i am playing as well really interesting from a strategic perspective
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,may i ask in which city do you play it sounds really similar to my citys situation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i get your point however i am pretty sure that if his botted accounts didnt get banned they would still be sitting in gyms all around town how about a compromise since he cheated for months ill kick him out of gyms for months if after that time he is still legit then ill cut him a break
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at my complex theres a pool area from which i can reach a gym and spin a stop i like to sit in there with my laptop spinning and occasionally prestiging the parking area is closer to the gym but theres a hedge so i cant see it but a car will pull in in remain idoling thats my cue to fight most times ill just let them take and then instantly knock out anything they put in after a few times ill let them have it for a few minutes in case they are trying to collect but if they to train it then i cant have that its my home
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cant you just crush the lowest while prestiging against the stronger ones
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do love taking down a gym five minutes after mr multiaccount builds it up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the more traffic a gym has the less likely you will hold it in lower population towns remote areas it is a lot easier
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep correct sub this is the only sub i read on reddit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what message are you trying to send
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,do spoofers have some kind of app which shows them which gyms are currently being prestiged while i really really hope this isnt the case dont think it is tbh it would explain why i get of the spots i open up sniped in a row by invisible people i assume they tend to simply joystick around looking for gyms to put mons in so they can collect their coins while there are many lowturnoverstagnant gyms in my area there are some near hightraffic areas that flip often and never get beyond level and yeah the games been out for months in my country spoofer or not youd think peopled have found out how to prestige gyms efficiently by now but nope apparently spoofing knowledge doesnt correlate to knowledge of game mechanics
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually considering that although the guy could steal it if its not hidden well enough
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bike vandalism could be the start of a great friendship too though i mean look at misty and ash
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,having infant daughters makes me quite worried if its someone with a grudge who knows what could be next the person who did that didnt even chose bikes in a dark spot theyre just near my door and in a well lit area since i have a pokestop on my home that also increases the chance of players coming here to spin the stop and notice the bikes i use to play still hoping that its nothing more than a serial bike vandal but some pogo players doing seems very likely went to a shop in the neighborhood to get everything fixed but the shop owner didnt hear of similar things
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha ive given up on it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i definetely have a few corgidads of my own that i intend to end
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,every monday i get myself back into the gym at the church by my daughters school every sunday my rhydon comes home im okay with this i think its a fair trade to get days of coins to let someone whos bored at church take it on the day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,once a week seems mighty fine to me wouldnt fear any repercussions
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is so great im going to start thinking i will end youuuuu about all of my tiresome opponents
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hahaha i know its not personal but we all have our own little ways to optimize our fun playing the game hes just doing his thing and im just doing mine taking him out that is i bet a few guys on my neighbourhood think the same about me im one of the only instinct players around and i regularly take down the same gyms guess thats just how it is for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,he usually does it late at night and im not hardcore enough to prevent the bubbling at or even if i stop it which i have before during the day hell just redo it later
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think he cares about the level because he wants to be in the gym long term he does it for multiple gyms around the area its why i no longer touch those gyms and theyve been level for weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah theres about people that have reported him admitting it even on his team hes still spoofin like a doofus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its pretty hilarious that someone would base their identity on that xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i assume youre referring to targetting people it has nothing to do with what the gyms look like it has to with disliking a particular trainer usually because theyre really aggressive and take the fun out of the game for kids and casual players by being overtly vulgar andor physically threatening or just being really obnoxious in the local groups the types that were spraypainting their team logo on local landmarks when the game launched you know maybe its bullying to target them or maybe its just playing the game but i fail to see where its systematic either way if you are however referring to territory that kind of happened organically its actually fascinating how distinct the lines are considering they were formed entirely by chance edit mtf
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my thoughts exactly this is a multiplayer game open to everyone systematically targeting people just because you dont like them youre the douchebag
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,idunno thats kind of tricky i would think most people would find the negatives outweigh the positives when knocking down level gyms full of legit players to get rid of the guy on top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ha shave the gym i like it this is my way of informing you i may be borrowing that phrase
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think its only natural when you have an active playerbase honestly it seems like how the game was intended to function as well innerteam cooperation along with interteam aggreements and negotiations its been a highly social game in my area which has been at times really good and at other times a little bumpy but its gotten a lot of otherwise lonely people outside socializing and making friends some with a rough transition and has formed a pretty tight community that was an amazing phenomenon to watch happen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,eugenespringfield in oregon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes but when it is a level it will take me times through with my level prestiging is already difficult to begin with
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you take down my gym ill take down yours even though i dont even need it well that would be my message but id put a lickitung in there instead of a pidgey or weedle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they never suspect the second camera
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good get him on property theft as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha good point there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,first talk with the police dont file a report just immidiately but ask for any weird similar reports tell them of pokemongo too and even leave a phone number or email in case they want to investigate further or in case they learn of something similar secondly put a camera if not for try is there any way to get it out of sight
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i see subarudad sometimes no corgidad though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your rhydon gets to rest on the day just as god intended
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,damn its a shame niantic takes so long to do anything especially in such clear cases
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is there a smileybot too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a competitive game with no built in motivation to compete but youre welcome to your opinion
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah thats definitely a fair point though i will say there was one instance not too long ago when someone decided they had seen enough of the level towers and took down all the them during a night time raid the legit regulars rebuilt the towers over a period of a few days unfortunately once stable again reattracted the aforementioned shavers basically the gym meta is broken using cp to determine which slot you are in the gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,haha of course as im certainly not the first to use that term here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this seems like more of a shelbyville post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks ok i understand the message better now but still no one owns gyms do they or maybe the other person feels that youre taking down their gym also if i didnt actually need the gym and wasnt going to get coins id probably leave it alone unless i was sure that the other person also didnt need it im probably the old lady nemesis of a player in a nearby village we only have one gym in our village usually mystic sometimes valor occasionally instinct with several local players the other village has two gyms and only one valor player along with a park area with lots of different pokemon so when i go there i take down his gyms and claim the coins recently without having met we seem to have come to an understanding i dont take both gyms every time especially if another valor player has come along and put a mon in because valor rarely have gyms elsewhere and they need coins too in return the other village player has started leaving me the gyms for over hours sometimes longer so i think well have to agree to disagree but just taking back your gym for the sake of it seems unnecessarily mean to me unless as i said the other person is doing exactly the same thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heshe is welcome to their opinion but in this case their opinion is correct targeting a specific player is pretty clearly a trainer guidelines violation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree so much would be solved if they just used a different ranking system first come first serve has a fatal flaw of no one wanting to put in the work to level a gym up to just to get the bottom slot but if they just acknowledged pokemon levels and prioritized gym spots by level rather than cp maybe with a suborder of cp for pokemon of the same level or a suborder of fcfs the gym meta would not only be less rife with abuse but would become more diverse
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats very kind of you and i apreciate that kind of play style there are some players in my city that get easily offended if someone takes down their high level gyms and if they get kicked out of one single gym they drive madly around town and kick the other person out of every gym they can find them most of the time that means that uninvolved low level players get kicked out too i don´t get that greedy need for vendetta
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,during the past week ive carved out two gyms for my side valor while leaving a number of their mystic gyms alone that i would usually take down on a daily basis so far no attacks so well see if we can come to some sort of understanding definitely would be nice if there was a way of communicating in game but im more than willing to let them have some stagnant level gyms if i can have a couple now if they do attack i dont care about being mean they will be attacked in return period im not a total meanie though i leave instinct alone because theyre basically zero threat in my area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dang really i guess i have to tell my neighbor were not allowed to fight over the gym between our houses anymore against the tos bummer
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,suborder of cp for pokemon of the same level or a suborder of fcfs the gym meta would not only be less rife with its also been suggested to oder pokemon by the amount of prestige added by the trainer so shavers would always be on the bottom interestingly that bubblestatt horsea would always be on top
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed a filo approach has some serious flaws which could cause a level tower having the gym leader being a cp pidgey though i think filo could potentially work in conjunction with the existing cp approach whereby when you entered the gym gave your a bonus cp either as a percentage or flat amount based on the order you got into the gym meaning the earlier you got into the gym the greater bonus and increase the likelihood you would sit at or near the top and that the later ones eg the shaver would have to overcome a significant deficit in order to climb up the gym rank
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks good to see other people with the same point of view im sure there are many of us here
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats different then sounds good to me sorry i misjudged you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are you targeting a specific player by fighting over a gym of course not but it should be noted that being overly protective of a particular gym is also a trainer guidelines violation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah amount of prestige added would seem to be one of the better approaches to deter shavers the potential drawback would be the bubble strat and the proliferation it would cause of that particular method if gym rank was based on amount of prestige though i think it would be easy enough to nerf bubble strat by simply making the max prestige you can get in any fight be based on the existing formula or the cp of the mon you were fighting whichever is less ie the only time you could prestige per fight is when the opposing mon has a minimum cp of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,or for the gym to fall points for the lvl to shaver making them have to prestige all the way back up points instead of just a few to get their mon in there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats not a bad idea either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really like the suggested effort value ranking for lack of a less confusing term considering evs are a thing in this universe that was suggested where the person who puts in the most prestige gets top spot obviously any system has to have secondary and tertiary sorting for tie breakers im also fond of pokemon levels prioritizing over cp so that we can have things like hypnos and venemoths and starmies at the top but honestly i wouldnt mind the negative you mentioned where there could be a pidgey at the top in fact i would relish in it my dream since the beta has been to put my ratatta at the top of a gym at a local restaurant names joeys it was a gym during the beta but was removed at launch ive even been saving my one name change for the opportunity to add youngster to my name edit mtf
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a direct correlation between pogo egg distance and the main game egg cycles thats what we used at gamepress to predict gen ii egg distances
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,known glitch pokemon are switching spots when powering up youre seeing two different magikarps in that video whats happening pokemon selection is based on pokemon spot on the list the player is viewing spot out of pokemon spots in other words the player is not viewing magikarp he is viewing spot which contains a magikarp example spot not powered up spot after powering up spot spot not powered up the gets bumped down the list from to and the player is stuck viewing spot hope thats clear if not feel free to search reddit
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,real question is if why would niantic post it if its a bug human error
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im convinced too that height and weight matter the appraisal doesnt need to mention it again if theres already labels for it its like niantic is surprised we havent figured it out yet height weight xs xl what could it all mean
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dont forget there is now another glitch when a pokémon is powering up he dont get the right cp bonus visual bug it could be the same by this way
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and a pokemon xs weight and xl height is appraised like hes a normal one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they also attack more which is pretty annoying
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got on reddit to see if anyone else was experiencing this ive noticed this and the increased attack rates too frustrating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,onyxia also deep breaths more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive been looking for a thread like this it seems like higher level pokemon are harder to catch i just wasted regular balls and great balls on a sanshrew then regular on a ekans n a pidgey over on a mankey thats over balls on pokemon wasted ultra balls on a squirrel that ran i am also using berries but its getting frustrating
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im going to throw my anecdotal evidence in the agree category for this thread as a higherlevel player it seemed i couldnt catch much of the standard spawns last night with a pokeball that didnt land as great or better or at least a great ball to get a yellow targetting ring having said that i can kind of see a reason for this noting my prepatch behaviors i more or less ignored the balltoss game on most catches on more common guys i wouldnt even look at the phone after the first throw relying on audio cues to know that the mon broke out and i needed to throw another and memory to know about how to throw the ball from the perspective of players are ignoring the mechanics such a move makes sense counter points first the game is very heavily about collection were looking at catching guys for one power up on one mon right now im pretty sure almost no one wants to have to seriously focus for the hundreds of catches needed to make any resemblence of progress in this game second attention span one of the best aspects of this game imo has been the get out and go aspect for getting exercise im sure weve all seen and been that guy that stops in the middle of the walk way because were trying to do something on our phones requiring our full attention span to try and land proper throws for standard mons makes this worse and greatly reduces our ability to move around third throwing accuracy i cant speak for everyone but for me personally my specific accuracy for hitting target areas isnt that great due to a number of factors including variable fingerscreen friction and occasional stutters as my phone tries to render the game as the known issues ill often have consecutive throws that feel significantly different not have any noticeable effect when trying to actually land the circles combined with the fact that a number of mon stand at different distances now some have always been hard to eyeball how far they are and certain ones just seem to have weird hitboxes now goldeen was not a happy trainer last night
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my great balls seem to be flying straight through the pocket monsters when i eventually did hit the thing it broke out twice a cp pidgey breaking out of great balls edit minor text fixes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah they attack more escape balls more and flee more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they fixed the random curveballs so it cancels out the loss of extra balls a little besides if they did it to increase sales for pokeballs theyd have added great and ultraballs to the shop instead since this forces people to use those more then just spending more on standard balls i imagine that theyre trying to stop the binge leveling a bit because of how easy it was to catch a gazillion pidgeys with pokeballs like in the original games you should be using great and ultraballs for higher level pokémon so the increase of ultraball catch rate versus the lowered catchrate of standard balls make sense i think the game wasnt in a state to deal with the amount of high level players yet and it shouldnt be because at the previous rate everyone would be maxed out before niantic could even think of adding more content and they implemented the huge exp gaps for lvl for that reason but we basically amass exploited the evolution mechanic on easy to catch low level pokémon like pidgeys the only thing i think should happen i can imagine this might already be the case is a higher droprate for great and ultraballs at pokestops for higher level players
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems like ive had an unusually high number of green ring pidgeys breaking ballsfleeing and things are definitely dancing and fighting more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess they were unhappy with pokeball sales this is pure speculation but they also would have made way less money if they had dealt with spoofers by now i know a lot of people that want to level to catch up buying stuff from the shop
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,also it feels like theyve altered the throwing physics a little bit as my usual throwing technique seems to miss a lot more now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,level here i catch about in of the pidgeyweedle class postupdate they also made the quick toss impossible now as the pokemon zooms out fully before you can throw
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its really very difficult i am running out of options to stay in this game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,naw everything is running now lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a caterpie that was nonstop attacking but otherwise my breakfree flees seem to be normal with about pokemon caught since the update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have the same experience many time today berry catch miss repeatidly on cp rattata and then they ran away although i find it fun that they are more agressive i really dont understand the point of lowering the catch rate it just make the game more frustrating as if catching pidgey and rattata all day was not already on the hedge between fun and unfun i really dont get the point i can only see selling more pokeballs but given the money the game generates already it seems to be a very marginal gain for a lot of frustration amongst players given the game has already so many issues driving players frustrated i cant believe it would be a smart move and thus the choice niantic made it makes me really confused
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,though i live in a city my neighborhood is sort of a dead spot with only very occasional spawn points nearby which typically only spawned the usual common suspects so far this morning ive seen much more diversity on my radar meowth ryhorn ekans eevey and not a single pidgey weedle or caterpi yet this morning havent tried tracking them down but perhaps the spawn rates have changed since i do most my hunting via bicycle this new update could be a huge boost if the uncommons spawn more frequently with a larger detetion radius
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lowering the catch rate pisses me off but i could deal with it if they didnt run away so damn often had a bunch run away after one toss as if i were soft bannedbut i caught a few things in between
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no im sure they made it much harder to catch pokemon with the update they both jump and attack more and break out more it also seems that the curve ball is slightly different now im super annoyed by this more than anything else they are basically making it impossible to be a free to play player
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here already missed a cp squirtle a few cp rattatas and spearows even if i threw berries and great balls however when i threw berries and ultra balls the capture rate seemed to be higher than before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it definitely feels like razzberries have a greater effect now but the hit box on the pokemon are smaller and they definitely do seem to fight and break out more it also feels like the ball curves more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they seem much more agressive and slightly harder to catch can datamining reveal something new
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so many pokeballs for one pidgey i think it makes sense that they would alter catch rates if its harder to catch a pokemon without throwing a nice great or excellent it would force trainers to focus more on the catch maybe the extra focus would discourage playing the game while driving also more resilient pokemon are at least for me forcing me to use berries i would have like berries and would just dump them to make room in my inventory now im using them more consistently post patch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had an extremely hard time catching mid level starters over balls for a charmander and same for a pikachu this is for both me and my girlfriend catch rates are definitely down for redorange ring mons
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,findings share went out for a lunchtime walk today at level my encounters were usually lowmid hundreds a single cp tauros appeared all my throws are orange pokemon definitely attack a lot more it seems important to wait and time the throw now this on its own i feel is a fair difficulty increase since you can time your throw for the mobs cooldown encountered pokemon and were captured on the first accurate ball one shellder escaped immediately after breaking out of the first ball so based on a very small sample decreased capture rate hasnt been borne outyet curve balls are much more difficult now they tend to bounce in front or behind the pokemon due to extreme arc and the difficulty is increased further because you also have to time it due to attacks it used to be i would just curve every throw out of habit as it is ill leave it to someone else with more resources to test out if its possible the skill floor for catching pokemon has definitely increased
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to put a positiveerspin on this i found catching pokemon with curveballs increases the catch rate a lot more than it did if you manage to hit a nice or excellent curveball then its almost a guaranteed catch almost anecdotal evidence of course after i had a good days catching today maybe someone can conduct better science
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i already always have a low amount of balls this is really gunna suck my area doesnt have very many pokestops near me either rip
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i noticed too especially pidgeys razzberry masterball nice curve throw fleeing pidgey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they attack more often less predictably and break out more consistently today than any other day all in all a disappointment of an update if i didnt work on top of a pokestop id probably have burnt out trying to keep a supply of pokeballs by now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i used or so great balls and two pikaballs on an eevee almost all of them hit the bastard but he kept escaping he wasnt super high leveled and his ring was only yellow besides that i have been noticing pokemon are attacking and escaping more
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive experienced the same thing and since i cant often get to pokestops i doubt ill be able to keep playing because i cant afford to just keep buying highly ineffective balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,been the same for me i think it was done to account for them making the curve ball thing go away same amount of wasted balls but at least you throw straight like you intend to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i havent noticed a change in breakout rates since the update but i had pokemon flee today out of the i caught when before id have been unlucky if i had out of flee
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just a tip for those who dont know if you go to catch a pokemon and miss you can quickly tap the pokeball while its rolling on the ground to gain that pokeball back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel like niantic was trying to make the catching process more difficult and just went absolutely overboard no i swat your measly balls away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at an impressively high rate my record was balls in a row avoided by a growlithe
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,makes you wonder with all the problems with the game currently they turn their efforts to making the game play less enjoyable its like they want to get rid of players although im sure its just a way to try and get more poke ball purchases
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,more dots
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dkp minus
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,those were the days
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is getting ridiculous i can only imagine that niantic did this to increase pokeball sales
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel your pain i just took a trip to a pokestop heavy part of town specifically to fill up on balls yesterday and now it just feels like theyre wasting away far too quickly edit i feel even worse for rural players now their already limited resources are just going to be more challenged
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wasted ultra balls on a squirrel that ran ha i only wasted ultra balls on a squirrel that ran if by squirrel youre referring to clefairy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dat edit totally stealing this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope random curve balls for me and two other friends still happening
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive noticed the same for the berry ultra ball combo before it seemed mediocre at best but now very solid which i feel it should be however tossing great balls at a rattata im just going to use for candy anyways seems a bit frustrating to me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my starters have always been a flee rate for me maybe i am just unlucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still throw only curveballs they definitely arc more so i need to retrain my handeye coordination i have also observed more dodging and attacking which is annoying since they can attackdodge between the time the ball leaves my hand and the time the ball hits i cant speak to the base capture rate however i get streaks of easy catches and then guy pops up that eats through balls before fleeing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so ball doesnt curve no more but harder to catch
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that claim is debunked long time ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,revenuedriver run out of balls quicker and end up buying them i think they should be careful if this is even remotely what they are thinking as it will drive so many paid players out of the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i leveled up to last night i had many pokemon with cps under attack more than pokemon with and cp my friend was playing with me and he mentioned it as well
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i caught a cp pinsir last night that fought me tooth and nail took me over pokeballs i found a pinsir later and that one faught the same but i gave up haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it actually comes from the recent spinoff hearthstone the mmo warcraft of worlds
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not going to spend more money on a game that is only frustrating ive spent i wish i would have known about the companys reputation before i purchased
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is no evidence of this whatsoever especially niantics motives this is all anecdotal i have found pokemon were easier to catch with pokeballs but tauntedjumped more who is right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i went home early i ran out of regular great and ultra balls i was at an urban lake that has over poke stops but its not that easy replacing great and ultra balls i felt defeated especially since i had a lot of pokemon that ran away
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i expect they meant squirtle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually ive had a theory since well before the patch that some pokemon species and cp being equal spawn just to eat balls that is youll be better off if for any given pokemon you just give up on it after it throws off balls or so i just dont have the time or scripting or mathematical knowledge to make something to prove that it isnt just random chance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can still make it curve but it doesnt seem to do it on its own anymore but yeah
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,which is funny because i refuse to spend actual money on things like pokeballs since i can just hit the pokestop loop by my house whenever i get low i dont mind spending my money well google opinion rewards wallet money on other stuff in the shop like bag upgrades lucky eggs incubators etc hell id spend money on cosmetic items before i spent it on pokeballs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am trying to remain hopeful that nintendo has some significant pull regarding things like how to generate revenue niantic has seemed to be fair with ingress and nintendo has usually about being generally accessible i would like to believe that neither of these companies have looked at the profits over the quality of the product
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems like theres a pretty strong consensus that this is true based on anecdotal evidence but we need hard data or to actually look at changes in the code before we start blaming niantic for insidious intentions like trying to price gouge people
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,being in a rural area ive added the money up i spent and i have bucks in this game niantic wont get another dime since the update i asked for a refund for my purchases its just not worth it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,either spend money or save your balls for pokemon you havent caught yet ive always thought it was bad design that the game made people catch and evolve pidgey en masse or sit around at stops with lure modules at least there will be a little less of that now
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,fthat i just run away with the sunk costs of balls if its a pidgey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had a low cp pikachu break free and flee from ultra balls after using a berry i didnt think that was likely
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,less players less odds of people spending money people are less inclined to spend money if many of their friends quit i get what you are saying but people will only buy so many poke balls before they realize its not worth it i can see incense lures and lucky eggs but with how many balls it takes to catch stuff people will simply stop wasting their money since their getting so little back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tbh i already spent a bunch of money on the game but i wont be spending anymore im close to uninstalling after this update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,wrong video mr bot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can request a refund
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sorry for the late response but itunes is currently refunding people who are upset about the changes to the game there was a thread about it recently but you should be able to get all of that back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the company has a great reputation this subreddit is toxic edit holy shit i thought i was in rpokemongo consider this blunder akin to transferring your prized dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,agreed my catch rate has actually gone up since the update they definitely defend more though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i guess youre right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,jynxs were definitely in the game to eat balls and thats it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,and the curve is much more severe than before very pronounced
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not to mention pokeballs will not help you catch the big things you want very much either
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nintendo only owns of the pokemon company which is only a partner with niantec over this game nintendo likely wont have much say at all really but the pokemon company certainly does
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im at around the same amount although most of mine was spent on backpack storage im lucky to live in a medium sized city and drive all day for work so im swimming in a mountain of balls i wont as for a refund but i also wont spend anymore money until the game is at a quality i expect and has some features finished along with some communication at a basic level from niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nah the ones leaving are the ones who didnt buy anything the ones sticking around either feel obligated cause they invested monetarily into the game or shrug off the bugs and spend hundreds of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive spent probably about after playing this patch for an hour i uninstalled they managed to somehow sap what remaining fun i found in the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,heck if you think its a waste of money you should request a refund vote with your dollar
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,found the niantic employee
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they dont have a good reputation when it comes to communication as for this subreddit i actually think its pretty fair rpokemongo on the other hand is a toxic wasteland of complaints and overreaction
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,camera angle changed to a flatter angle meaning that curves are more sensitive its like nobody in niantics testing team does curve balls lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no they get most of their sales from social drinkers and bars an alcoholic is one person someone throws a party they will go through more alcohol in a night than the alcoholic will in a month
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nah alcoholics can barely hold a job down casual wins in the long run
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive spent on the game and now that tracking sites are gone i have almost no interest in the game anymore and the decreased catch rate and how often pokemon now run is niantic trying to milk this game for every thing its worth before it finally dies which it seemingly will do very soon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol i think you might be right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,see i can get on board with some civil discourse i do agree i think theyre handling the roll out very well considering the huge response the communication will come in time and theyve already demonstrated with the latest update that theyre listening to the community this isnt just niantics reputation on the line but that of nintendo the pokemon company and gamefreak its only been weeks some people need to take a step back and really evaluate whats going on this game is gonna be killer soon enough and yes this subreddit is incredibly toxic im all for criticizing niantic and i admit i get defensive when i see such toxic entitled whiney bullshit all over this subreddit theyre obviously doing what they believe are the right choices at this moment in time we definitely dont see the whole picture the way they can geez this game is obviously turning into something amazing give it time edit holy shit i thought i was in rpokemongo im going to go ahead and leave that response when rpokemongo was mentioned it didnt register until after i finished consider this blunder akin to transferring your prized dragonite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this guy gets it pokeballs were already a really bad sale yes even for rural players but with a worse catchrate nobody should ever buy those fodder balls its just a waste of money
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have never met an alcoholic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same there is a gym in my area that does exactly the same whenever i try to train it it kicks me with an error message after the go words before battle then pokestops turn white when i click on them image doesnt load and cant spin them i am forced to re log tried another gym it worked went back to this one still buggy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same here at only this one gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,try turning on then off airplane mode worked for me once then the other timeconsuming steps afterwards i guess restart phone clear cache reinstall game etc etc but yeah this glitch sucks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah im on week three with the same level gym bugged try to battle it and the game breaks today it only broke the game for minutes rather than so progress ive reported the issue in detail to niantic with a screenshot and steps to replicate the issue havent heard from them and its been days so today i tweeted at them because thats been such a successful way of communicating with them for so many people have you reported it to niantic
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,got a local level instinct gym that hasnt changed in at least weeks same thing happens when i go after it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when the error is kicking me out of a gym i turn off wait some seconds and then turn on the location service ios it almost aways work for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,had the same problem with the same team a few weeks ago i reported it every day with the same screenshot until niantic did something about it and it finally got fixed
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no need to really hassle for it besides the accomplishment of having another one of thos iv starters i have my blasty with water gun and ice beam good against drogons which can be essentially replaced with a good iv slowbro with the same moveset and yeah vaporeon can replace the other half
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not worth waiting for just evolve the one you have and get the pokedex entry and move on by the time you hatch a high iv squirtle youll probably have saved up another candies i waited for a high iv one and my blastoise ended up with bite and flash cannon and yeah vaporeon is the way to go for water pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well the way i see it you might as well just evolve it for the dex if you get a better squirtle you will eventually have enough candy for another blastoise if you keep playing if you dont keep playing you wont care anyways p
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just save candies before doing anything if you dont find a better squirtle by then it wont make much difference moveset iv by a long shot if you like having the best and will be uncomfortable always know its a blastoise like i would then wait
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my only perfect pokemon so far was a squirtle and its blastoise version has flash cannon as its charge move so yeah dont sweat it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would wait until you want to fill the spot in the pokedex at that point you can confidently evolve your squirtle knowing that you arent likely losing out on future fighting power vapes got you covered but there is no rush to evolve him right now because youre not losing out on fighting power not having a blastoise
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have enough candies to evolve a second blastoise now and im in a somewhat related pickle my first blastoise was he ended up having ice beam which isnt the worst thing in the world but id rather have flash cannon hes also only level or less iirc around im now level so now i have just enough candies to evolve another theyre hard to come by here not as rare as charmander but pretty rare problem is ive got a whos level and a whos level obviously the level would be considerably stronger right now without powering up and with blastoise not being that great anyways do i really want to waste stardust and wait forever for candy to power him up but what if he gets bite at least if i did the and he got bite hed still be high iv then again why dont i just power up the one i drive myself crazy with this crap and usually just end up evolving the highest level mon i have and keeping the high iv one on the back burner
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man ive caught enough squirtles to get candies from them and not one that i caught was above iv either they are really rare or i just suck at luck im starting to give up on finding the best squirtle around for evolving
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are you going for your best iv or your best cp squirtle because now theyre saying ivs have very little impact in battles and maybe cp is the way to go i have a cp squirtle that is not likely to make it in battle with stats only trending in the positive i was gonna wait for a higher iv one but now i may just evolve this one
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lots of missing information whats your trainer level cp of the squirtles though trainer level would indicate your max cp at your level anyway lol and whats your stardust and of course whats your end game edit and your squirtle candies too if its to fill the dex evolve away if its to level wait until you have more evolves if its to gym it depends whether or not youre trainer level if its to find stronger pokemon for squirtle in particular id save the candies and evolve after ive caught a squirtle when youre trainer level since youll be catching naturally higher cp squirtles why do i make a point about level if youre anything under using stardust and candies to get to x level thats under is a bit of a waste other threads here speak about the usefulness of ivs in the long term if you truly care about dmg ive thrown away a lot of level squirtles at ivs now that i know dmg and def are practically negligible due to how niantic calcs stuff tiny bit sad ive been holding out for a higher iv level squirtle
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,was originally thinking ivi decided to evolve it though i dont come across too many squirtles where im at so trying to think about how long it would be until i saw candies would just be too much iah ill power up blastoise in the end if i really want to but all the talk about him being a poor mans vaporeon really has me not caring too much about its overall ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if youre going to be inputting it somewhere with your phone might as well submit it to the official silphroad pokedex
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,maybe whip up a quick google form that way itll log directly into a spreadsheet and you can enter stuff like pokemon name and time via drop down instead of typing them out all the time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this makes sense to me theyre slowly introducing a new feature into the beta with each region ensuring that each feature works and is fully functional before they introduce something else can you imagine how much of an issue it would be if team battling was included when there was still bugs in the single battles
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,makes sense not to mention the fact that if these features have to be done inperson or at least within a certain range the beta testing will have to be opened up to a much larger group or at least to more people in select areas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think straight on pvp will be an option i hope to be corrected
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i would love team battles imagine being able to work with your friends against other players and their teams
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,us trading europe pvp
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,movesets are always random even if the pokémon came from the same spawn i guess you two just had very similar luck and as long as the unevolved pokémon has moves that the evolution can have theres always a chance the moveset wont change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah movesets are always random on evolution if you play together and evolve the same mon not sure how you havent come across this before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its not only possible its how the game is designed to work its all random on evolution also if you both spin the same stop you can get different eggs vs and even if they are the same you can hatch different pokemon also for evees even if you both catch he same one and evolve at the same time they are both random can be the same but might not
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i evolve and staryu to starmie did not change moveset at all from tackle power gem tacklepower gem is a possible moveset on starmie just bad luck i guess what has me curious though is even evolutions get the same moves are you saying that when you and your relatives catch the same pokemon and evolve them you get the same moves are you all on the same team what about your account types are they all ptc or all google what about your usernames do they all have the same three starting letters
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,moveset probability is evenly distributed between fast attack and charged attack since theres two fast attacks and three charged attacks starmie can choose between from your specific moveset would occur the time so its not unusual
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they are on android i am on iphone all trainer accounts for the majority of the time we play and i mean for almost all the time we play its the same pokémon no matter the tier same move sets and same cp every now and then the cp will be different but the appraisal and moves will be the same i would chalk it up to rng and amazing luck but its all three of us are almost of the time everything is the same yes we are all mystic as well i would be willing to do more testing if needed i know most everything is random but its almost all the time we get the same mon pops with same cp and move sets
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is true however about of the time we play every mon we catch is all the same cp moveset and appraisal trust me im all for rng and all but this is been the way its been for us since as long as i can remember
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they are on android i am on iphone all trainer accounts for the majority of the time we play and i mean for almost all the time we play its the same pokémon no matter the tier same move sets and same cp every now and then the cp will be different but the appraisal and moves will be the same i would chalk it up to rng and amazing luck but its all three of us are almost of the time everything is the same yes we are all mystic as well i would be willing to do more testing if needed i know most everything is random but its almost all the time we get the same mon pops with same cp and move sets
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it really is just rng iv are always the same so if you are the same level cp will be the same too movesets are the same too movesets after evolving on the other hand are completely random you have a one in six chance of getting the same moveset as someone else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,iv and moves of caught pokémon are always the same for everyone cp too if you have the same trainer level moves of evolved pokémon are always random
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,move set and ivs appraisal are the same its the same pokemon with cp scaled to level based off your trainers level so if you are all playing together and same level most likely the pokemon you catch will all be the same but it dosnt affect any of the other things i listed it seems up until now you were or luck or unlucky with movesets edit for clarity when you see a wild pokemon on the map its ivs apprasial and move set will be the same for all players that catch it only difference will be the level of the pokemon scaled to trainer level which will impact the cp if you all play together most of the time its likely you are all the same level so you will see very similar to identical pokemon on wild catches as most values dont change upon evolution you will have similar final pokemon movesets which are rolled every time will vary if they have been the same up until now its just luck bad or good hard to say this is how some of the old trackers were able to not only give location but ivs and movesets
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that makes more sense now wife just leveled up to and thats when we started seeing different cp pokémon for her damn must have just had some bad rng for this staryu thanks for the clarification though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea that sounds about right i think once you get over then you all see te same although all the people i played with already gave up so cant be sure on that but its what other said bad luck on the starmie though gunhydro ones are great for training
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes because you have more experience playing the game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,at level one you didnt see any level pokes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no trainer level has zero direct effect on catch rate httppokemongogamepressggcatchmechanics what changes as you level are three things the range of possible wild pokemon levels this actually makes things harder because you encounter higher level pokemon access to resources greatultra balls razzberries your skill at throwing nicegreatexcellent and curveball throws these bonuses add both xp and a positive modifier to your catch chance
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,slightly connectedi found that after reaching level i started getting more ultra balls from pokestops having nicer balls has made a difference to me anyone else notice the change in balls
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i feel at lower levels it was easier to catch pokemon at level i feel like i dont get enough pokeballs to combat the amount low level stuff breaks out
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,irl experience the hidden stat
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no doubt i almost never use ultra balls rarely needed as a result i have over great and ultras but about regulars i hit pokestops hoping for more regulars but seems to get as many great or ultra combined as regulars may be imagination but i seem to get plenty maybe i should use them more but i really dont need to sort of like the max potions i have saved up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gamepress disproved that actually getting it in the colored ring does matter see the link in my earlier post
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for posting about it again i totally missed this before
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,prints out one of the cards with my phone number on it and hands them out to the ladies in the clubs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pssh who am i kidding i dont go to clubs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolve first if you get a good moveset great if not you still have the novelty of a shiny gyarados without having dumped another stardust and candies into it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mine only has iv shes maxed out to im having fun with it even though its like lower than my ones
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,evolve first then if its got a bad moveset you wont have wasted all that stardust
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i didnt find a shiny karp during the event so i rage evolved my cp lowish iv karp i got in a different country during the event now its a cp gyarados with location branding tldr do it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,rpokemongoivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,power regardless of the moveset i was lucky enough to get a shiny but ended up with dragon tail crunch still maxed it despite the bad moveset
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats stardust
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea thats the only problem maxed its gonna be like less than my garys but its red lol what moveset did you get my last were hp so i hope i keep the same luck
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am having a hard time believing that you found a single karp and it was a shiny and you are level too you either used scanners or sniped a ton of karps until you get a shiny one can anyone please tell me what are the odds of this actually happening thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,that a nice gyarados great moveset hope i get the same luck as you
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually i have gyarados from another country from a trip i made i hatched alot of eggs because i was always at incubators hope you get your shiny soon you eventually will dont lose faith
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,best defensive moveset sure a bit disappointing that you cant use him much for attacking but thats the best trophy in the game for sitting on gyms looking cool af and keeping other people staring at it for as long as possible so dont feel too bad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,glanced too quick lol thanks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dto i evolved first only powered it up a little then after it got kicked out of its first gym i was like f it and poured on the dust lol no regerts eta actually now that i looked it was a decent level when i caught it httpimgurcomnyuhvfa
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what the hell are you talking about i dont have a karp much less a one above
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no one knows the exact odds but given that shininess is per trainer and the increased number of karp spawns necessarily must have increased the number of perfect karps this kind of thing is bound to happen to one or more people on this sub lets say everyone on this sub caught karp over the course of the event so x on this sub is million karp catches odds of in so the expected number of perfect karp would be close to even at shiny per karp wed then expect perfect shinies out of the population of this sub
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i think the release dates in these countries are not determined by ninatic but the government
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no the game actually ran smoothly for first two weeks now geoban is in place so we cannot play the fact that amazes me the most is geoban is still in effect in nepal but has been lifted in major cities of india or even some places of china
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it has been confirmed they have continued spawning after the event youre all good
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i had to catch around pokemons before i got my first ditto patience
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,as others have said keep trying i managed to level from to using eggs off of just pidgeys and rats from this event and got my first ditto this morning
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,like all things in life remember you are never alone level from hong kong here and i work in the cbd where rare mons spawn but still havent been able to get onei get sorta envious when someone puts a ditto in the gym beside my office but then again im just enjoying the hunt i guess it will be more rewarding to catch that first one compared to someone who got it within the first hour
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,found one tonight at the same spot that i found one nights ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,keep trying good luck theyve popped up randomly for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,during the event i caught almost pokemon and got dittos pretty good average of one every
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,we dont really know much about biomes so the claim that it isnt big enough to be a biome is unfounded
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dragonites spawn in the same biome as clefairy so consider yourself lucky
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,hint its not a nest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,something very similar to my by a large retail area i think its just a biome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres one in my city too on the nest atlas there are many markers for this area and most of them have clefairy reports since the beginning of the atlas
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my neighborhood has always had clefairy spawns with the nidoran and zubat being more common than pidgey and rattata i think it could be considered part of a mountain biome theyre not ridiculously overpopulated but its not out of the norm to boot up the app and immediately have one or two spawn in range of my house i recently had someone refute my nest claim on the atlas which in turn was also refuted by someone else who had driven through and found clefairy not that im complaining i love the buggers i have asked myself your question many times though odd species to never change
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,does being in a biome rather than a nest increase the chance of other rare spawns similar to that biome pokemon someone in another thread posted about the frequency of seeing dragonite near clefairy spawns i think ive found a biome becau despite these nest migrations the clefairy still appear consistently in those locations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its more of a nest then a biome the area covered is the size of a nest and follows the shape of the roads etc as for dragonite i have been to clefairy whatever it is and only seen dragonite twixe and missed themboth however one was at another frequent dragonite marker a ruined abbey so i cant say whether it is because of clefairy or just luck it is also within a biome itself trying to work out exactly what this is because as i said it is just clefairy it acts like a nest but isnt etc it is basically some oddball
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i found both dragonite and snorlax within my neighborhood biome aerodactyl is a possible spawn as well if we can make the assumption that clefairy holds a hint for the biome type downtown has the same biome it would seem but they have a dragonite or aerodactyl spawn at least once a week from what my local fb group sightings claim
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nests are as big as the park or golf course that they are in the only thing that characterizes a nest is rotation and as you say this doesnt the only thing that characterizes a biome is a specific set of spawns that never rotates and as you say that is what this is
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive seen an aerodactyl spawn around the same area that has the clefairys spawn
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes but a biome also spawns more then one pokemon only clefairy spawns which is how a nest works so this is something else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,good to know im really curious to see how the overall biomes work once we start getting more data about them still have yet to find myself an aerodactyl but this gives me hope
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have found one there once ever so i can not say this either i have used this clefairy thing to investigate for dragonites but since ninatic killed scanners and now the sightings list it is very hard to actually see what is there and like aerodactyl i have only seen in my local clefairy whateveritis the problem is it is not a large area and very long with lots of offshoots snorlax lapras and vaporeon have spawned near my house a few times but that isnt a clefairy area if this is a biome why am i seeing things from the biome around it at the pokestop with clefairy
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same ive caught a snorlax about i mile from home a lapras with of my home and also a vaporeon two blocks away but the clefairy biome and where i caught that one aerodactyl is miles away near where i work funnily enough ive caught two snorlaxes around there too
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,no youre fine to share that you are in the beta the nondisclosure agreement is simply about mechanics screenshots videos etc they wanted to create a safe place to try out different mechanics while testing much of the information they were protecting early on has now been published on todays niantic blog post though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nice try hanke
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,even if it didnt is it worth the risk
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nda
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nope
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,from what ive heard its like a no breach agreement i think i might have miss typed it ndanba something like that you cant say jack about the beta like whats in it or any mechanics in the game stuff like that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nda nondisclosure agreement you had it right the first time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks for the clarification
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yea thats what i thought i just didnt recognize the abbreviation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there is also a bug where using fingers on yes to evolve a pokemon will evolve her and then freeze on the evolved pokemon screen you have to force restart the app to get out of the frozen screen though i was really hoping for a double evolve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,even if theres a way to abuse itits still a bug
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,prestige world wide we put liquid paper on a bee and it died edit oh come on it wasnt meanspirited does nobody here appreciate step brothers
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your eevee has evolved tovapjolteon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true i tested the one where you use it to double power up something before it caps and it does work though youll have to reload pokemon go for the extra power up to show lets you get powerup past cap not going to exploit it again though doesnt seem right to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yes i do
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,faplteon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,please kill me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,triple finger vaporeon with ember and discharge d
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,dub power up doesnt require a restart to show for me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to be fair you probably should be able to power up one more time because now pokemon cap at on the server but already at on client side
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your comment plus the chimera in the link reminds me of those pighuman hybrids theyre cloning for spare organs how sad evil science at its finest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,otosa
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ooh imagine how buff a vape would be with spark and thunder i would never lose sleep over a water pokemon in a gym ever again
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,cant wait for lanturn
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,tomorrow ends half price discount of pokémon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it would be kind of sad to part with your actual first pokemon at the end of beta yeah i guess i can live without that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,definitely the same way i feel it would have been sweet to get the beta but im almost more happy i wasnt so that it wont take away from my first day experience with the full release
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,honestly the main reason i wanted in the beta is i want to know the pokestopgym layout of my areai know i know beta beta beta everythings subject to change but at least id know to some extent i know i could look at an ingress map but not all portals are gunna carry over and new ones might be added i want to know this for plannings sake to plan out routes and get a feel for where i need to adventure to in order to get the most out of my time in all honesty id rather not have the responsibilityobligation of going out and looking for bugs to report all the time i feel like taking a that kind of business outlook in the beta will really impact someones initial hype level for full release seeing it made step by step will make it not as magical starting up the full game
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,guys this will cheer us up
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,true that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i almost wonder if the testers will get a special badge or pokemon or something for being testers when the game goes live
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i agree its your first pokemon that youve wanted since you were years old
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really want to get something like a bulbasaur theyre really rare though or a growlithe or dratini as my first catch and then just go on a catching spree so i have a cool first pokemon the ones i catch on my first day are gonna be special even if theyre not the rarest
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i totally know what you mean but i doubt theyre gonna bother to add in new locations for pokestops cuz they can just take from ingress and they probs have enough to do
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my thoughts exactly i wanted to plan out some routes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yup
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,based on how pogo works will anybody actually keep their first pokemon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ya it might become a problem postrelease in the event that an area with minimal ingress activity has high pogo activity but for initial release theyll probably be roughly the same
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,better yet is the full list of workable creatures and a spreadsheet to calculate if your matchup will work
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,here you go edit i literally just searched in this subreddit bubblestrat and it is the first one on the list lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this weekend a cp very poor iv polywhirl with bubble appeared and i caught it i hope i can put him to some use some day
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thanks man💪
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,woah cant believe i didnt find it but thanks so much anyways👍
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gotcha fam 👌
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,because there are players like me that enjoy doing things like this xd
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you dont think you can hold the gym until collection time its usually better to leave the gym crippled instead of take it entirely if you had just taken the gym one battle knocks out your mon and gives the enemy prestige when they put their mon in but if you just cripple it it takes several battles to get to the battles have to be with lower level mon you dont need to revive or transfer the pokemon that would have been kod when they took back the gym and the enemy team has no idea who to retaliate against
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if a level gym with prestige is attacked and both pokémon are knocked out it subtracts prestige as to why theyre being left alone like that you got me
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they were a higher level but someone took them down just depends when they stopped battling or how many they beat in a row or whatever its the best to stop people prestiging vs a huge snorlax
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this has started happening near meits way worse than the stagnation or whatever was supposedly ruining the game before now the gyms just stagnate at prestige and the only interaction between the teams is not strategy but spite
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,same happens a lot never seen it before i usually had a stable gyms with low effort now im struggling to keep
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,taking gyms near useless i leave a lot at prestige on the last pokemon if they want it back that bad they have to prestige at least four times just to put another in that might easier to prestige against
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do this all the time if i dont need coins and i dont want to risk retaliation plus i usually gym solo and ya not worth putting my one poke in
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,bug is a possibility as ive had this happen to me i believe it is similar to the bug where you can prestige an enemy gym if they take it while your still training a week ago i was battling down a gym and someone on my team had joined in when the gym was one battle away from being empty we had gotten out of sync and i finished the battle and placed my snorlax i noticed the gym was still being battled and just figure the guy was of the third team so i watched the prestige drop to i waited to see if it continued to go down when i noticed it slowly going up the guy got it to and put his mon in no one else battle it and it was still the same prestige as i drove off havent ever bothered to try and recreate it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do this sometimes for different reasons in my living area im a lonely instinct player in a see of mystic so instead of taking over the gym there is in my town and having my mon kicked out a minute later i just take it almost down and let them enjoy the building up when im preparing a gym collect since im a lonesome instinct i can not just take over a gym put a mon in and expect it to stay in there for over so i bring gyms down to and then do my tour again this time running to get as many gyms as possible in the mean time things can happen either another instinct takes the gyms further down and i can just drop my mons or the other rival takes the gym down puts a mon in then i just need to beat the new mon once or the original team starts training but that goes slow enough for me to still quickly erase their progress
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i do this if i already collected in the hopes it stays like that till the next day if it does then its a quick gym for me to take
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i will regularly start battling a gym at stoplights and then drive away spamming the first defender the attack continues until that defender faints and the gym loses prestige the next defender appears and it errors out since im too far possible explanation but probably not likely considering that its a park
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its a very valid strategy i do it from time to time with gyms that i dont want to see high level by the dominant team to prevent it becoming a high level mystic in my case gym its a lot more effective to leave it at with low prestige than taking it over if i take it over my enemies can put in pokemon by just defeating my pokemon once if i leave it at low prestige my enemies have to train times to make it level it also saves potionsrevives how is that so weird and apparently hard to understand
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this after prestiging was nerfed and instinct towers were replaced by low level mystic gyms i started focusing on flipping them to collect my gym reward but if i have to fight five lvl gyms in a row i will eventually will lose one or more and would need to go back and retake it etc so sometimes i decide to soften up the enemy gyms in the area leave them at lvl so i can then power through them all quickly at collection time and not have wasted efforts now i am swimming in revives and potions and hundreds of badmoveset evo gym fodder pokes so i will be focusing on prestiging friendly gyms this week
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,so a combination of reasonable strategy and trolling because by your description it would be better to either leave the gym alone or knock it down completely but not claim it leave it alone if youre super pressed for healing items knock it down completely if items are reasonable these gyms are nearly equivalent to blank ones for rival players so the chances of the gym still being a rival later when you can claim and collect are approximately equivalent to leaving it blank if anything crippling the gym would make it slightly more likely to be an ally gym later requiring training to collect anything
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this was my first thought as for why probably a player is passing through takes one casual run at the gym and moves on
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ill leave gyms below prestige instead of takinf them it makes it harder for opposing team to put their pokemon in i wouldnt do it with gyms that would be left at prestige since that isnt that hard to train up i do it if the gym is left at prestige or below rare occasions and if remaining pokemon is snorlax or lapras that makes it super hard to train up although it usually doesnt work because some other player from my team just takes it down instead of leaving it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,possible explanation however ive seen level and gyms end up like this as well it would take multiple runs to bring those down to
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah i understand how the gym would end up that way if the situation was playerinduced what i dont understand is why a player would get it so close to claiming as their own but then purposefully avoid the coins and just leave the nowannoying gym for others to deal with why would anyone want to stop people prestiging now that gyms turn over so much more frequently i see nothing to gain from it ps these particular gyms turn over probably an average of a day since the latest prestige update
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,man i wish i could get im lucky to get those a few times a week congrats on all your riches relatively speaking
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,genuine question why dont you take the gym down and leave it empty it would be more xp with little to no change in healing item use depending on your party
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you can certainly make arguments against this strategy i am not advocating for it but i will provide additional clarification a person who cripples a gym generally has no intention of collecting from that particular gym they are trying to weaken the opposing teams and make them waste time and potions for example right now i am in gyms i dont need new gyms i just need to protect the ones i have as you know i cannot directly protect any of my gyms but if i can make my enemies spend time and resources doing anything that does not involve attacking one of my gyms from my perspective its exactly the same thing
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i honestly think its just to mess with people if i see a snorlax in a level gym with prestige i wont even consider it not that ill consider anything since the nerf but its doubly bad
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its called gym crippling and its done to annoy the other team typically the person already has their coins for the day they know theres not a chance of holding a new gym for hrs so itd just be a waste of potions a revive for them to drop their own pokemon in next best thing is to make life difficult for the enemy by making them prestige against a difficult highcp pokemon i dont do it myself but i see why people would
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i suspect it will be spoofers who dont want to reveal themselves but want to make it easier to come back later when they can hit gyms in quick succession and guarantee a higher coin collection it just means they will be fighting level gyms rather than level ones quicker for them and more convenient
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it makes it harder and more time consuming to train up for the other team in the hopes that they will try training up theirs instead of attacking ones i am in it is anonymous mystic is the enemy although i leave gyms alone that have mostly lower level players because i used to hate that i couldnt compete in gyms at those levels all of the above plus what i said about it not worth leaving one pokemon in it would be much faster for the other team to take my one poke down and immediately be able to get that gym up to level then it would e to train up a few times
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i like this strategy and dont forget the demoralization factor driving through an area and seeing half a dozen of my teams gyms under hurts my soul theyre not worth the effort to prestige up to level so they might as well be level enemy gyms ill often still build them up if im desperate for gym collection but im not happy about it see these gyms enough and it kinda makes you want to go play hello kitty island adventure
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thank you for the clarification i think i can understand that viewpoint now as you said there are certainly arguments against that line of thinking but it does have its own sort of logic to it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ugh yeah youre probably right was really hoping that there would be a reasonable nontrolling explanation for this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,in there latest updates they said something along the lines of continuing the beta invites for us nz and aus specifically leaving out jp meaning they more than likely havent forgot you but might be saving the second aus wave to go out with the second us wave as a stress test or something would be odd if they remembered to take jp off the list but forgot to take aus off the list so im sure youll get one eventually like i said maybe in coordination with the us second wave for the stress test as for a source i cant be bothered going to dig it up go read through their official blog and youll find it somewhere
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i really hope they send them out sooner rather than later haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,im not to worried about it the way i see it the game will feel more real for nontesters if you get into the beta and help with bugs youll be watching as the game is built step by step testing and reporting bugs youll have more of a business outlook to the game i feel that that business outlook will really ruin some of the initial hype and make the finish product feel a lot less magical it wont be wow look at this world of pokemon itll be wow look at all the hard work we did on this app and i dont want that at all i know we all want a peak at how the games coming along i just dont know that itll be worth it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what is everyones best catches in one day this was mine the gengar i evolved that day from a haunter i caught and the snorlax i hatched from an egg that day all the rest where caught at those cps in the wild this was about months ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,grimers last friday very odd that
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you are late to the party the pokedex has always expanded to the latest pokemon youve seen now that the babies have been released as soon as you see or hatch one your pokedex will expand
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,youre late the babies are generation pokemon meaning they have a larger pokedex number for instance elekid is so if you hatch him every number before will appear
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the irony that both youre late and the mention of babies in this thread two things i never want me girlfriend to say to me for atleast years
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the babies have very high pokédex numbers so if youve seen one of them your pokédex will greatly expand
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,search
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,check the search next time
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,when was the last time you played or visited the forum
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont think your girlfriend will tell you youre late
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tried thats why i posted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i tried thats why i posted
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i play every day but i have other stuff going on sorry for posting here i guess being a casual is unacceptable
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,shes constantly telling me im late im a terrible time keeper
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mean a simple search has this function and it should show several posts give it a try being casual has nothing to do with being lazy and expecting people to cater to your questions its like people forget they can search for themselves like they do on google
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pineco dratini commmon gligar mantine larvitar uncommmon sudowoodo rare aerodactyl ultrarare so out of eggs you got commons uncommons rares and ultrarares thats actually a pretty reasonable distribution httpsthesilphroadcomsciencesecreteggraritytierspokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,aerodactyls what are complaining about i havent seen one yet
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not biome dependent its rarity tiers the silph road did a study on it a quick search a hound link you to it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,pinecos gligars mantines sudowoodos dratini aerodactyls larvitars seems about right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,mareep is quite rare larvitar aero dratini thats good hatches out of ok rng luck i got chansey out of eggs of chanseys in a row its just rng ps it took me total eggs to hatch snorlax eggs now lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ampharos has too low of a cp to be worthwhile in gyms i have one caught one evolved and i wouldnt ever put them in a gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i still think there is a biome or pokestop or area effect my friend and i have hatched well over eggs and neither have hatched a porygon of course it is possible but we should have hatched by now im sure most of the people submitting data are hardcore and in cities or covering lots of ground to collect pokémon from hot spots so theyre inherently picking up eggs from areas of greater diversity than we usually are id be happy to be wrong and eventually hatch a porygon especially since none spawned in my are during valentines day but im not holding my breath
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lets see if i can remember since the start of gen and the change to the egg tiers never hatched an aerodactyl or lavitar ever and the only dratini i hatched was in pineco gligar sudowoodo chansey mareep cant complain here snorlax the first i ever hatched mantine miltank still have not hatched a lapras and none of my pineco have anywhere near perfect ivs
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i scanned an area near the sea yesterday its a small seaside village that spawns alot of magnemites and voltorbs anyway when i scanned it yesterday it had an ampharos spawned there too bad i live over an hour from there perhaps thats the best biome to find mareep and its evolutions in the seaside one that spawns electric types
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sudowoodo is rare i live in phoenix sudowoodo appears multiple times a day what am i missing is there a future evolution that i am not aware of
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yep what i wouldnt give my only remaining gen mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,httpsthesilphroadcomsciencesecreteggraritytierspokemongo
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,my total hatch was my first lapras hatch probably before it was my first chansey hope you get better luck than me on lapras
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are they good for prestiging though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,desert is the biome to find the mareep line
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its in the rare tier of eggs egg rarity does not correlate or correspond to wild rarity dratini for example is currently in the common egg tier sudowoodo does not get an evolution though it does get a baby form bonsly in gen
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,larvitar is in the uncommon tier though
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theyre pretty good not sure they are the best option though also my both have focus blast so theyre really not good for much of anything haha working on another one with hopefully a better moveset and will find out more then
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,nah this biome wasnt desert its that weird seaside biome where electric pokemon spawn ill keep checking to see if anymore spawn there also ive caught a mareep in what would be described as a mount moon biome perhaps mareep and its evolution more commonly spawn in the desert biome as you suggested
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i mean most of my electric type pokemon i use for prestiging against water types are always fainted so any new electric type would be good haha
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i live in a grass biome but there is a hot spot in my neighborhood that spawns rares and tons of fairt types ive caught of my mareep near that hot spot would that be the mountain biome for that small area
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,thats exactly the kind of biome where ive caught several mareep
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i am not saying that the biome where you saw that one ampharos was desert i am saying that the mareep family appears by far most often in the desert biome
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,well the location i caught my only mareep was in a biome where clefairy are common dragonite and snorlax spawn here every now and again tooi think this area is a mix of mt moon and other biomes though because i also get a lot of water pokemon in this area as well when i think about it the vast majority of pokemon in the pokedex spawned here at some point or other
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this is pretty much true for me too ive seen snorlax spawn by my house lapras by that spot that tends to spawn rares ive even seen a ninetales spawn in my neighborhood really the only thing i almost never see near my house is any electric or steel type which kind of surprises me that ive caught three mareep so far
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a cp blissey and i accidentally dropped it at the bottom rung of a level gym i felt terrible about it nearly immediately the short version is that i was careless the top rung was a tyrantir nothing i could top but in slot was a rhydon for some reason i thought my blissey was higher cp my plan was to put the blissey in prestige the gym up at least twice opening a slot and leaving it be but oops i screwed up to add insult to injury my cp snorlax which was in another gym when i began this came back at some point in the interim figuring i doomed the gym i was going to let it be but instead i tossed a ton of stuff at that blissey keeping some vaporeons in the back of my sixguy team i ripped through the whole gym a few times opening a spot and then some that was two weeks ago im still in the gym its now a level and my blissey is in spot
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,are people so proud of their blisseys that yes
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,remember alot of people still see this as a solo game so if their blissey sits from a bit thats all that matters to them we had one locally that people dumped mid range blissey into and thats it and within a couple days it goes down its just solo players only worried about getting a couple days out of thier mon
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a gym down the street from my apartment that i constantly have to tear down from level and take from mystic it doesnt matter whether i put in a cp magikarp or my cp blissey mystic is going to take it back within minutes of me taking it and i get no help from valor even though the gyms two blocks away are constant level valor so screw it ill put in blissey just to make it annoying for them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,to alot of reg playersblissy is difficult to defeat and time consumingand just dont bother to fight it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its also a tactic of lower level players who dont expect a gym to last generally a single blissey at least is enough to keep similar players from plowing the gym under until they can harvest what gyms theyre planning on followed by random high level player obliterating them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,a little unrelated but i read that at peevee instead of peeve
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,sometimes it seems i see quite a few players on these boards who would like to regulate everyone elses playto whats most convenient to them if i didnt read these boards i would think that putting blissey in a gym was a good team strategybut that isnt really the point being very english now that i know using a low cp blissey and mine at would be at the bottom rung inconveniences others i dont do it but if anything were to persuade me to start having fun with my hardearned blissey it would be somebody telling me i cant if ive opened up a gym ive got a right to place what i darn well please
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,some throw blissey in to test out recently acquired pokemon preferably in a contested gym where itll get taken out soon also if a feud develops over a gym to the point where its changing hands every couple minutes then dropping in blissey will ice the situation for a while its an effective strategy if youve developed pokemon to add prestige faster than an opponent can remove it against blissey
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,huh nobody mentioned it but an blissey is one that was a chansey hatch at level and was evolved but not powered up ive got a high iv blissey at that cp for this reason
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i use to think that people constantly placed blissey in the very bottom spots of gyms regardless of the level but after watching gyms go up and and down i finally realized that majority of people in my area place the blissey higher up in the gyms and then the opposing team will take the gyms down till they reach the blissey and then stop so i use to think all those bottom blissey players were idiots for preventing their own team from prestiging but in reality they just got stuck a the bottom cuz the other team couldnt finish it off made me laugh a little when i saw it happen a few times anyways at this point in my game blissey arent to bad to deal with anymore my pokemon are stronger and im wiser and not intimidated by them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,where i live gyms get taken down so fast anyway so id rather make it annoying for other teams than to make it easier for mine
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you dont have to fight the entire stack to level up the gym successfully i routinely prestige against blissey its not that big of a deal just pick two mons that are about the cp and dont dodge if you have a defender below blissey thats great fight him with something thats half the cp of the defender and run and get prestige over and over or if blissey is at the bottom sacrifice two or three mons by not dodging and push through him to get to the higher ones remember all have to be half the cp to get the full prestige of each battle fight v with ratticates to bat cleanup
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you might be missing that the blissey player didnt put their blissey on the bottom they may have placed it much higher and the gym have been brought down to the blissey being on the bottom quite common once a gym is nearly full putting a blissey in the bottom deters it from being taken down quickly or by lone casuals who cant get past it after a few attacks the casuals do manage to eliminate everything below the blissey however or the blissey player placed first and the other players all placed higher cp mons in the gym a case we saw locally recently because well they were dumb
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its annoying but its just a part of the game just walk on by dont prestige it another team will eventually take it down its the circle of life hakuna matata lifts meowth into the air
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,unfortunately if a low level player had the choice to place a low level mon in a gym vs not putting anything in fully knowing his participation hurts the team most likely i cant see many walking away from an open gym spot or a chance for gym participation
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,actually this is a really good strategy i hate it with a passion putting a blissey in a gym or a blissey in thats the third or fourth battle in a level ten gym causes massive fatigue personally i think its the best spot in the entire gym for blissey to be as it can singlehandedly guard the gym from a takedown i spent an hour trying to take down a gym that had a blissey in it at level and i couldnt get past it until about minutes in it was seriously torture it would do a good job of turning away anyone without a lot of patience and i used a ton of healing items in the process
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if your blissey is not on the top half of the gym its hurting the gym ive seen people actively kneecap their own team by putting blissey as the defender have some damn sense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,lol shes a troll
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it could also be the strongest thing a lower level player has they may have gotten the candy from the event but dont have a dragonite or tyrannitar or anything else stronger than it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,this happens to me but it is another team that purposely does this to sabotage gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,gyms around me are so busy and constantly changing teams that if i take one down i put my only blissey on it to make it last for at least mins before i take another one and take my daily coins
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,people who have a top defender just trying to get some use this is the worst case but people rarely play to help others if i have to deal with these for leveling the gym and i need to get more than to get my poke in i just find myself letting the gym fall before wasting my life like that any same cp poke can smash blissey for if you dont have an army of prestigers for getting in these such situations
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i purposely knock down gyms so that the blissey thats in it is at the bottom rung yall deserve it for putting that pink timesink in for others to deal with it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its what the trainer got that heshe thinks is hisher best defender or possibly a multiaccount enemy member that likes to give everyone on your team a pain 😁
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,some people with alt accounts on other teams will add midlow level blisseys to other teams gyms to make them hard to prestige
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i spent some time to prestige a level gym to today since im the last one i put a blissey at the bottom of the gym there were or gary just above me they were too weak as defenders so i sealed it with a blissey although my gym strategy knowledge is rather basic i think attackers will have to deal with my blissey over and over to lower the gym level this is how to use a blissey effectively right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,seems to me this presents an obvious deterrent to prestiging without actually presenting much of a challenge in battling i agree however a blissey is not that terrible in particular if you go against it with a team of prestigers matched to the subsequent defenders but in my opinion chansey is much worse because you cant even get the prestige by training against it with something lower in my opinion blissey should only be put in gyms in two cases when its higher cp than most usual gym defenders ie above the typical vaporeon when the gym is already level
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,blissey is a drag to prestige against but its not the end of the world it just changes my strategy a little bit for most gyms i look at the bottom cp pick that are half of that beat the first one then leave and repeat points per battle if im lucky the next pokémon in the gym has similar cp and i can take it out too for an extra points with blissey at the bottom i pick pokémon that are slightly lower cp than the blissey and then i rip through as many pokémon in the gym as i can sometimes the entire gym i might not get points per battle but im getting over and im beating more pokémon per battle so theres less time wasted entering a gym and preparing my team its not so timeinefficient actually
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a cp blissey that i caught in the wild i only use it in a gym when someone has pissed me off
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they will nerf blissey in the near future its a prediction but given the history of the game i would put money on it there was a gym heren that was stacked with blissey a week ago grr
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,isnt cp actually quite good for prestiging blisseys that low have bullseyes painted on their fat pink foreheads for primeapes and machokes and hitmons which naturally fall in the range to begin with and is the consensus primo range for prestiging anyway from my testing primeapes can reliably down up to cp blisseys of any moveset without timeout it takes at most two even with faintloop or dodging error
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive never avoided fighting another teams gym because it has a blissey no pokemon changes my mind when im standing there and i cycle through their gym if its at the bottom of a friendly gym ill come back in a day or so when its been taken because it stayed at level vulnerable and help rebuild it stronger somebody put a blissey at second place in a level gym a few days ago who does that i had to put a vape in just so people could prestige against something im still in that gym and its hovering around level if id put my gary in it would of stayed level and been gone days ago
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,not that low but i like to see blisseys on the bottom of level gyms this is because it keeps the lower level players out of the gym and i can wait a couple days before going to take my place in my own once it hits level itll be locked down for a few weeks
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,if you are talking about a level player who could easily put a higher cp pokemon than a blissey then yes but if you are talking about a level player who puts a blissey then hes completely correct a level player has at best a dragonite so hes better off putting a blissey than anything else
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it might surprise you but everyone who plays and enjoys the game doesnt hang out here and share the same thoughts i know that a lot of people play this game and almost exclusively discuss it in groups that have come to almost have their own language and morals for it just try to remember there are tons of people who just like the game they like catching pokemon they hear blissey is a brick wall and they like to contribute and show off also some of us find it absolutely perplexing that you play a game where you on a normal day might hold a gym for more than hours it doesnt matter if every single mon in a gym is indestructible every gym in my town is swimming in pokestops so theres no scenario in which someone wouldnt just be able to camp attack and restock without even moving
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,your posts upvotes outnumbers your posts downvotes by at least a hundred at the time of writing this comment am i missing something
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,any lower then and blissey is pretty weak power her up to a respectable cp so people can hide their garys and dragos behind her
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i actually dont mind if its a blissey around that means i can prestige with a machamp get prestige for that battle and move onto the higher cp prestige targets above the blissey the worst scenario is when the bottom if the gym has like or more blissey in a row at the bottom that generally means you need machamp or other good fighters to knock em out sucks up a ton of time and cuts deep into your overall prestige gain after you get past the blissey but then again i was lucky to get a machop nest in a big park after gen drop its right next to my house where i walk the dog our walks got really long and a another machop nest in the last migration last week at a park that i pass by all the time so i have multiple counterdp machamps now and enough candy to evolve another couple
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,peeve people who have blisseys
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,ive found that i enjoy this game a lot more when i dont try to figure out why other people do the things they do im sure they have their reasons me i have a few blisseys but i only use regularly zhdg for defense and phb for general prestiging the rest i could use but i personally find blissey boring and try to pick anything as a defender but her heck just thinking about it now people around here probably wonder why im always putting such weak pokemon in gyms sure i could throw in a blissey or snorlax like everyone else but i dont find that fun yeah i throw in my scizor in there or my espeon or my machamp with steel moves all the ones with fighting moves are oncall strictly for antiblissey duty or my beautiful maxed out so far jolteon basically i like to pick stuff thats fun to fight especially because im about to train that joint up clarifying if i took down the gym then ill put in whatever i want now if im driving by and i see a friendly gym with a spot open then yeah ill place an appropriately cped snorlaxvaperhydongyarados in there maybe even an egg tree if its a weaker gym also note obviously my ultimate goal isnt coins its having fun and enjoying the game i get about coins most nights but as a solo player its hard to get more than that around here pretty much every gym is level regardless of who controls it which is why i had to kinda stop caring about gyms in the first place sorry feel like i droned on a bit there its my bedtime and im postnightcap tldr people gonna do what people gonna do dont you mind
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,adding a blissey to a low run shields all the pokémon above it its not about prestige its about trying to stabilize a gym valor and instinct are at war in my city literally someone made a crass remark someone mouthed off now its intentional antagonizing and my home gym ie my job location gets blitzed and set up as blisseyxblisseyxxblisseyetc because location and schedule means only one instinct player can attack at a time and its an hour slot for everyone but the most high ranked to handle since you get down at a time i suspect some of the guys just farmed up low cp machamps to handle it but who knows
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,yeah they are a pain to prestige i usually just skip prestiging them and gauge the cp of the prestigers against the others in the gym i know people are happy to have blisseys but if you want the gym to grow putting yours at the bottom is a terrible terrible idea
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a blissey that i would put on top of level gyms come back the next day and find he was the only one left in it so couple weeks ago i placed him smack dab in the middle of a level gym and hes been resting comfortably ever sense so no bottom isnt good for blissey but neither is the very top of the gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have chancys i was able to catch maxed at my then level and ive since evolved and powered up to my current level so yes im going to use it i do understand the frustration of them though having prestiged against them before and so use it as my last poke to be put in a gym so shes my poké i drop around
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,just after valentines i posted this thread where the road helped me answer this question basically when you evolve a hatched chansey you get a blissey around cp that is deadly for your own team there is no good use for it and i bet plenty of trainers are like i was tempted to have two blisseys instead of one one but i listened to the road and powered up my best blissey and then i plopped her in a gym that had given me trouble by turning over every two days all winter long that was march and shes still there
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,there might be a simpler answer to this i have a friend who is in her who doesnt even know the names of her pokemon calls them stuff like this rock guy when showing them to me i could see casual players who dont even know what reddit is seeing blisseys all over gyms like the pink plague they are and thinking they ought to do it too without realizing the implications of it
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the only reason i can see for putting a blissey so low in a gym i popped my into a gym at level so its the pokemon in is to deter casual players that gym has stood for weeks when it used to change hands every other day im sure my fellow mystic players in my area are quite happy with that decision ive also helped level it to after but prestiging with a blissey so low in a gym is a nightmare i dont recommend putting such a low blissey in unless youre at or in that gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,another edit travelers respectfully what is with the downvotes too many kids on reddit globally and i dont mean this as their actual age
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,travelers respectfully what is with the downvotes too many people just love downvoting on this forum its a pity it hasnt reduced the mindless downvoting even with the introduction of shiny magikarp and lapras for upvoting stuff op is clearly trying to discuss an issue and strategy but hey some people just want to downvote everything they see been noticing a lot in this community of late watch as i get downvoted to hell for stating this
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have seen blissey in level gyms and its the only pokemon in the gym its annoying but what you going to do lol
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,is it a good strategy probably not but if this gym able to get to level with blissey chain it makes it some what difficult and time consuming because sometimes it will likely take to pokemon to take down each blissey and the prestige doesnt go down much it is hard to knock down a gym like that and it can be discouraging and then there are people like me who consistently knocking of my neighborhood gyms if it is not my color and when i see a blissey chain and that is valor i will go over and give it to prestige just so it will have a chance to survive and surely after about a month these gyms in my neighborhood has been converted back to valor it hasnt happened since prior to the gym meta changes i feel i made a huge contribution to my local team
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,you have to remember some people put their blissey on a gym at a time where it is higher than half way up the tiers after or so battles and pokemon being kicked off they end up at the bottom where they sort of stagnate the gym because there is nothing to train with and you end up timing out trying to prestige however this has worked out greatly in my favour having been sat above two blisseys at the bottom of a gym for the past week even though its only level i can see it from my house and nobody is bothering to contest it anymore
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i drop a pokemon lower than the blissey on purpose
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i saw a level mystic gym with a blissey on the bottom and walked right on by ill wait until someone flips that gym before i check back
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,they suck but its going to happen if i am trying to prestige my teams gym i usually just bring my machamp or exeggutors in to quickly defeat the blissey then focus on prestiging against easier mons another thing i do is make psa announcements on my local areas facebook group team instinct to say something like psa placing blisseys in gyms that are low level is not helpful to other trainers most agree and that hopefully puts the bug in their minds to be more cognizant about when placing blisseys in gyms
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i was taking down a gym when i got help from another in a car i put up my espeon and started to prestige but the other car left without putting in a mon she came back a few minutes later and left expecting a quick take down i called a friend to put her blissey into the gym once it was now its and still stands after days that other player wont even bother with a lowcp blissey its a really great defense
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,instinct has mostly disappeared from my area when i take over a gym i have little expectation that anyone will prestige it if i put in gyarados it will go down quickly to even a low level player if i put in blissey it might last long enough for a high level teammate to come join in in practice though these days i am saving my blissey for offense since it is poundhyper beam
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i take down a particular gym whenever im in the area i usually collect for or days before the yellow team takes it down never once has anyone from my team added a pokemon to this gym after ive claimed it so today i put my blissey in the gym to make it harder for the yellow team to knock me out im not hurting my team because nobody on my team ever seems to visit this particular gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,makes it harder to get knocked out of your own gym by an alt account
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,its poor strategy and inconsiderate but not the end of the world can prestige it up put in something easier and make open spots for others and demonstrate their idiocy if they check back more than likely theyre just trying to stay in that gym until they get in another to double the bonus they collect though i used to do that back when things were crazy harder mon in the first few gyms hoping theyd last long enough so id not have to return before collecting
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the worst prestiging that i had to do recently was a confusionice beam slowbro he hit so hard for a little guy and the misseddodge glitch made it brutal at least most of the time the fainted prestigers didnt really faint but i still burned a huge number of revives
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,it hurts your team to put a blissey low in a gym unless your making it a level thats why im waiting till i can max mine all the way out and i will be placing it hi up in a hi level gym
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,theres a gym by my house that has a high turnover rate ive been trying to make that decrease by taking down enemy gyms and then my family members and i put in chansey that way enemies will be less likely to attack if they have to go against chansey while it hurts my team in the short term i think it will help in the long term
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i have a friend who uses his brothers account different team than his main account when he sees a level gym with an open spot for that team he puts a low level chansey or blissey in there just to mess with them
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,what level are they though if they are a low level maybe it is a good pokemon for them if it was the first or thing put in it deters people attacking more than something even weaker really casual players may not attack a gym with that in it especially if someone puts a second blissey behind it what i personally hate is when people leave a thing in doesnt it have to be about for bubblestrat or something of some random low cp and it stays there at the bottom of the gym it doesnt really make prestiging any quicker once there are many higher level things in the gym i reenforce they dont use it to build the gym its like they see a free spot and just dump some random thing into the gym maybe you have something viable thats half the cp but maybe you dont and if its you never do my blissey is only since i stupidly tried to evolve a one in the hope of getting dazzling gleam and didnt if i dont have anything better left i might leave it when i found a gym if its in a spot that doesnt usually last till the next day it does seem to be less likely to be taken out by some random person i dont think people think ahead about what it would be like for people trying to prestige it past spots all the gyms in this area either dont last till the next day or are stuck at level for weeks and if you didnt get into it you never will even worse i think people cheat with accounts to kick the lowest pokemon out of their own teams level gym and once you know you were kicked out by a cheat you cant ever get back into the permanent level gym so unless its a location that often gets to level and stays there founding with a blissey doesnt really make a difference aside of lasting the few hours till you collect for the day people will think its better and so you get better results than leaving lapras vaporeon arcanine slowbro etc
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,the western part of town i live in is lvl valor gyms to the northeast lvl instinct gyms to the eastsouth i try to maintain four relatively clustered gyms around me to be mystic and they get to lvl and within a few hours every time they fell usually i can see all these gyms from home and i already watched them get torn down and after the sec winner lockdown they turned blue again with small cp blissey being put in and in all four of the gyms the name of that blue trainer was exactly the same as one yellow player that had been banned for cheating awhile ago with just a number added at the end of course nobody prestiged them after more mons went in above not much of a long shot to think what was happenning there right
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,strategy is combating high turnover i do this myself in my area there are gyms in walking distance in a rough triangle that generally dont last more than an hour the strategy is to put your toughest mon in the first gym you take then quickly get to the other two you just need that mon to hold on long enough for you to take the other two before you claim your reward
TheSilphRoad,not_removed,i dont see a problem with blisseys and prestiging just dont aim for points per match aiming for allows you to use a supereffective machamp fighting moves of the same cp and has no problem taking out the blissey on time and with hp to spare just dodge charge moves
